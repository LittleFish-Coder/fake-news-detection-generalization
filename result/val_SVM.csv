"George Timothy Clooney (born May 6, 1961) is an American actor, director, producer, screenwriter, and businessman. He has received three Golden Globe Awards for his work as an actor and two Academy Awards, one for acting in Syriana (2006) and the other for co-producing Argo (2012).  Clooney made his acting debut on television in 1978, and later gained wide recognition in his role as Dr. Doug Ross on the long-running medical drama ER from 1994 to 1999, for which he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. While working on ER, he began attracting a variety of leading roles in films, including the superhero film Batman & Robin (1997) and the crime comedy Out of Sight (1998), in which he first worked with director Steven Soderbergh, who would become a long-time collaborator. In 1999, he took the lead role in Three Kings, a well-received war satire set during the Gulf War.  In 2001, Clooney's fame widened with the release of his biggest commercial success, the heist comedy remake Ocean's Eleven, the first of what became a trilogy starring Clooney. He made his directorial debut a year later with the biographical spy comedy Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and has since directed the historical drama Good Night, and Good Luck (2005), the sports comedy Leatherheads (2008), the political drama The Ides of March (2011), and the war film The Monuments Men (2014). Clooney won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the Middle East thriller Syriana (2005), and subsequently earned Best Actor nominations for the legal thriller Michael Clayton (2007) and the comedy-dramas Up in the Air (2009) and The Descendants (2011). In 2013, he received the Academy Award for Best Picture for producing the political thriller Argo. He is the only person who has been nominated for Academy Awards in six different categories.[3]  In 2009, Clooney was included in Time's annual Time 100 as one of the ""Most Influential People in the World"".[4] He is also noted for his political and economic activism, and has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since January 31, 2008.[5][6][7] His humanitarian work includes his advocacy of finding a resolution for the Darfur conflict, raising funds for the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Armenian Genocide recognition, 2004 tsunami, 9/11 victims, and creating documentaries such as Sand and Sorrow to raise awareness about international crises. Clooney helped fund the March for Our Lives after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018. He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[8] In 2013, Clooney co-founded Casamigos Tequila with Rande Gerber and Michael Meldman.[9] It was sold to Diageo for $700 million in June 2017, with an additional $300 million possible depending on the company's performance over the next ten years.[10] According to Forbes annual ranking, he was the world's highest-paid actor for 2017-2018, scoring a career-high pretax paycheck of $239 million between June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018.[11] Since September 27, 2014, he has been married to British human rights lawyer Amal Clooney (née Alamuddin).  Early life  Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky.[12][13] His mother, Nina Bruce (née Warren),[14] was a beauty queen and city councilwoman. His father, Nick Clooney, is a former anchorman and television host, including five years on the AMC network.[15] Clooney has Irish, German, and English ancestry.[16] His maternal great-great-great-great-grandmother, Mary Ann Sparrow, was the half-sister of Nancy Lincoln, mother of President Abraham Lincoln.[17][18][19] Clooney has an older sister named Adelia (known as Ada).[20] Cabaret singer and actress Rosemary Clooney was an aunt.[12] Through Rosemary, his cousins include actors Miguel Ferrer, Rafael Ferrer, and Gabriel Ferrer, who is married to singer Debby Boone.[21]  Clooney was raised a strict Roman Catholic,[22] but said in 2006 that he did not know if he believed ""in Heaven, or even God"".[23] He has said, ""Yes, we were Catholic, big-time, whole family, whole group.""[24] He began his education at the Blessed Sacrament School in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. He attended St. Michael's School in Columbus, Ohio; then Western Row Elementary School (a public school) in Mason, Ohio, from 1968 to 1974; and St. Susanna School in Mason, where he served as an altar boy. The Clooneys moved back to Kentucky when George was midway through the seventh grade.[25] In middle school, Clooney developed Bell's palsy, a medical condition that partially paralyzes the face. The malady went away within a year. In an interview with Larry King, he stated that ""yes, it goes away. It takes about nine months to go away. It was the first year of high school, which was a bad time for having half your face paralyzed.""[24] He also described one positive outcome of the condition: ""It's probably a great thing that it happened to me because it forced me to engage in a series of making fun of myself. And I think that's an important part of being famous. The practical jokes have to be aimed at you.""[26]  After his parents moved to Augusta, Kentucky, Clooney attended Augusta High School. He has stated that he earned all As and a B in school,[12] and played baseball and basketball. He tried out to play professional baseball with the Cincinnati Reds in 1977, but he did not pass the first round of player cuts and was not offered a contract.[27] He attended Northern Kentucky University from 1979 to 1981, majoring in broadcast journalism, and very briefly attended the University of Cincinnati, but did not graduate from either.[28] He earned money selling women's shoes, insurance door-to-door, stocking shelves, working in construction, and cutting tobacco.[23][29]  Career  Early work, 1978–1993  Clooney's first role was as an extra in the television mini-series Centennial in 1978, which was based on the novel of the same name by James A. Michener and was partly filmed in Clooney's hometown of Augusta, Kentucky.[30][31] Clooney's first major role came in 1984 in the short-lived sitcom E/R (not to be confused with ER, the better-known hospital drama, on which Clooney also co-starred a decade later). He played a handyman on the series The Facts of Life and appeared as Bobby Hopkins, a detective, on an episode of The Golden Girls. His first prominent role was a semi-regular supporting role in the sitcom Roseanne, playing Roseanne Barr's supervisor Booker Brooks, followed by the role of a construction worker on Baby Talk, a co-starring role on the CBS drama Bodies of Evidence as Detective Ryan Walker, and then a year-long turn as Det. James Falconer on Sisters. In 1988, Clooney played a role in the comedy-horror film Return of the Killer Tomatoes.[32] In 1990, he starred in the short-lived ABC police drama Sunset Beat.[33] During this period, Clooney was a student at the Beverly Hills Playhouse acting school for five years.[34]  Breakthrough, 1994–1999  Clooney rose to fame when he played Dr. Doug Ross, alongside Anthony Edwards, Julianna Margulies, and Noah Wyle, on the hit NBC medical drama ER from 1994 to 1999. After leaving the series in 1999, he made a cameo appearance in the 6th season and returned for a guest spot in the show's final season.[35] For his work on the series, Clooney received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1995 and 1996.[36][37] He also earned three Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 1995, 1996, and 1997 (losing to co-star Anthony Edwards).[38][39]  Clooney began appearing in films while working on ER. His first major Hollywood role was in the horror comedy-crime thriller From Dusk till Dawn, directed by Robert Rodriguez and co-starring Harvey Keitel. He followed its success with the romantic comedy One Fine Day with Michelle Pfeiffer, and the action-thriller The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman. Clooney was then cast as Batman in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which was a modest box office performer, but a critical failure (with Clooney himself calling the film ""a waste of money"").[40] In 1998, he co-starred in the crime-comedy Out of Sight opposite Jennifer Lopez, marking the first of his many collaborations with director Steven Soderbergh.[41] He also starred in Three Kings during the last weeks of his contract with ER.[42]  After ER, 2000–2010  After leaving ER, Clooney starred in the commercially successful films The Perfect Storm (2000), a disaster drama; and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), a Coen brothers adventure comedy. In 2001, he teamed up with Soderbergh again for the heist comedy Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960s Rat Pack film of the same name, with Clooney playing Danny Ocean, originally portrayed by Frank Sinatra. It is Clooney's most successful film with him in the lead role, earning $451 million worldwide (he appeared, but did not star, in Gravity, which has a $723 million worldwide box office).[44][45] The film inspired two sequels starring Clooney, Ocean's Twelve in 2004[46] and Ocean's Thirteen in 2007.[47]  In 2001, Clooney and Soderbergh co-founded Section Eight Productions, for which Grant Heslov was president of television. Clooney made his directorial debut in the 2002 film Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, based on the autobiography of TV producer Chuck Barris. Though the film did not do well at the box office, critics stated that Clooney's directing showed promise.[48]  In 2005, Clooney starred in Syriana, which was based loosely on former Central Intelligence Agency agent Robert Baer's memoirs of his service in the Middle East. Clooney suffered an accident on the set of Syriana, which caused a brain injury with complications from a punctured dura.[49] The same year he directed, produced, and starred in Good Night, and Good Luck, a film about 1950s television journalist Edward R. Murrow's famous war of words with Senator Joseph McCarthy. At the 2006 Academy Awards, Clooney was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Good Night, and Good Luck, as well as Best Supporting Actor for Syriana. He won the Oscar for his role in Syriana.[50]  Clooney next appeared in The Good German (2006), a film noir directed by Soderbergh that is set in post-World War II Germany. In August 2006, Clooney and Heslov started the production company Smokehouse Pictures. In October 2006, Clooney received the American Cinematheque Award, which honors someone in the entertainment industry who has made ""a significant contribution to the art of motion pictures"".[51] On January 22, 2008, Clooney was nominated for an Academy Award (and many other awards) for Best Actor for Michael Clayton (2007). Later that year, he directed his third film, Leatherheads, in which he also starred. On April 4, 2008, Variety reported that Clooney had quietly resigned from the Writers Guild of America over a dispute concerning Leatherheads. Clooney, who is the director, producer, and star of the film, claimed that he had contributed in writing ""all but two scenes"" of it, and requested a writing credit alongside Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly, who had worked on the screenplay for 17 years. Clooney lost an arbitration vote 2–1, and withdrew from the union over the decision. He became a ""financial core status"" non-member, meaning he no longer has voting rights, and cannot run for office or attend membership meetings, according to the WGA's constitution.[52]  He next co-starred with Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey in the war parody comedy film The Men Who Stare at Goats, which was directed by Heslov and released in November 2009. Also in November 2009, he voiced Mr. Fox in Wes Anderson's animated feature Fantastic Mr. Fox. The same year, Clooney starred in the comedy-drama Up in the Air, which was initially given limited release, and then wide-released on December 25, 2009. For his performance in the film, which was directed by Jason Reitman, he was nominated for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild Award, BAFTA, and an Academy Award.[53] 2010 saw the release of The American, based on the novel A Very Private Gentleman by Martin Booth and directed by Anton Corbijn. Clooney played the lead role, and was a producer of the film.[54]  2011–present  As of 2011, Clooney is represented by Bryan Lourd, co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency (CAA).[55] In 2011 Clooney starred in The Descendants as a husband whose wife has an accident that leaves her in a coma.

He is the only person in Academy Award history to be nominated for Oscars in six different categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay.[56]  Clooney co-starred with Sandra Bullock in Gravity (2013), a space thriller directed by Alfonso Cuarón.[57] He co-wrote, directed and starred in The Monuments Men, an adaption of The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History by Robert M. Edsel.[58] Clooney also produced August: Osage County (2013), an adaptation of the play of the same name. The film stars Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts.[59] His next film was Tomorrowland (2015), a science fiction adventure film in which he played Frank Walker, an inventor.[60] Later in the year, he was featured as himself in the Netflix Christmas musical comedy A Very Murray Christmas, starring Bill Murray.[61]  Hail, Caesar!, a comedy from the Coen brothers set in the Hollywood film industry in the 1950s, premiered in February 2016. Clooney portrayed Baird Whitlock, a Robert Taylor-type film star who is kidnapped during the production of a film. Josh Brolin co-starred as fixer Eddie Mannix.[62] Clooney reunited with Julia Roberts for the Jodie Foster-directed thriller Money Monster (2016), playing the host of a television show that investigates conspiracies on commerce and Wall Street, who is taken hostage by a bankrupt viewer given a bad tip.[63] His next directorial project was the 1950s-set crime comedy Suburbicon (2017), starring Matt Damon, Julianne Moore, and Oscar Isaac, from a script penned by the Coen brothers in the 1980s, that they had originally intended to direct themselves.[64]  He received the 2018 AFI Life Achievement Award on June 7, 2018.[65]  Activism and public advocacy  Political views  Clooney supported President Obama's campaigns in the 2008[66] and 2012 presidential elections.[67] He is a supporter of gay rights.[68] In 2003, he opposed the Iraq War, saying, ""You can't beat your enemy anymore through wars; instead you create an entire generation of people seeking revenge... Our opponents are going to resort to car bombs and suicide attacks because they have no other way to win. ... I believe [Donald Rumsfeld] thinks this is a war that can be won, but there is no such thing anymore. We can't beat anyone anymore.""[69] In 2016, Clooney endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential election.[70]  Humanitarian work  Clooney in Abéché , Chad, in January 2008 with the UN  Clooney is involved with Not On Our Watch Project, an organization that focuses global attention and resources to stop and prevent mass atrocities, along with Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub.[71] In February 2009, he visited Goz Beida, Chad, with New York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof.[72] In January 2010, he organized the telethon Hope for Haiti Now,[73] which collected donations for the 2010 Haiti earthquake victims.[74]  In March 2012, Clooney was featured with Martin Sheen and Brad Pitt in a performance of Dustin Lance Black's play, '8'—a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage—as attorney David Boies.[75] The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights.[76][77] In September 2012, Clooney offered to take an auction winner out to lunch to benefit the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN). GLSEN works to create a safe space in schools for children who are or may be perceived to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.[78]  Darfur  Clooney discusses Sudan with President Barack Obama at the White House in October 2010.  Clooney has advocated a resolution of the Darfur conflict.[79] He spoke at a 2006 Save Darfur rally in Washington, D.C. In April 2006, he spent ten days in Chad and Sudan with his father to make the TV special ""A Journey to Darfur"" reflecting the situation of Darfur's refugees, and advocated for action. The documentary was broadcast on American cable TV as well as in the UK and France. In 2008, it was released on DVD with the sale proceeds being donated to the International Rescue Committee.[80][81][82][83] In September of the same year, he spoke to the UN Security Council with Nobel Prize-winner Elie Wiesel to ask the UN to find a solution to the conflict and to help the people of Darfur.[84] In December, he visited China and Egypt with Don Cheadle and two Olympic winners to ask both governments to pressure Sudan's government.[85]  On March 25, 2007, he sent an open letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, calling on the European Union to take ""decisive action"" in the region given the failure of Sudan President Omar al-Bashir to respond to UN resolutions.[86] He narrated and was co-executive producer of the 2007 documentary Sand and Sorrow.[87] Clooney also appeared in the documentary film Darfur Now, a call-to-action film released in November 2007 for people all over the world to help stop the Darfur crisis.[88] In December 2007, Clooney and fellow actor Don Cheadle received the Summit Peace Award from the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates in Rome. In his acceptance speech, Clooney said that ""Don and I ... stand here before you as failures. The simple truth is that when it comes to the atrocities in Darfur ... those people are not better off now than they were years ago.""[89] On January 18, 2008, the United Nations announced Clooney's appointment as a UN messenger of peace, effective January 31.[5][6]  Clooney conceived of and, with John Prendergast – human rights activist, co-founder of the Enough Project, and Strategic Advisor for Not on Our Watch Project – initiated the Satellite Sentinel Project (SSP), after an October 2010 trip to South Sudan. SSP aims to monitor armed activity for signs of renewed civil war between Sudan and South Sudan, and to detect and deter mass atrocities along the border regions there.[90]  Clooney and John Prendergast co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed piece in May 2011, titled ""Dancing with a dictator in Sudan"", arguing that:  President Omar al-Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, is escalating bombing and food aid obstruction in Darfur, and he now threatens the entire north-south peace process ... the evidence shows that incentives alone are insufficient to change Khartoum's calculations. International support should be sought immediately for denying debt relief, expanding the ICC indictments, diplomatically isolating the regime, suspending all non-humanitarian aid, obstructing state-controlled bank transactions and freezing accounts holding oil wealth diverted by senior regime officials.[91]  On March 16, 2012, Clooney was arrested outside the Sudanese Embassy for civil disobedience.[92][93] He intended to be arrested when he planned the protest.[93] Several other prominent participants were also arrested, including Martin Luther King III.[93] Clooney has been described as one of the most strident critics of Omar al-Bashir.[94]  Armenian Genocide  George Clooney is a keen supporter of the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. He is one of the chief associates of the 100 Lives Initiative, a project which aims to remember the lives lost during the event.[95] As part of the initiative, Clooney launched the Aurora Prize, which awards to those who risk their lives to prevent genocides and atrocities.[95][96] Clooney had also urged various American government officials to support the United States' recognition of the Armenian Genocide.[96] Clooney visited Armenia to commemorate the 101st anniversary of the event in April 2016.[97]  Syria  In May 2015, Clooney told the BBC that the Syrian conflict was too complicated politically to get involved in and he wanted to focus on helping the refugees.[98] In March 2016, he and his wife, Amal Clooney, met with Syrian refugees living in Berlin to mark the fifth anniversary of the conflict, before meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to thank her for her Germany's open-door policy.[99]  Gun control  In 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, the Clooneys pledged $500,000 to the March for Our Lives and said they would be in attendance.[100]  Personal life  Relationships  Clooney married actress Talia Balsam in 1989; they divorced in 1993.[101]  Clooney and Alamuddin at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in 2016  Clooney became engaged to British-Lebanese human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin on April 28, 2014.[102][103] In July 2014, Clooney publicly criticized the British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mail after it claimed his fiancée's mother opposes their marriage on religious grounds.[104] When the tabloid apologized for its false story, Clooney refused to accept the apology. He called the paper ""the worst kind of tabloid. One that makes up its facts to the detriment of its readers.""[105] On August 7, 2014, Clooney and Alamuddin obtained marriage licenses at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea of the United Kingdom.[106] Alamuddin and Clooney were officially married on September 27, 2014, at Ca' Farsetti.[107] They were married by Clooney's friend Walter Veltroni, the former mayor of Rome.[108] In 2015, Clooney and Alamuddin adopted a rescue dog, a bassett hound named Millie, from the San Gabriel Valley Humane Society.[109] On February 9, 2017, it was reported by the CBS talk show, The Talk, that Amal was pregnant, and that they were expecting twins.[110] On June 6, 2017, Amal gave birth to a daughter, Ella, and a son, Alexander.[111]  Real estate  Clooney's main home is in Los Angeles. He purchased the 7,354-square-foot (683.2 m2) house in 1995 through his George Guilfoyle Trust. His home in Italy is in the village of Laglio, on Lake Como,[112] near the former residence of Italian author Ada Negri.[113] Clooney also maintains a home in Los Cabos, Mexico, that is next door to the home of Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber.[114] In 2014, Clooney and his new British wife Amal Alamuddin bought the Grade II listed[115] Mill House on an island in the River Thames at Sonning Eye in Oxfordshire, England[116] at a cost of around £10 million.[117]  Motorcycle accidents  On September 21, 2007, Clooney and then-girlfriend Sarah Larson were injured in a motorcycle accident in Weehawken, New Jersey, when his motorcycle was hit by a car. The driver of the car reported that Clooney attempted to pass him on the right,[118] while Clooney said that the driver signaled left and then decided to make an abrupt right turn and clipped his motorcycle. On October 9, 2007, more than two dozen staff at Palisades Medical Center were suspended without pay for looking at Clooney's medical records in violation of federal law.[119]  On July 10, 2018, Clooney was hit by a car while riding a motorcycle to film set in Sardinia.

However, Clooney has also lent his voice to South Park as Sparky the Dog in ""Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride"" and as the emergency room doctor in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Clooney was caricatured in the American Dad! episode ""Tears of a Clooney"", in which Francine Smith plans to destroy him.[134]  Director Alexander Cartio made his debut feature film, Convincing Clooney, about a Los Angeles artist who, faced with rejection as an actor and screenwriter, arrives at a master plan trying to get Clooney to star in his first-ever low-budget short film. The movie was released on DVD in November 2011.[135]  Awards and nominations  Throughout his career, Clooney has won two Academy Awards, one for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Syriana[136] and one for Best Picture as one of the producers for Argo, as well as a BAFTA and a Golden Globe.

"Do you feel it in your fingers? Do you feel it in your toes?  As you may or may not have noticed, Christmas is all around us. ‘Tis the season for novelty pop singles, for children’s nativity plays, for office holiday parties, for happy reunions at airports, for Mariah Carey — in short, for Love Actually.  Richard Curtis’ “ultimate romantic comedy” has been charming viewers every holiday season (and a lot of other seasons, too, if we’re being honest) since it first hit theaters in 2003. In the layered collection of loosely-connected love stories taking place over the weeks leading up to one Christmas in London, everybody has their own favorite Love Actually moment — from a politician’s personal dance party to a controversial cue-card confession to “Are you from England?” But which of the film’s nine narrative threads reigns supreme?  We’ve put them all in order from worst to best, just because it’s Christmas (and at Christmas you tell the truth). Check out our ranking, actually, below!  9. Juliet, Peter, and Mark  It’s cool that Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, and Chiwetel Ejiofor all went on to be insanely famous and beloved. You know what’s not cool? Every single thing about their storyline, especially those unforgivably creepy cue cards. The whole thing leaves a worse taste in my mouth than Juliet’s “terrible taste in pie.” How can Juliet and Mark never tell Peter about their weird little moment? How did Mark even fall in love with Juliet if he never deigned to have a conversation with her… because he was already in love with her?! All the love that exists between this trio is built on secrets and lies. How do we all stand for it every Christmas? To me, this is not perfect.  8. Harry and Karen (and Mia, I guess)  Harry and Karen’s love gone wrong has got to be the most crushing story in the movie because while there’s still hope for Sarah’s heart to mend, Karen knows that “life will always be a little bit worse” following the discovery of her husband’s confirmed infidelity (and their subdued airport reunion at the end reinforces that realization). And if the image of Emma Thompson crying while listening to Joni Mitchell doesn’t absolutely shatter your heart, I honestly have no idea what will.  7. Sarah, Karl, and Michael  The attraction between Sarah and Karl is very underdeveloped, but I guess the gist is that Laura Linney’s radiant goodness and Rodrigo Santoro’s unreasonable handsomeness just inexorably drew them to each other until Karl finally asked Sarah to dance. Alas, while Sarah has probably the biggest heart of anyone in this whole movie filled with great big stupid hearts, there just isn’t enough room in it for her to be both devoted to her brother Michael and to begin a relationship with beautiful, beautiful Karl. Don’t worry, Sarah! Patrick Dempsey will be yours in 14 short years.  6. Colin and the American girls  When we first hear self-proclaimed “God of Sex” Colin tell his friend Tony that he plans to cross the Atlantic to find a girlfriend — based on the infallible logic that no American girl will be able to resist his British accent — we accept it as a dumb cliché and brace ourselves for Colin’s inevitable humiliation at the hands of all the smart American girls who will reject him. But no! It’s got to be Love Actually’s cleverest joke (if one of its rather shallower love stories) that Colin was absolutely right. Good thing that suitcase was chock-a-block full of condoms!  5. John and Judy  The simplest, and one of the sweetest, love stories in Love Actually is that of John and “Just Judy,” who feel no awkwardness whatsoever as they nakedly simulate sex in their work together as body doubles, but blush and giggle and stutter their way through their shy flirtations. When Judy finally admits, “all I want for Christmas… is you!” it lacks the flash of some of the other romantic climaxes, but is no less filled with feeling.  4. Jamie and Aurélia  Yes, their (sort of) bilingual proposal scene is adorable, but it’s also pretty schmaltzy, capitalizing on that cheapest of rom-com setups, the declaration of love before an audience of strangers. (Really, was it necessary for Jamie to attract a whole parade of Aurélia’s neighbors on his way to propose to her?) But it’s hard to resist Colin Firth’s broken Portuguese — or that soaring Love Actually score, played to greatest effect here.  3. David and Natalie  Prime Minister David and his household staffer Natalie first bond, in a quiet unspoken British way, over her tendency to curse and his taste for chocolate biscuits. His door-to-door search of her in “the dodgy end” of Wandsworth is very charming, of course, but his greatest moment as a romantic hero is when he stands up to Billy Bob Thornton’s sleazy American president (we get it, Love Actually, Americans have no class) at a press conference. Yes, he was talking about politics, but there’s no way he would have spoken with such passion if he hadn’t come to really hate POTUS for harassing Natalie.  2. Billy Mack and Joe  Love Actually knew that not all love stories had to be romantic a solid decade before Frozen hit us over the head with it! When rock & roll sellout Billy Mack figures out that his decades-old friendship with “my fat manager” Joe means more to him than anything else, he delivers perhaps the movie’s greatest confession of love: “It’s a terrible, terrible mistake, Chubs, but you turned out to be the f—ing love of my life.”  1. Daniel, Sam, and Joanna  The Christmas concert! The airport sprint! Love Actually’s two greatest set pieces both belong to little Sam and his crush Joanna, and the movie’s youngest heroes would probably earn the top spot on the merit of those scenes alone. But what makes their sweet love story really soar above the rest is how it’s colored by the loss of Sam’s mother at the beginning of the film, and how much Sam’s pursuit of Joanna, assisted by his also-grieving stepfather Daniel, is about embracing and overcoming the “total agony” of love of all kinds. Finally, as additional confirmation that this storyline has been sprinkled with magic Christmas dust, Claudia Schiffer shows up at the end to date Daniel! Love actually is all around.",0
"Advertisement  The royal family gathered this morning for a traditional Easter Sunday Service - at the chapel where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will marry on May 19th.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, expecting their third child within weeks, broke usual protocol by arriving after the Queen at the Easter Mattins Service at St George's Chapel in Windsor.  The couple eschewed the downhill walk and took a royal car to the entrance, arriving several minutes after the Queen, who also arrived by car and was travelling without the Duke of Edinburgh, 96, who did not attend the service.  Although Meghan and Harry also chose not to appear at the chapel where they'll tie the knot next month; the Queen, dressed in cerise, was joined by Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall all also in attendance for the seasonal service.  Arriving without husband Mike Tindall and daughter Mia Grace, Zara did take the short downhill walk, showing off her blossoming bump in a blue bespoke Séraphine coat and hat by Jane Taylor as she chatted with Princess Beatrice, her sister Eugenie and husband-to-be Jack Brooksbank at the chapel's entrance.

Despite being eight months' pregnant, the Duchess has yet to park her favourite heels and finished off her smart look with a pair of towering caramel-hued shoes and matching clutch purse.

"Roger Ailes, Former Fox News CEO, Dies At 77  Enlarge this image toggle caption Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images  Former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes has died, the network says, citing a statement from the late executive's family. Ailes resigned from his post leading Fox News last July, amid allegations of sexual harassment. He was 77.  Ailes helped found Fox News in 1996. On Thursday, the network initially announced his death by citing the Drudge Report, which had published a statement from Ailes' wife, Elizabeth.  According to Fox News, that statement reads:  ""I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, Roger Ailes, passed away this morning. Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many. He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise — and to give back.""  Remembrances Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Listen · 4:36 4:36  Anchors of the channel's morning show Fox & Friends were noticeably emotional in announcing Ailes' death.  ""Beth, you are in our thoughts and prayers,"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, ""and so is Zachary, their beautiful son. Roger, rest in peace.""  Ailes was famous for his shrewd leadership of Fox, including his focus on airing conservative opinions and hiring anchors and reporters with big personalities. But he left Fox with a tarnished legacy, facing legal actions over allegations of sexual harassment.  Ailes denied accusations that he built a culture at Fox that encouraged harassment, after a lawsuit by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson prompted other women at the network, including high-profile anchor Megyn Kelly, to step forward with similar claims. He abruptly resigned last July.  In the decades before he created a ratings juggernaut in Fox News, Ailes worked in politics, serving as a media adviser and consultant — most famously for Richard Nixon, whom Ailes helped to win the presidency in 1968. He later worked for other Republican leaders, from Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush to New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  Ailes was a producer of the variety and talk program The Mike Douglas Show when he met Nixon. In the years that followed, as NPR's David Folkenflik has reported, Ailes ""kept toggling between producing television specials and serving as a political consultant, sometimes doing both at once.""  The architect of Fox News was also close to President Trump, to whom he gave a weekly slot on Fox & Friends — a show that the president has regularly touted in his tweets from the White House.  Trump ""sort of represents Roger Ailes' legacy of 50 years of using television to advance a style — a populist style of conservative politics,"" journalist and author Gabriel Sherman told NPR's Terry Gross last summer.  Sherman, who wrote a biography of Ailes titled The Loudest Voice In The Room, also spoke to Terry back in 2014, when his book was first published.  Discussing Ailes' impact on politics and culture in the U.S., Sherman said, ""One of Ailes' lasting legacies will be that for millions of Americans, news is now no longer viewed as a way to be informed about the world; it's a way of gathering information that advances your side.""",0
"American serial child sexual abuser and physician  Lawrence Gerard Nassar (born August 16, 1963) is an American convicted serial child molester who was the USA Gymnastics national team doctor and an osteopathic physician at Michigan State University.  Nassar's cumulative criminal acts of sexual assault were the basis of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, in which he was accused of molesting at least 250 girls and young women and 1 young man including a number of well-known Olympic gymnasts, dating as far back as 1992.[1] He has admitted to ten of the accusations.  In July 2017, Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to child pornography charges. On January 24, 2018, Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in a Michigan state prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of sexual assault of minors.[2][3] On February 5, 2018, he was sentenced to an additional 40 to 125 years in prison after pleading guilty to an additional three counts of sexual assault.[4] His federal and state sentences are to run consecutively.[5][3]  Personal life  Nassar was born on August 16, 1963, in Farmington Hills, Michigan, to Fred Nassar (1925–2000)[6] and Mary Nassar.[7] In 1978, he began working as a student athletic trainer with the women's gymnastics team at North Farmington High School. He had received the assignment on the recommendation of his older brother, Mike, who was an athletic trainer at the school. Nassar graduated from North Farmington High School in 1981.[8][9]  He went on to study kinesiology at the University of Michigan, where he earned his undergraduate degree in 1985.[9] During this time, he worked with the university's football and track and field teams.[10]  He married Stephanie Lynn Anderson on October 19, 1996, at St. John's Catholic Church in East Lansing.[8] The couple has two daughters and a son.[8] Stephanie Nassar was granted a divorce from her estranged husband in July 2017 and gained full custody of the three children.[11][12] At the time of his arrest by federal agents in December 2016, Nassar lived in Holt, Michigan.[8]  Despite the charges of sex crimes that had been made public against him, Nassar still decided to run for Holt School Board in 2016; he received 21% of the votes.[10]  Medical career  In 1986, Nassar began working as an athletic trainer for the USA Gymnastics national team.[10] In 1993, he graduated from the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine as a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. He went on to complete his residency training in family practice at St. Lawrence Hospital. In 1997, Nassar completed a fellowship in sports medicine[10] and began working as an assistant professor at MSU's Department of Family and Community Medicine in the College of Medicine, earning $100,000 annually.[8] Nassar is listed as a co-author on at least six research papers on the treatment of injuries in gymnasts.[13]  Nassar began working as a team doctor at Holt High School in 1996.[10]  Gymnastics career  In 1988, Nassar began working with John Geddert at Twistars.[10]  From 1996 to 2014, Nassar was the national medical coordinator for USA Gymnastics.[10]  Sexual assault accusations and convictions  In 2015, USA Gymnastics cut ties with Nassar ""after learning of athlete concerns."" In September 2016, The Indianapolis Star revealed that Rachael Denhollander and another former gymnast had accused Nassar of sex abuse.[14] Michigan State fired him on September 20; he had been reassigned from clinical and teaching duties a month earlier.[15]  In February 2017, three former gymnasts—Jeanette Antolin, Jessica Howard and Jamie Dantzscher—gave an interview with 60 Minutes in which they said that Nassar had sexually abused them. The gymnasts also alleged that the ""emotionally abusive environment"" at the national team training camps run by Béla and Márta Károlyi at the Karolyi Ranch near Huntsville, Texas gave Nassar an opportunity to take advantage of the gymnasts and made them afraid to speak up about the abuse.[16] Rachael Denhollander, one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar,[17] said in court in May 2017 that Nassar sexually abused her on five doctor's visits in 2000, when she was 15 years old.[18]  Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney, using the #MeToo hashtag on Twitter, stated that Nassar repeatedly molested her, starting when she was 13 years old and until she retired from the sport in 2016.[19] Maroney subsequently filed a lawsuit against Nassar, Michigan State University, the United States Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.[20]  The lawsuit accused USA Gymnastics of covering up the sexual abuse by paying Maroney $1.25 million to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Maroney's attorney, John Manly, referred to Nassar as a ""pedophile doctor"".[21]  During a 60 Minutes interview, Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman also said that Nassar had sexually abused her.[22]  Raisman stated that Nassar molested her when she was 15 years old.[23] Gabby Douglas was criticized by fellow Olympic teammate Simone Biles and others for sending a tweet that they interpreted as criticizing Raisman and of ""victim-shaming"",[23] stating that ""dressing in a provocative/sexual way incites the wrong crowd.""[24] Douglas later apologized for the tweet,[25] and said she was also a victim of Nassar's abuse.[26]  Former national team member Maggie Nichols accused Nassar of abusing her. She documented the ways he ""groomed"" her by connecting with her on Facebook and complimenting her appearance on numerous occasions.[27] According to court filings and interviews, it was Nichols and her coach, Sarah Jantzi, who reported Nassar to USA Gymnastics officials on June 17, 2015, after the coach overheard Maggie and another gymnast talking about Nassar's behavior.[28] Simone Biles came forward shortly after with accounts that she too had been sexually abused by Nassar,[29] and Jordyn Wieber made a statement at Nassar's court sentencing in which she also accused Nassar of sexually abusing her during her time at USA Gymnastics.[30][31]  In November 2016, Nassar was indicted on state charges of sexual assault of a child from 1998 to 2005; the crimes allegedly began when the victim was six years old.[32] Ultimately, he was charged with 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with minors: fifteen in Ingham County and seven in neighboring Eaton County.  The allegations asserted that Nassar had molested seven girls under the guise that he was providing legitimate medical treatment at his home and at a clinic on the MSU campus.[33]  Nassar was arrested by the FBI in December 2016 after agents found more than 37,000 images of child pornography and a video of Nassar molesting underage girls.[34] On April 6, 2017, his medical license was revoked for three years.[35]  On July 11, 2017, Nassar pleaded guilty to receiving child pornography in 2004, possession of pornographic images of children dating from 2004 to 2016, and tampering with evidence by destroying and concealing the images. On December 7, 2017, U.S. District Judge Janet T. Neff sentenced Nassar to 60 years in federal prison.[5] If he survives that sentence, he will be on supervised release for the rest of his life.[5]  On November 22, 2017, Nassar pleaded guilty in Ingham County Circuit Court to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with minors under the age of sixteen. He admitted molesting seven girls, three of whom were under the age of thirteen. On November 29, he pleaded guilty to an additional three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County.[36] As of January 18, 2018, 135 women had accused Nassar of sexual assault while he worked for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University.[37] During the following week, the number rose to 150.[38] In a lawsuit that was filed in April 2017, a woman claimed that Nassar had sexually assaulted her while he was still in medical school in 1992.[1]  On January 24, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentenced Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison for the sexual assault of minors.[2] Aquillina allowed Nassar's accusers to present extended victim impact statements and dismissed objections raised to this move by Nassar.[37] In sentencing, the judge informed Nassar that he had missed numerous chances to receive treatment for his sexual urges; Nassar had been aware of these urges from a young age. She added that there were likely dozens of additional victims who had not come forward. She made it clear that she did not intend for Nassar to ever be free again.[3]  Nassar was practicing without a Texas medical license while he worked at the Karolyi Ranch in Huntsville. According to gymnast McKayla Maroney, this is the place where Nassar molested young women for over 15 years. The practice of medicine without a license in Texas is a third-degree felony, although it is rarely prosecuted.[39]  On January 31, a Michigan judge stated that thus far 265 girls had accused him of sexual misconduct.[40]  On February 5, Eaton County Circuit Judge Janice Cunningham sentenced Nassar to 40 to 125 years in prison for the three counts of criminal sexual assault to which he had pleaded in November.[41] Nassar apologized for his years of abuse, saying that the impact his victims' statements had on him ""pales in comparison"" to the suffering he inflicted on them. Cunningham was unmoved, saying that she believed Nassar was still in ""denial"" about the ""devastating impact"" of his crimes.[4]  The Eaton County sentence will run concurrently with the Ingham County sentence. In turn, Nassar's state sentences will begin upon completion of his federal child pornography sentence; Neff had ordered that any sentences imposed at state level run consecutively with the federal sentence.[5][3][41] As a result, Nassar will serve a minimum of 100 years in prison; each individual sentence would have been enough by itself to all but assure that he will die in prison.[4]  Nassar, Federal Bureau of Prisons Register #21504-040, was transferred to United States Penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona in February 2018.[42] Earlier, he had been transferred from a Michigan county jail to the federal detention center at FCI Milan near Milan, Michigan.  In August 2018, The Detroit News reported Nassar had been transferred to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma pending assignment to a new prison. According to his lawyers, Nassar was assaulted almost as soon as he was placed in general population at USP Tucson. An investigation subsequently determined that Nassar could not be safely held at Tucson, and needed to be transferred to a facility where it was safe for him to be housed in the general population.[43] In August 2018, he was moved to the United States Penitentiary, Coleman.[44] His earliest possible release from federal custody will be March 23, 2069, by which time he would be 105 years old; if he is still alive at that point, he will then begin his state sentences.  Aftermath  Following Nassar's conviction, more than 150 federal and state lawsuits have been filed against him, Michigan State University, the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, and the Twistars Gymnastics Club.[45] The entire 18-member board of USA Gymnastics (including Steve Penny) have tendered their resignations. MSU President Lou Anna Simon has resigned along with MSU Director of Athletics Mark Hollis. Additional people are also under scrutiny.[46] Nassar's crimes at Michigan State and USA Gymnastics have drawn comparisons to Jerry Sandusky's pedophilic activity at Penn State University.[47] In each case, mistakes were made when authorities ""turned the other way"" or tried to hide the activities of a child molester instead of immediately contacting law enforcement.[48][49]  Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette promised a full investigation into how Nassar was able to abuse young women for decades while working at the state's university.[50]  Michigan State University has agreed to pay $500 million to 332 alleged victims of Nassar, settling lawsuits filed by the victims. It's the largest amount of money in history settled by a university for a sexual abuse case.[51]  On July 18, 2018, more than 140 survivors of Nassar's abuse appeared on stage together at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California to receive the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at the 2018 ESPY Awards ceremony. Gymnasts Sara Klein and Aly Raisman and softball player Tiffany Thomas Lopez accepted on the survivors’ behalf and spoke. Klein identified herself as Nassar's first victim 30 years prior.[52][53] Lead detective Andrea Munford of the Michigan State Police, former assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis, and Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of the 30th circuit court in Ingham County, Michigan were identified. Aquilina was present at the ceremony. Singer MILCK performed her song ""Quiet”.[54] She was herself a victim of sexual abuse.[55]  In late July 2018, it was announced that Nassar would seek a new sentencing hearing due to concerns of perceived bias by Judge Aquilina.[56] His request was later denied by Judge Janice Cunningham.[57]",0
"Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston.  Welcome to You Know What I Heard, the Cut’s weekly celebrity gossip column about the peregrinations of the rich and famous. Have gossip? Email me at allie.jones@nymag.com, send me a message on Twitter, or contact me on Signal (ask for the number).  When Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their breakup last Thursday evening, they did so with a joint statement issued by Aniston’s longtime publicist, Stephen Huvane. It had Jen written all over it: The statement called out the malicious “gossip industry” and insisted that “whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative.”  Since Thursday, a lot has been printed about the split, and a lot of it seems to be coming from Theroux’s friends. So who’s really running this breakup?  Sources close to Theroux in New York have been telling “Page Six” that Theroux was “really bored by [Aniston’s] whole Hollywood crowd” and that he “initiated” the separation. Unfortunately for Aniston, Official Hollywood Bible People has more or less backed up those “Page Six” reports, citing sources who say that Theroux was done with the marriage and wanted to take the breakup public ASAP.  In one report, published Sunday, a source close to Aniston told People that “Jen didn’t want to announce [the split] for as long as possible, because she wanted to avoid the media attention.” But Theroux didn’t play ball. Instead, he walked around getting photographed in New York throughout Aniston’s birthday weekend, while Aniston celebrated at home with girlfriends in L.A. (We definitely noticed that last week.)  “Jen hoped that Justin would be low-key on her birthday so people weren’t wondering why he wasn’t with her, but that’s not Justin’s style,” People’s source said. “He wanted to make the announcement so he can live his life.” Theroux apparently flew to L.A. to talk to Aniston three days after her birthday (on Valentine’s Day!), and Aniston agreed to release a statement the next day.  So: Theroux initiated the breakup and took it public before Aniston was ready because … why? What life does he want to live? The Sun reported this weekend that one source of contention in his marriage to Aniston was his desire to “party” with the “New York art scene.” Specifically, Sun sources claimed that Aniston was upset over Theroux’s desire to hang out with 25-year-old photographer and “art beauty” Petra Collins.  👽👶🏼🌝🔪 A post shared by Petra Collins (@petrafcollins) on Jan 26, 2018 at 10:02am PST  The Sun tends to be more accurate when reporting on British stars (like Taylor Swift’s boyfriends), so who knows where its reporters are getting this information, but Theroux and Collins do know each other. Collins shot Theroux for a spread in L’uomo Vogue last year. The shoot took place at Paul’s Baby Grand in Tribeca; you can see it on Collins’s website.  Hypothetically, what would a Collins-Theroux romance mean for gossip? Collins isn’t just an indie darling; she’s also a collaborator and close friend of Selena Gomez. Gomez has publicly gushed, many times, about how much she loves Aniston. (They met a few years ago through their management.) Will Gomez have to pick a side?  Selena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston.  Another curious element in all of this: Aniston and Theroux may not be legally married at all. Though they had a surprise wedding in the back yard of Aniston’s Bel Air mansion in 2015, TMZ reported this weekend that the couple never filed for a marriage license, confidentially or otherwise, in L.A. County. And neither Aniston nor Theroux has hired a divorce lawyer.  Theroux’s friends may be talking to the tabloids, but Theroux himself is not ready to address the rumors: He backed out of a scheduled appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert tonight.  Selena Gomez, meanwhile, is reportedly in Jamaica with Justin Bieber for Bieber’s dad’s wedding. Jeremy Bieber, 42, is marrying his “longtime girlfriend” Chelsey Rebelo, 29. Here’s a photo of Gomez posing with some of Rebelo’s friends and relatives:  So Gomez and Bieber are going strong, despite her family’s disapproval. According to People, the on-again couple spent Valentine’s Day with a visit to Hillsong and a makeout at the Montage in Beverly Hills.  We haven’t heard much from Ben Affleck and his SNL-producer girlfriend Lindsay Shookus so far this year, but you’ll be happy to know they are still together and still color-coordinating their outfits.  Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus.  According to E! News, the couple spent Valentine’s Day house-hunting in L.A. “They visited two homes in the $8 million–$10 million range with a broker who gave them tours,” a source told the site. Those homes were in the tony neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, where Affleck’s ex-wife Jennifer Garner lives with their three kids. The house tours were very romantic, apparently.  “While Ben and Lindsay were waiting for the first house to be opened, Ben grabbed Lindsay on the doorstep and pulled her in close for a hug,” E!’s source said. “They were swaying back and forth hugging and laughing. He kissed her on the forehead. He walked with his arm around her and put his hand on her lower back. They seemed very happy and close.”  Shookus can’t be planning to move to L.A. full-time, though, can she? Her daughter and ex-husband live in New York. And she has SNL. Currently, she’s living in Affleck’s $28,000-a-month rental on the Upper West Side.  One small blessing from this week:  Here is a photo of Rooney Mara and her boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix going to a mall in Sherman Oaks.  Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara.  Jennifer Lawrence.  Finally, I’ll leave you with this TimesTalk Jennifer Lawrence did last week to promote her new spy thriller Red Sparrow. During the talk, she said she’d like to use her character’s skills to figure out “what’s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift.”  “That’s the God’s honest truth,” she added. “[It’s] keeping me up at night.”  Love or hate J.Law, she is a great gossip. Most celebrities pretend not to pay attention to the tabloids, but she regularly brings up feuds and rumors in public conversations. (See this appearance on Andy Cohen’s Watch What Happens Live! or her interview with Kim Kardashian West on Jimmy Kimmel’s show.) I, too, would love to know why Kloss and Swift broke up. This past weekend, Kloss attended the NBA All-Star Game with her boyfriend Josh Kushner. Before that, she was spotted hanging out with sworn-Swift-enemy Katy Perry. Swift has been hanging out with herself. Will J.Law’s comment prompt Swift to make a statement?  Thanks so much for gossiping this week.

"Stephen Colbert hosted a politically charged 69th Emmy Awards, which included big wins for ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""Veep"" and featured a surprise guest appearance from former White House press secretary Sean Spicer. (Published Monday, Sept. 18, 2017)  The 2017 Emmys belonged to ""The Handmaid's Tale.""  Alexis Bledel won the Outstanding Guest Actress award last week at the Creative Arts Emmys, and Sunday proved to be just as fruitful for her co-stars Ann Dowd and Elisabeth Moss, who won the awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, respectively. The acclaimed Hulu series, which began streaming on Hulu in May, received eight awards from 13 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series.  After the show, E! News' Zuri Hall caught up with the cast and crew backstage, where Moss (modeling a a Prabal Gurung dress) confessed she ""blacked out"" after beating the likes of Viola Davis (""How to Get Away With Murder""), Claire Foy (""The Crown""), Keri Russell (""The Americans""), Evan Rachel Wood (""Westworld"") and Robin Wright (""House of Cards"").  ""I really did. I don't really remember much of it. I've never experienced them actually calling my name, so it was a very strange feeling,"" said Moss, who received five nominations between 2009 and 2015 for her work on ""Mad Men."" Finally winning was an ""incredible"" feeling, she added. ""It's like an out of body experience — and then you immediately try to remember everybody you have to thank.""  Emmy Awards 2017 Winners    Fellow Emmy winner Donald Glover had the exact same reaction to his Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series as Moss did when she won. ""I blacked out,"" he told Hall as well. ""I was not ready for that.""  At the end of her acceptance speech, Moss thanked her mom, calling her a ""f---ing badass."" Since CBS censored her, is there anything else she wanted to say? ""No,"" she said. ""I crushed it!""  Moss then handed one of the two Emmys in her hands to Bledel, who called her own recognition at last week's ceremony ""amazing"" and ""so exciting."" More than anything, the actress said, ""I'm just so proud to get to do this work. To have an Emmy...I just can't believe it.""  © Copyright E! Online",0
"With the charts and pop radio heavily tilted toward rap at the moment, there’s so many recognizable artists in the mix for the rap Grammys that, beyond Lamar, the nominations are anyone’s guess.

"Hollywood speaks out against director James Toback after sexual harassment allegations  Celebrities have been quick to condemn the writer-director after he was accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women.  On Oct. 23, 2017, the Los Angeles Times published a report, claiming that screenwriter and director James Toback had sexually harassed at least 38 women (via The Washington Post). According to the exposé, Toback would often explain his Hollywood reputation to women he'd meet on the street, offering them a chance to be in his next film. Then, he'd allegedly bring them to his hotel room and ask them questions about their sex lives. Some of his accusers claim he'd then rub his groin against their legs or start masturbating in front of them.  Toback, 72, has denied these allegations, stating that he'd never met the women or, if he had, he couldn't remember their interactions because their meeting ""was for five minutes."" He also claimed that it'd be ""biologically impossible"" for him to have engaged in such behavior due to the medication he was taking for both diabetes and a heart condition.  It appears that many celebrities had heard rumors of Toback's alleged behavior over the years, and, as such, they wasted no time in slamming the Bugsy writer after the Los Angeles Times article was published.  ""The damn has broke. Women will no longer be silent. We have your back and will amplify,"" actress Debra Messing wrote.  ""One of the main jobs of a director is to create a safe environment for the actors. James Toback is a disgrace,"" Bridesmaids director Paul Feig tweeted.  Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn penned a lengthy Facebook post, describing how he personally knew at least 15 women that Toback had harassed or assaulted. Enraged at Toback's alleged behavior, Gunn wrote, ""For over twenty years now, I've been bringing up James Toback every chance I could in groups of people. I couldn't stop him, but I could warn people about him.""  ""James Toback damn you for stealing, damn you for traumatizing,"" Charmed star Rose McGowan wrote.  ""So proud of my sisters for bringing down yet another pig: James Toback,"" xXx actress Asia Argento tweeted out.  As Nicki Swift previously reported, McGowan and Argento have recently come out about the alleged sexual harassment and assault they were victims to at the hands of movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces accusations of sexual misconduct by dozens of women in the entertainment industry. After Weinstein's alleged behavior was exposed by both The New York Times and The New Yorker, he was fired from his position at The Weinstein Company, was left by his wife, Georgina Chapman, and became the subject of investigations by the NYPD, the LAPD, and London police.  Only time will tell if Toback faces similar consequences.",0
"Even if you’re world famous, there’s nothing better than love—and that’s just what these two have.  Justin Theroux took to Instagram today to ever so subtly pay homage to his superstar wife of two years, Jennifer Aniston, on the couple’s second anniversary. The intimate image shows the 45-year-old at a profile while his 48-year-old lady love kisses him on the cheek. It’s tender without being overly sappy. It’s the image of a husband and wife showing each other affection.  The photo had a simple caption (because a picture is worth a thousand words), which consisted of a heart emoji and a peace sign emoji, likely a reference to their two years together.",0

"Dawson Wade Leery is the central character from the WB television drama Dawson's Creek, portrayed by James Van Der Beek, and appeared in 122 episodes and cameo in Scary Movie (2000).  Fictional biography [ edit ]  Background [ edit ]  Dawson is the first child and only son of Mitch Leery and his college sweetheart, Gail Leery. He was born on March 14, 1983. His three best friends are Joey Potter, the girl across the creek, whom he considers his soulmate, Pacey Witter, Capeside High's class clown, and Jen Lindley, the new girl in town. Dawson is joined by a sister, Lily, who is born when he is 18.  Season 1 [ edit ]  An eternal optimist (at least originally), Dawson believes in the good old fashioned values of romance and honesty, and he also believes that you can find all of life's answers in a Steven Spielberg film. He was a keen filmmaker and made several low cost and amateur films, which were entered into film festivals across the country, and in some festivals his films won top prize. He and long-time friend Joey Potter spend much of their time together, often sleeping in Dawson's bed together. However, their relationship complicates as they age and especially with the arrival of New York exile Jen Lindley, who moves in next door to Dawson. He enters into his first relationship with her, but after her ex visits, she dumps him, insisting she needs time for herself.  After this, a series of events causes him to see lifelong friend Joey in a whole new light. First, his wise-cracking best friend Pacey Witter asks for Dawson's permission to ask Joey out. Dawson responds jealously. Later, he sees Joey looking sophisticated and mature for a Beauty Pageant, which opens his eyes to her beauty. Finally, he joins Joey on a birthday visit to her father in prison and tells Mike Potter all about the daughter he doesn't know. While Joey wrestles with the idea of spending a year in France, Dawson realizes that he can no longer hold back his romantic feelings towards her. The season ends with Dawson and Joey kissing in front of his bedroom window.  Season 2 [ edit ]  Although initially Dawson and Joey have smooth sailing, newcomer Jack McPhee comes to town and develops feelings for Joey, eventually kissing her. The kiss confuses Joey, who is struggling to find a passion in life. She dumps Dawson in an effort to find herself, but ends up quickly dating Jack. This sends Dawson back into the arms of Jen, who has been flirting with her old rebellious ways, and helps Dawson cut loose. All along, Dawson mopes over the loss of Joey, even making a movie recounting their breakup.  When Joey's relationship with Jack crumbles due to the revelation that he is homosexual, she comes literally crying to Dawson. For his sixteenth birthday, Dawson feels depressed that he hasn't grown and wasn't able to keep Joey, so he gets drunk with Andie McPhee. This results in him insulting nearly all of his friends, including Pacey, of whom Dawson is envious for his newly together life. Soon Dawson and Joey end up back together. However, their reconciliation is short-lived, as Dawson soon learns that Joey's father, who has gotten paroled from jail, is selling drugs again. Dawson urges Joey to wear a wire to bust her father. After this, Joey vows that she will never forgive Dawson for the position he put her in.  Season 3 [ edit ]  After a summer spent with his mom in Philadelphia, Dawson returns to Capeside still reeling from his split with Joey. On the bus ride home, he meets Eve, a mysterious, blonde femme fatale that seems intent upon luring Dawson with her sex appeal. After make out scenes in the janitor's closet and in front of the entire school at a pep rally, Eve convinces Dawson to go for a ride in his dad's boat. He does, but wrecks it on the way in and is told he must pay $3,000 to repair the damage to the dock he crashed into. Pacey then convinces Dawson to throw a stripper party at his parents' house to earn the money to pay for the dock. Although they successfully gather enough money, Mitch catches everyone leaving the house and Dawson knows he's in trouble.  In the meantime, Dawson finds Eve snooping around in Grams's house one night. Before he had realized that it was Eve he had called the police and it is Deputy Doug that turns up on the scene. He brushes it off afterwards, not wanting to get Eve in trouble. He later discovers an old photograph of a blonde lady in the house-boat that Eve has been living in, which he takes. Doug informs Dawson that the boat belongs to an elderly couple.  When Eve later comes for the photo he insists that Eve tell the truth. Eve reveals that she is adopted and that the woman in the picture is her biological mother and that she is searching for her. While helping Grams at her house, Dawson notices the same woman in a picture sitting on a nightstand. He asks who the woman is and Grams reveals that it's her daughter, Helen, Jen's mother. Dawson decides against telling Jen of his discovery. However, when Jen's mother visits her mother and her daughter at Thanksgiving Dawson confronts her, pretty much forcing her to tell Jen herself.  When Dawson, Pacey and Joey join Jack and his ex-girlfriend Kate at a party hosted by Matt Caufield, the entire group, except Joey, gets drunk. Dawson, fighting to have a life separate from Joey's, nearly kisses Kate. When Pacey's brother, Deputy Doug busts the party after finding Pacey lying in a tree, the group all end up spending the remainder of the evening behind bars. While Dawson tells Joey that she cannot be his keeper, Jack confesses to Kate that he's gay. Meanwhile, Mitch turns from friend to parent, and as a result of having to bail his son out of jail, enlists Dawson to help out at his mother's new restaurant.  After meeting a rival film-maker, Dawson realizes that he has let his desire to become a director overtake his life, and he decides to give it up for a period of time. He takes down all the posters in his room, and tries to cultivate other interests. During this tumultuous time, he realizes that the only thing in his life that has ever made sense is Joey, and determines to win her back.  Little does he know, however, that Joey and Pacey have been growing closer and eventually embark on a secret romance. When he discovers their relationship, Dawson reacts with anger, and cuts Pacey out of his life. He is more determined than ever to win Joey back. Joey and Dawson go together to the Prom, but when Dawson sees Joey sharing a dance with Pacey, he is enraged and demands Joey choose. Eventually he realizes that Joey wants to be with Pacey, and gives her his blessing. She leaves him on the pier, sobbing.  Between Season 3 & 4 Pacey and Joey spend a romantic yet tame summer on his newly renovated sailboat.  Season 4 [ edit ]  Dawson discovered in the previous season that his best friend, Pacey, has feelings for Joey. After saving Pacey and Jen from a storm at sea, Dawson is forced to white wash a fence for old-time film director A.I. Brooks, as punishment for putting a hole in his boat which Dawson was forced to take to rescue Pacey and Jen. Eventually, Mr. Brooks warms to Dawson and lets him film a documentary on him when he tells Dawson that he is dying of cancer.  In the meantime, he is confronted with the idea of Pacey and Joey as a couple. While they experiment with sex during the class ski trip, Dawson must make a life-or-death decision about Mr. Brooks when he's admitted to the hospital in a coma involving his terminal illness and has requested that Dawson be the one to take him off life support. Dawson chooses to let him go. When Dawson asks Joey if she slept with Pacey during the ski trip, she lies, telling him that nothing happened.  During this season, Dawson strikes up a romance with Gretchen, Pacey's 21-year-old sister, who has arrived back to Capeside to take a break from college, or so everyone thinks, but she later reveals that she is there to recuperate from a miscarriage that took place during her previous semester. The baby's father was her ex-boyfriend, pig-headed Nick, whom Pacey admired at first. During the Leery Christmas Party, Dawson and Gretchen share a kiss, which ignites old feelings from his pre-teen years when he had a crush on her.  After his sister Lily's birth in May 2001, Dawson and Gretchen part ways and she returns to college, and he graduates from high school and heads off to USC to pursue his dream of becoming a film maker.  Season 5 [ edit ]  After graduating, he studied film at Southern California, but soon dropped out and moved to Boston to be with his friends and to be with Joey. Before Dawson can even get his parents approval for moving to Boston his father Mitch Leery is tragically killed in a car accident. This changes everything for Dawson. At first he blames himself but then he goes on to blame Joey and that puts all romantic possibilities for them out of the picture. Instead Dawson is reunited with his old girlfriend, Jen Lindley.  During their trip to the Hookset Film Festival in New Hampshire, Dawson loses his virginity to Jen. It is at this festival that Dawson wins first prize for his documentary about A.I. Brooks. There, Dawson meets Oliver Churchkirk, an aspiring film director from Boston Bay College who fancies himself the best in the business. After being asked to read his script, Dawson agrees to direct Oliver's first major film. He casts Joey's bubbly roommate Audrey Liddell as the female lead, and Oliver casts himself as heartbreaker, Gage. After several flubbed lines and mistakes, Dawson concludes that Oliver is not the right person for the role. He then asks Jen to bring in her cheating ex-boyfriend, Charlie Todd, to play the part. Charlie agrees when Jen tells him that he gets ""to make out with a really hot girl.""  In the meantime, while Dawson and Oliver journey to New Jersey for a meeting with a film agent, the rest of the gang takes to the beaches of Florida for spring break; Pacey is hit on by Norwegian singer Marion Raven while working on his relationship with Audrey, while as Dawson later discovers, Joey embarks on a spring fling with Charlie Todd. Following his heart, Dawson hijacks the car with Oliver and drives down to Florida to tell Joey that he loves her. To Dawson's disappointment, Pacey tells him that Joey is with Charlie.  When their film is finished, Dawson learns that Oliver set up to have the film screened by cast, crew and friends. When Dawson finally agrees, he discovers that Oliver also invited a film critic, Amy Lloyd, who writes for The Boston Weekly. Dawson, not knowing who she is, stumbles upon Amy in the midst of a nasty break-up and tells her that she is a ""sentimental drama queen with really crappy taste in movies."" Angry, Amy leaves, unwilling to review the movie. In order to get her back to the auditorium, Dawson makes out with Amy at a local coffee shop in order to prevent her ex-boyfriend from seeing her; it turns out the man she was trying to avoid was not her ex-boyfriend. After running into Amy at a movie theatre in Boston, Dawson's spends the night at Amy's house and the two make love. He spends the remainder of the next day with her as well.  After a misunderstanding with Joey, Dawson heads to the airport to fly to Los Angeles. Joey confronts him about the way things ended between them just days prior. The two kiss goodbye and Dawson departs for California.  Season 6 [ edit ]  After not talking all summer, Dawson has a one-night stand with Joey. The next morning Dawson receives a call from his girlfriend in L.A. leading him and Joey to fight. Dawson returns to California.  After breaking things off with Joey, Dawson reunites with Hollywood actress, Natasha; she is presumed to be a few years his senior. In the meantime, when Joey shows up to deliver food to the movie set at which Dawson works, Natasha, drunk and angry, explodes on Joey; subsequently, the director, Todd Carr, fires Dawson. Realizing she made a mistake, Natasha helps Dawson get his job back.  Dawson pays a visit to Audrey in rehab, earning her dish duty for the night, after stalking one-time film director Toni Stark. He returns to L.A. only to discover that Todd, his new mentor and friend, is in disagreements with the film company that is paying him to make the movie, ""Wicked Dead"". While Todd quickly decides to discard Natasha from the leading role, Dawson convinces him otherwise. Dawson directs the re-shoots of the movie, but even so, the movie flops, going to straight to cable TV.  After realizing they have tickets for the wrong night of a No Doubt Concert in Worcester, Natasha uses her ""assets"" to get herself and Dawson admittance into the venue. When this fails, Dawson shows off his newly-won $600, hoping someone will trade tickets with him. However, this only attracts an on-duty police officer who takes the duo to a nearby station. They are let go with a warning from the authorities.  After a few months and some white lies, Dawson assumes that Natasha is having an affair with Todd. But his worries turn out to be all for nothing when two reveal their affair is a scam, and they were simply messing with Dawson. Natasha and Dawson reunite and he brings her to Capeside for Christmas. Knowing that she cheated on him with a fellow actor (Max Winter), Dawson questions Natasha's intentions, to which she becomes angry. Realizing that he's not in love with Natasha, he breaks up with her, and the two part on good terms as Natasha returns to Hollywood.  Meanwhile, Dawson's relationship with Pacey is better than it has been since the triangle began in the third season. Trusting Pacey to make his film savings grow, Dawson puts all the money he earned into a stock Pacey recommends. However, the stock falls through and both Dawson and Pacey are left with nothing. As a result, the two, once again, vow to no longer be friends. Joey, who is always caught in the middle, tries her best to reunite her friends. Pacey gives Dawson all the money he'd collected (but not all that was owed). Dawson concedes that there may be hope for the two of them.  With Audrey playing the role of Ms. Jacobs, Harley as Joey and her boyfriend Patrick as the girl-crazed 15-year-old Pacey, Dawson, with Joey's and Todd's help, begins filming his life story, adapted for the big screen.  Series finale [ edit ]  In 2008, Dawson is the executive producer and chief writer of the television program The Creek, a self-referential coming-of-age teen drama based on his adolescence in Capeside. While a young blonde boy portrays Dawson himself under the name ""Colby"", his two best friends appear as the neurotic ""Sam"" and heartbreaker ""Petey."" Returning to Capeside, Dawson learns that Jen is dying. Dawson helps Jen leave a video message for her young daughter Amy, and he and Joey reconcile their past agreeing that they are meant to be best friends and nothing more.  Kevin Williamson discussed the original ending of Dawson's Creek, stating the pairing was meant to be Joey and Dawson, but the two showed to be better as friends. The series ends with Dawson in his office who receives a call from Pacey and Joey, congratulating him on the season finale episode of The Creek. Dawson tells them that he's going to meet with somebody tomorrow, whom Pacey and Joey are able to guess is Steven Spielberg, Dawson's idol.  Notable relationships [ edit ]",0
"“Grey’s Anatomy” stars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew are leaving the ABC drama, Variety has confirmed. The two actors will depart at the end of the show’s current and 14th season.  “The characters of Arizona and April are permanently woven into the fabric of Grey’s Anatomy thanks to the extraordinary work of Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew,” said executive producer Krista Vernof. “As writers, our job is to follow the stories where they want to go and sometimes that means saying goodbye to characters we love. It has been a joy and a privilege to work with these phenomenally talented actresses.”  “It’s always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters,” said executive producer Shonda Rhimes. “Both Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic — both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV. I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performance and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family.”  Capshaw and Drew’s departures follow the signing of series star Ellen Pompeo to a lucrative deal that will keep her with the drama franchise and pay her as much as $20 million per season. Rhimes last year signed an overall deal with Netflix worth $100 million, that takes her away from her longtime home at ABC Studios, which produces “Grey’s Anatomy.”  Deadline first reported the departures.",0
"Mac Miller is finally sharing how he felt when his ex-girlfriend Ariana Grande got engaged to Pete Davidson.  The ""Missed Calls"" rapper and Grande split back in May after about two years together. By late June, the ""Saturday Night Live"" star had confirmed his engagement to Grande during an interview with late-night host Jimmy Fallon.  Miller, 26, admitted that the situation was ""strange.""  ""Like the whole thing is a little strange, but it's not negative. It's just a part of something that's going to continue to help make me who I am,"" the rapper told Zane Lowe on Apple Music's Beats 1. ""It's all positive energy. I am happy for her in moving forward with her life, just as I'm sure she is with me.""  Scott Dudelson/Getty Images  Miller said that his failed love story is ""not that unique.""  He added, ""I was in love with somebody. We were together for two years. We worked through good times, bad times, stress and everything else. And then it came to an end and we both moved on. And it's that simple, you know?""  Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  The rapper said he purposely stayed away from social media -- but not because of the breakup. Instead, he wanted to focus on his highly-anticipated forthcoming album, ""Swimming,"" out Aug. 3. He said the timing of his not being on the internet as much and Grande's engagement have sparked worried comments.  ""I haven't been on the internet,"" he said. ""So, you know, people have assumed that I'm ... 'Are you OK? Is everything OK?'""  ""Because I was about to drop the album,"" he said. ""I don't know, it just all seemed kind of unimportant, the need to show people I was OK. Like, what is that? Where does that come from? Why? Why do we have this need to use social media and the internet?""",0
"Harvey Weinstein’s attorney blasted Asia Argento for “hypocrisy” on Monday, following a report that she had settled a sexual abuse claim brought by actor James Bennett.  Argento was one of Weinstein’s initial accusers, telling the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow that he forcibly performed oral sex on her 20 years ago. Argento has also been at the forefront of the movement to hold Hollywood’s sexual abusers to account.  Weinstein’s criminal attorney, Ben Brafman, argued in a statement that the revelations about Argento undermine her claims against Weinstein.  “This development reveals a stunning level of hypocrisy by Asia Argento, one of the most vocal catalysts who sought to destroy Harvey Weinstein,” Brafman said. “What is perhaps most egregious, is the timing, which suggests that at the very same time Argento was working on her own secret settlement for the alleged sexual abuse of a minor, she was positioning herself at the forefront of those condemning Mr. Weinstein, despite the fact that her sexual relationship with Mr. Weinstein was between two consenting adults which lasted for more than four years. The sheer duplicity of her conduct is quite extraordinary and should demonstrate to everyone how poorly the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were actually vetted and accordingly, cause all of us to pause and allow due process to prevail, not condemnation by fundamental dishonesty.”  Argento has not sued Weinstein, and her allegations are not part of the criminal case against him. Weinstein faces up to life in prison if convicted on six charges of sexual assault and rape.  Argento was accused of having sex with Bennett at a hotel room in Marina del Rey, Calif., in 2013, when the actor was just 17 years old. According to the Times report, Argento agreed to pay $380,000 to settle the allegations.",0

"James Van Der Beek and his wife, Kimberly, are now a family of seven!  The actor took to Instagram to announce that he and his wife had welcomed baby no. 5 -- daughter Gwendolyn -- on Friday, June 15. The couple are already parents to three daughters, Olivia, 7, Annabel Leah, 4, and Emilia, 2, as well as son Joshua, 6.  ""Thrilled to announce we welcomed a brand new baby girl into the world Friday morning, just in time for #FathersDay 😍"" Van Der Beek wrote. ""These last few days, as I’ve enjoyed the privilege of making smoothies I know my older kids will like, making my wife red raspberry leaf tea to ease her uterine contractions, spending 'boy time' with my son and getting my two year-old down for a nap in the way only I know how... I’ve been heart sick about something.""  The former Dawson's Creek star then went on to criticize the Donald Trump Administration's crack down on illegal immigration with a zero-tolerance policy of separating families at the border.  ""As I write this, kids are being ripped from the arms of their parents. By our government. For the kid’s benefit? No - the opposite - as a purposeful display of cruelty to deter would-be illegal border crossers AND legal asylum seekers (it’s happening to both). And it wouldn’t be honest to wax poetic about my new-baby bliss without speaking up against this atrocity,"" Van Der Beek wrote.  He concluded with a sweet message to his wife, Kimberly.    ""Oh, and @vanderkimberly -- you’re a f*cking earth goddess rock star and I’m as in awe of you as I am in love with you,"" he wrote. ""And our new baby’s name is Gwendolyn ❤️ #HappyFathersDay everybody.""  The couple announced that they were expanding their brood back in February, with a sweet shot of the family crowded around Kimberly's baby bump.  ""Thrilled beyond belief to announce that we are once again adding to our family 😍,"" James captioned the pic. ""And I say 'beyond belief' because some people are probably wondering if we’re out of our minds. Which we might very well be... but I couldn’t be more excited. Or grateful. Or in awe of @vanderkimberly.""  However, the couple were also realistic about being way outnumbered by their growing family. Prior to welcoming their fifth child, James posted a pic of their kids on a sweet farm outing, with the knowing caption, ""In a few weeks, we’ll look back on today and think, 'Boy, wasn’t that easy?'""

"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.",1

"A little more than a month after the second season of Netflix’s Ozark was released, the drama series starring, directed and executive produced by Jason Bateman has been renewed for a 10-episode third season. Chris Mundy is set to return as executive producer and showrunner.  Ozark, created by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams, was one of the big breakouts of 2017, with its freshman season believed to be one of the most streamed shows of that summer. While the second season did not seem to match the buzz and outsized popularity of the first, Ozark remains a hit Netflix series that also gets steady awards recognition, making the Season 3 renewal a no-brainer.  In the current second season, Ozark, headlined by Bateman and Laura Linney, continues to follow Marty Byrde (Bateman) and his family as they navigate the murky waters of life within a dangerous drug cartel. With Del out, the crime syndicate sends their ruthless attorney Helen Pierce to town to shake things up just as the Byrdes are finally settling in. Marty and Wendy (Linney) struggle to balance their family interests amid the escalating dangers presented by their partnerships with the power-hungry Snells, the cartel and their new deputy, Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner), whose father Cade has been released from prison. The stakes are even higher than before and the Byrdes soon realize they have to go all in before they can get out.  Bateman directed multiple episodes from the first and second season and serves as an executive producer along with Mundy, Dubuque and Williams. Ozark is produced by Bateman’s Aggregate Films in association with Media Rights Capital.",0
"Britney Spears has lived almost half of her life in the public spotlight. Ever since her debut album, “…Baby One More Time,” was released in January 1999, Britney hasn’t made a move without the paparazzi recording her every movement. The album became the biggest selling record ever by a teenage artist and solidified Britney’s status as a superstar.  Britney back in the day:  [[contentId: 2002137| | size: 75]]  One of the most highly publicized events in Britney’ life is her brief marriage to back up dancer, Kevin Federline who she had only known for three months before marrying him on September 18, 2004. (They were not legally married until October 6 after their prenuptial agreement was finalized.) Since Federline’s ex-girlfriend, actress Shar Jackson was pregnant with their second child at the time, Britney’s engagement and marriage to Federline was the subject of intense media scrutiny. While Federline waited for one woman to give birth to his baby, Britney announced in October 2004 she would be taking a career break to start a family with her new husband.  The newlyweds in 2004:  HOW DID THE BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE RUMORS START?  In 2005, the couple signed a deal for a reality television series, “Britney and Kevin: Chaotic,” a five-episode series chronicling the couple’s relationship from their courtship and engagement to their wedding. The show aired on UPN from May 17 to June 14, 2005 and used footage that was shot during the European leg of Britney’s The Onyx Hotel Tour. Britney had originally intended to shoot backstage footage of the concert tour for a reality show called, “OnTourage” but had to scrap the tour after undergoing arthroscopic surgery following a knee injury while she was shooting a music video.  Britney said about the reality show, “From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids ran my life and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As I mentioned before, I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art.”  The tagline from the show was, “Can you handle our truth?”  The 5 episode series later came out on DVD:  The show was panned by critics who deemed the show as being too explicit and criticized Britney’s excessive narcissism. In the series, the pop star is seen talking about how the couple’s bedroom antics are “so good” and begs Kevin to let her take the day off “to just fuck all day.” She’s also seen quizzing her staff and crew about their sex lives and favorite sexual positions. During her pregnancy, Britney told reporters that her sex life was the best it had ever been since she conceived claiming, “I think it’s the best. Sex is crazy good.” Talk like this is generally what births and fuels sex tape rumors since the thought process is if the sex is that great, it must have been captured on video especially if the participants involved are celebrities.  A pregnant Britney with Federline. Now we get why they’re smiling:  IS THERE A BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE?  Rumors about a Britney and Kevin sex tape didn’t heat up until Us Weekly said in its October 17, 2005 “Hot Stuff” column that the couple watched “sex tape footage” with their lawyers and that the video was supposedly shot by a member of their entourage. Other rumors circulated that a member of Britney’s entourage copied one of the couple’s personal video tapes and a source reportedly told America’s Us Weekly magazine, “He has threatened to release raunchy footage of the two taken before Spears looked pregnant.”  Britney responded to the US Weekly story by filing a $10 million defamation lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court declaring in court documents that, “My husband and I have not filmed ourselves having sex. Therefore, we obviously did not bring any ‘sex tape’ to our lawyers’ offices for any reason, nor were we concerned that someone from our ‘entourage’ was threatening to release a tape since no ‘X-rated’ tape exists. The entire story is a complete fabrication. In fact, the first time that I heard about the alleged ‘sex tape‘ is when I first heard about the article.” Britney went on to say the report was “damaging” to her career and reputation particularly with her younger audience and pointed out that she had “repeatedly rejected substantial monetary offers to pose in photographs or appear in feature films with my breasts exposed.” Ultimately, a judge dismissed the suit on the grounds that since Britney has “put her modern sexuality squarely and profitably before the public eye,” that she can’t be defamed by rumors of any such alleged sex tape. However, the ruling did not address whether or not the story about a purported sex tape was true.  Guess this is what the judge meant:  Gossip about a sex tape only increased when in November 2006, two months after giving birth to her second child with Federline, Britney filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. Another rumor then emerged that Federline was shopping the alleged tape to the highest bidder and using it as leverage to get more money from the divorce proceedings. This was followed by another rumor suggesting Britney would leak the tape herself to prevent Federline from profiting. Britain’s News of the World offered Federline $50 million for the sex tape if it indeed existed.  Hoping to put an end to any and all sex tape rumors, the divorcing couple jointly released an official statement through their attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan. The statement said, “There is not a sex video of Kevin and Britney in existence. It goes without saying that the stories of Kevin attempting to sell such a video are patently false and anyone who reports that they have information of such attempts is either lying or reporting the lie of someone else.” The statement went on to say, “It would be impossible to comment upon and correct all of the other misinformation about Kevin that appears on a daily basis and consequently no attempt has been made, or will be made, to do so.” Britney and Federline’s divorce was finalized in July 2007 after the ex-couple reached a settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.  The short love story ends:  IS THERE A BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE WITH ANOTHER PERSON?  In February 2007, Britney became an unwitting star of a surveillance tape at a nightclub, One in New York City. The video reportedly shows the singer wearing fishnet stockings and a bikini while partying and eventually getting intimate with two female dancers who were fired after the manager of the club saw the video. The New York Daily News reported that a source said there were also pictures of Britney’s naked rear taken while she was trying on clothes with the dancers. The expectation was that it would leak to the internet however, the video still hasn’t surfaced.  Britney with her own dancers during a show:  In December 2007, Britney started dating celebrity photographer Adnan Ghalib who was her boyfriend during her very public mental breakdown at the beginning of 1998. By May, their relationship was over and rumors started that Ghalib wanted to sell a sex tape they had shot while they were on vacation in Mexico in January. Ghalib reportedly told British entertainment magazine, Heat, “There is such a tape. But I won’t discuss prices for hypothetical inquiries. Unless there is a locked-in deal, I will go no further. I am not interested in selling out any other details about Britney.” British newspaper The Sun said a source told them that the two-hour X-rated footage features the pop princess naked wearing just a pink wig. The insider alleges that “The video starts with Britney undressing. She was wearing some cheap clothes that she bought down there in Rosarito. The sex wasn’t particularly kinky but Britney wears a pink wig throughout. At one point in the tape Adnan asks that singer to remove the pink bob but she refused,” the source says. “Adnan tells her to take it off at one point and she says coyly, ‘Take what off? There’s nothing left to take off.’”  Although in October 2008, British tabloid Daily Star quoted a Spears family source as saying that Britney was planning to fight Ghalib in court over the sex tape, nothing materialized and neither has the alleged sex tape.  Britney and Ghalib before their break-up:  BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE SITE?  Although there is a Britney Spears sex tape site, there’s no sex tape available. The site is best for seeing upskirt or nip slip pictures of the singer and there is a nice selection of those since Britney has been known to have a few very public “off” moments. However, clicking on any link advertising a sex tape will only take you to a paid adult website. Also, unfortunately or fortunately, Britney’s All American looks can be copied by many American girls so an internet search will reveal several videos featuring girls claiming to be Britney. In reality, they’re just girls who resemble her. The most circulated video is one of a Britney look-a-like performing oral sex on someone who is supposedly Federline. There’s even one video on the net that claims to be Britney but you can’t even see the people’s faces in the footage.  The best thing for Britney Spears fans to do is to enjoy the various photographs and videos of the pop princess that is out there especially the ones of her in her heyday. Not shy in front of the camera and remember, a Superior Court judge ruled that Britney has no problem putting her modern sexuality before the public eye. So until a real Britney sex tape surfaces, fans will just have to be comforted by her the available modern sexuality that is out there and fortunately for them, there is plenty.  It was 18 year-old Britney’s idea to dress as a Catholic school girl for the video. See her evolution from this:  To this:  Britney was happy to pose nude even when she was pregnant:",1

But people who haven’t been a part of our day-to-day lives ask us ‘Wait, how did this happen?’ With this show, it gave me an opportunity to elaborate more than just saying ‘I’m an idiot.'”  Love at First Sight  While all Paradise fans know Iaconetti has been enamored with her boyfriend since she first laid eyes on him in 2015, what they might not know is that Haibon also immediately felt a deep connection to her pretty early on.  Admitting he was a little freaked out when he noticed Iaconetti frequently “staring” at him during the second season of BiP, Haibon — who thought she was “really hot” — only has fond memories of their first one-on-one date in Mexico.  “I remember just being so comfortable with you and how easily we got along … how the conversation just flowed,” he says on their episode of The Story of Us (produced by Married at First Sight and Seven Year Switch‘s Kinetic Content). “It never felt dull … or awkward.”  Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti  It was “truly love at first sight” for Iaconetti, however, who wasn’t able to fully be herself during the experience. “My interpretation of our first date is a little different. I was constantly scared of another girl coming in and catching your eye,” explains Iaconetti. “I was overthinking every little thing that came out of my mouth.”  Though Haibon “dumped” Iaconetti on the show, “I never felt like it was over between us after Paradise,” he says. “I’m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during BiP. It was a slow build for me.”  Flirty Friendship  After their first season of Paradise together, the couple built a strong friendship — but also became the definition of “it’s complicated.”  During a weekend spent in Virginia with their friends for a charity event Iaconetti was planning, Haibon saw her in a different light. “I was in love,” he says. “That was such a different experience being with someone in the show and in real life. You were just so down to earth and easy-going, ambitious … sexy. I wanted you that night.”  Adds Iaconetti: “I knew that he was looking at me!”  Though they frequently hung out several times throughout the fall and were “flirty” with each other, the timing just wasn’t right.

The duo met up in Boston at one point and “we made out real hard,” says Iaconetti. But shortly after, Haibon extended an L.A. trip to spend time with Iaconetti, and their relationship took a turn for the worse.  After going to dinner and a movie, Haibon spent the night at Iaconetti’s home. “You, like, kind of fell asleep in my bed. We kind of snuggled, but at this time I had to really force the snuggling,” she recalls. “This is when I knew something was wrong. And I don’t know what was wrong still.”  Looking back now, Haibon says he just wasn’t ready to be in a fully committed relationship. “Of course there were more-than-friendship feelings for me, but I felt like if there was any doubt in my head, that’s so unfair for me to be halfway in,” he says.  Paradise Part 2  With their mutual friends urging Iaconetti to move on from Haibon, the duo agreed to see other people for their second go on Paradise in 2016.  But Iaconetti “came in like a roller coaster,” recalls Haibon. “I’ll never forget that. It was really difficult … I was trying to tell you we weren’t gonna be together because I wanted you to move on [and] be happy.”  The drama continued after Mexico, and “we had so many arguments that summer when it was airing,” says Iaconetti. Those many fights helped them build a stronger bond, however, and “that kicked off a solid year of just friendship.”  Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti  Eventually, however, Haibon went into a “dark hole” and became “really withdrawn [and] almost resentful and angry,” says a tearful Iaconetti, who even had a “daybed” for Haibon when he would visit her in L.A.  Explains Haibon: “I think sometimes you imagine like you’re in this rainy day constantly and you just accept that as life. I’m like going after this other girl and we’re going on dates, and yet it’s so much easier with you. I knew that if you and I were to ever date … there’s no going back. Even if I had a two percent doubt about our relationship, then I probably shouldn’t do it because I don’t want to risk losing you as a friend.”  Jared Professes His Love  Haibon eventually signed up to do Bachelor in Paradise Australia while Iaconetti gave love another shot on Bachelor Winter Games, where she met Kevin Wendt.  “I remember I was on a date with a girl in Paradise … and I was just sitting there and thinking, ‘God, I wish Ashley were here,'” recalls Haibon. “I just wanna hang out with Ashley.”  When he returned from Australia, the duo exchanged a few flirty texts, but then Iaconetti jetted off to Winter Games in late 2017.  “I remember I heard rumors that you might have met somebody, and I was sad,” says Haibon. “Sometimes I need a kick in the ass. That was a big kick in the ass.”  Over the holidays, the duo exchanged awkward pleasantries before heading to a formerly planned vacation to St. Lucia with her sister Lauren and Bachelor alums Tanner Tolbert and Jade Roper in January.  RELATED: The Bachelor’s Ashley Iaconetti on Kevin Wendt Split: He ‘Just Wasn’t My Forever Guy’  “Going into St. Lucia, I did a lot of self-reflection … trying to figure out what I want, what I should do, if I should do anything,” he says about weighing whether or not to tell Iaconetti about his feelings for her. “It’s so unfair for me to say anything. Ashley goes on a show, finds another guy and now I’m gonna say something? What kind of assh— does that?”  After opening up to their “fairy godfather” Tolbert, however, Haibon decided to come clean to Iaconetti. “Tanner loves the theatrics of everything,” says Haibon. “But he said something that really resonated with me. Tanner said ‘It’s more unfair to Ashley if you don’t say anything because you need to give her the opportunity to let her know how you feel and let her make up her own mind.’ I was like ‘Okay!'”  Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti  The morning before the group flew back to the States, Haibon finally opened up to Iaconetti about his feelings for her. “I left that conversation with him not just admitting that he was jealous but also he had feelings, and you kind of alluded to wanting to be with me,” says Iaconetti.  “I remember you said ‘I’m gonna keep dating [Kevin],'” says Haibon. “I knew that in the coming months, I would have to really show Ashley that I was very serious about this.”  He also took a page right out of a romantic comedy and planted a kiss on Iaconetti just as she was about to board her flight. “I remember thinking ‘I should really kiss her.’ I was scared to do it. Tanner was like ‘You should go kiss her,’ and I was like ‘Yup!'”  But even after sharing a romantic smooch at the airport, Iaconetti wanted to give her relationship with Wendt a fair shot. “I thought ‘Okay, well that’s everything I’ve ever wanted, but I’m definitely gonna continue dating this other guy,'” she says. “I do like him. He’s pursued me … he’s been all in the entire time and I deserve to pursue somebody else and for somebody else to pursue me after all this time.”  As Winter Games was airing, however, Iaconetti knew her relationship with Wendt was over. “I just knew in my heart at that point that it wasn’t right with Kevin. I ended the relationship because it had run its course, and then Jared was still there,” she says, adding that she didn’t cheat on her ex.  Their Fairy-Tale Ending  After Iaconetti and Wendt split in March, Haibon went all out to win over Iaconetti and poured his heart into an emotional love letter that took three days to write. “I was scream-crying basically alone in my apartment reading that just sobbing and sobbing,” says Iaconetti.  Since then, the couple have been going strong — and Haibon continues to woo his girlfriend.  Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Kinetic Content  “He’s written me other letters and filled my apartment with flowers. He tells me every day that he’s the luckiest man alive,” she says.  Adds Haibon: “I’m living proof that you should listen to your gut, and that it’s not too late. The person I wanted to be with most was right in front of my eyes.”  The Story of Us: Ashley I & Jared was executive produced by Chris Coelen, Paria Sadighi, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon.",0
"Naya Rivera refiled for divorce from husband Ryan Dorsey on Tuesday more than a week after she was arrested in West Virginia and charged with domestic battery, reports said.  Rivera cited irreconcilable differences in a court document obtained by TMZ. She also asked the court to prevent either party from receiving spousal support.  Rivera’s three-year marriage to Dorsey, 34, has hit rough patches over the years. The couple first began dating in 2010, but broke up when Rivera was filming for the popular TV show “Glee.” They got back together in 2014 and married three months after the 30-year-old actress broke off her engagement to rapper Big Sean.  Rivera previously filed for divorce in November 2016, but called it off in October.  In late November, Rivera was arrested when she allegedly struck Dorsey in the head and bottom lip while they were taking their 2-year-old son Josey on a walk, WSAZ reported.  Dorsey, 34, reportedly told police about the incident and showed them a cellphone video capturing the alleged assault.",0
"Milena Markovna ""Mila"" Kunis (; born August 14, 1983) is an American actress. In 1991, at the age of seven, she moved from Soviet Ukraine to the United States with her family. After being enrolled in acting classes as an after-school activity, she was soon discovered by an agent. She appeared in several television series and commercials, before acquiring her first significant role at age 14, playing Jackie Burkhart on the television series That '70s Show (1998–2006). Since 1999, she has voiced Meg Griffin on the animated series Family Guy.  Kunis' breakout film role came in 2008,[1][2] playing Rachel in the romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She gained further critical acclaim and accolades for her performance in the psychological thriller Black Swan (2010), for which she received the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress, and nominations for the SAG Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other major films include the neo-noir action film Max Payne (2008), the post-apocalyptic action film The Book of Eli (2010), the romantic comedy film Friends with Benefits (2011), the comedy film Ted (2012), the fantasy film Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) as the Wicked Witch of the West, and the comedy film Bad Moms (2016).  Early life  Milena Markovna Kunis was born on August 14, 1983 in Chernivtsi, Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union.[3] Her mother, Elvira, is a physics teacher who runs a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, is a mechanical engineer who works as a cab driver.[4] Kunis has an elder brother named Michael.[5][6] Her mother tongue and the common language within her family is Russian.[7] She stated in 2011 that her parents had ""amazing jobs"", and that she ""was very lucky"" and the family was ""not poor""; they had decided to leave the USSR because they saw ""no future"" there for Mila and her brother.[8] In 1991, when she was seven years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, with $250. ""That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in LA.""[8]  Kunis comes from a Jewish family and has cited antisemitism in the former Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15] She has stated that her parents ""raised [her] Jewish as much as they could"", although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union.[16][11] On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: ""I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States.""[17]  In Los Angeles, she attended Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School.[18] She used an on-set tutor for most of her high school years while filming That '70s Show.[19] She briefly attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES), but when that school proved to be insufficiently flexible about her acting commitments, she transferred to Fairfax High School,[20] from which she graduated in 2001.[14] She briefly attended UCLA and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.[5][21]  Career  1994–2000: Career beginnings and television work  At age nine, Kunis was enrolled by her father in acting classes after school at the Beverly Hills Studios, where she met Susan Curtis, who would become her manager.[22][23] On her first audition she landed the role for a Barbie commercial.[24] Shortly after, she did a commercial for the Lisa Frank product line.[25][26] Her first television roles took place in 1994, first appearing on Days of Our Lives,[27][28] and a few months later doing her first of two appearances on Baywatch.[29] She had a minor role on 7th Heaven[19] and supporting roles in Santa with Muscles, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, and the Angelina Jolie film Gia, as the young Gia Carangi.[5]  At the age of 10, Kunis auditioned for but failed to get the role of a Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly.[30] Instead, she was cast in the secondary role of a Mexican girl.[20] In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role.[23] That '70s Show ran for eight seasons.[31] She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.[32]  In 1999, Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert in the role of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy,[33] created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show.[34] When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.[34] MacFarlane added: ""What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, but there was something about Mila – something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work.""[35] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007.[36] She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as ""the scapegoat.""[37]  2001–2008: Transition to film  In 2001, she appeared in Get Over It opposite Kirsten Dunst. She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho. American Psycho 2 was poorly reviewed by critics,[38] and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film.[39] In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation Tony n' Tina's Wedding. Although the film was shot in 2004, it did not have a theatrical release until 2007.[40] Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes.[41] DVD talk concluded that ""fans would be much better off pretending the movie never happened in the first place"".[42]  In 2005, Kunis co-starred with Jon Heder in Moving McAllister, which was not released theatrically until 2007.[43] The film received generally poor reviews and had a limited two-week run in theaters.[44][45] She followed up with After Sex starring alongside Zoe Saldana, who had also appeared in Get Over It.[46] In October 2006, she began filming Boot Camp (originally titled Straight Edge).[47] The film was not released in theatres in the United States, but was released on DVD on August 25, 2009.[48]  Max Payne premiere in 2008 Kunis at thepremiere in 2008  Kunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, co-produced by Judd Apatow. The role, which she won after unsuccessfully auditioning for Knocked Up,[2] entailed improvisation on her part.[49] The film garnered positive reviews,[50] and was a commercial success, grossing $105 million worldwide.[51] Kunis's performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal praised her ""fresh beauty and focused energy"",[52] while James Berardinelli wrote that she is ""adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing"".[53] She was nominated for a Teen Choice Award.[54] In an interview, Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from That '70s Show.[2]  Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, alongside Mark Wahlberg in the action film Max Payne, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role.[55] Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85 million worldwide[56] but was poorly reviewed by critics,[57] with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast.[58][59] Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was ""horribly miscast as some sort of undersized, warble-voiced crime boss"".[60] Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, ""Mila just bowled us over..... She wasn't an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park.""[55] She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film.[61]  2009–2012: Film breakthrough and acclaim  In 2009, she appeared in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews,[62] and grossed $10.8 million at the box office.[63] Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis ""brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility.""[64] Director Mike Judge commented that part of what was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: ""As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world.""[65] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: ""I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic."" Kunis herself stated that ""I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting.""[66]  In 2010, she starred alongside Denzel Washington in the action film The Book of Eli. Although the film received mixed reviews,[67] it performed well at the box office, grossing over $157 million worldwide.[68] Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kunis's performance, calling it a ""particularly strong piece of work"".[69] Several other reviews were equally positive, including that of Pete Hammond of Boxoffice magazine, who wrote that she's ""ideally cast in the key female role""[70] Even reviewers who didn't necessarily like the film complimented her performance, such as James Berardinelli, who wrote that ""the demands of the role prove to be within her range, which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts"",[71] and Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, who wrote that she ""generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character, developing an independent female character who's not always in need of rescuing.""[72] Other critics, such as Claudia Puig of USA Today felt she was miscast, noting that ""she looked as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial"".[73][74][75] Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance.[76][77] Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film Date Night, starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell.[78] She garnered several positive reviews for her performance.[79][80][81] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it ""a shot in the arm.""[82]  Kunis was nominated for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film Black Swan. She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and on the recommendation of co-star and close friend Natalie Portman.[30][83] She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20 pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week.[1][84][85] During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder.[86] Black Swan received widespread acclaim from critics[87] and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.[88] The film grossed over $106.9 million in the United States and Canada[89] while grossing over $329 million worldwide.[90] Reviews of Kunis's performance were positive,[91][92][93] with Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stating, ""Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but a smirk of self-assurance in place of Portman's wide-eyed fearfulness.""[94] Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, ""it's the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we're as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness.""[95] Kunis's performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival,[96] and earned her Golden Globe Award[97] and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress.[98] At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance.[99]  Kunis was cast alongside Justin Timberlake in the 2011 romantic comedy Friends with Benefits.[100] Director Will Gluck stated that he wrote the story with Kunis and Timberlake in mind.[101] Friends with Benefits achieved success at the box office, grossing over $149 million worldwide,[102] and received mostly positive reviews with critics praising the chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake.[103] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that ""Ms. Kunis is fast proving that she's a gift that keeps giving to mainstream romantic comedy"" and ""her energy is so invigorating and expansive and her presence so vibrant that she fills the screen"".[104]  In 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in Ted, her most commercially successful film to date. The film was directed and co-written by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg's character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis too young for the role. However, the film remained in development for several years and when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her.[105] Ted has received generally positive reviews from critics[106] and was a commercial success, grossing $549 million worldwide.[107] Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Kunis ""brings some lovely subtle grace notes to a role that easily could have just been 'the pushy girlfriend'"".[108]  2013–present: continued work  In 2013, Kunis played Theodora, the youngest of three witches, opposite James Franco, in the Walt Disney Pictures' prequel, Oz the Great and Powerful.[109][110] She dedicated her performance in the film to Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film.[111] The film, and Kunis's performance, received mixed reviews from critics.[112] Kim Newman of Empire Magazine wrote that Kunis ""walks away with the honours as the wavering witch Theodora, whose heartbreak brings another, less-expected depth to this 3D spectacle"".[113] In contrast, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter found Kunis's performance to be uncertain as her character seemed to be in a state of limbo.[114] Oz the Great and Powerful was a commercial success, grossing over $493 million worldwide.[115]  Also in 2013 Kunis co-starred in the crime thriller Blood Ties with Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, and Marion Cotillard.[116] The film premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and had a limited release in the United States in 2014.[117] Blood Ties received mixed reviews.[118] Kunis was also cast in the comedy The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, alongside Robin Williams and Peter Dinklage.[119] The film had a limited theatrical and VOD release[120] and received poor reviews.[121] The Paul Haggis-directed film Third Person co-starring with Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde and James Franco[122] premiered at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival[123] and had a limited release in 2014, but also received mostly negative reviews.[124] Kunis' performance was praised by some critics; Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her role gives her ""enormous room to express her talent"" and she ""gives her story a shot of raw intensity"".[125]  Kunis is set to be an executive producer for a feminist-themed TV series for the CW network. Meridian Hills, is a drama about the women's liberation movement in the 1970s. She will not appear on-screen.[126][127][128] In October 2014 it was announced Kunis, along with her partners, had launched a new production company called Orchard Farm Productions. The company has a first-look deal with ABC Studios, where the company is based. Under the agreement, the team will develop and produce TV projects for broadcast and cable.[129]  In 2015, Kunis co-starred with Channing Tatum in the science fiction film Jupiter Ascending, directed by the Wachowskis.[130][131] While the film grossed over $183.9 million on a $176 million budget,[132] it received mostly negative reviews, with a consensus that the production was ""narratively befuddled"" and a ""visually thrilling misfire"".[133]  Kunis co-starred with Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate in the comedy Bad Moms, which was released July 29, 2016.[134] It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and humor, though did not feel it could ""take full advantage of its assets"".[135] Chris Nashawaty from Entertainment Weekly wrote that ""Kunis manages to be both sympathetic and funny, and she has crack comedic timing"".[136] The film went on to earn more than $183.9 million with a budget of $20 million.[137] Following the financial success of Bad Moms, STX Entertainment reunited Kunis with her co-stars Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn for a sequel, A Bad Moms Christmas, which was released on November 1, 2017.[138][139] It went on to receive mixed reviews[140] and gross over 130 million worldwide with a budget of $28 million.[141]  Kunis later co-starred with Kate McKinnon in the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me.

The video was a parody of the MTV show The Hills and was a huge success for the website, with 2.4 million views over the next ten years.[143] Shawn Levy, director of Date Night, stated that part of what made him decide to cast Kunis with James Franco in the film was the chemistry he felt they had in the Funny or Die video.[144] In December 2008, Kunis was featured in Gap's ""Shine Your Own Star"" Christmas campaign.[145]  In 2010, she was featured in the ""Women We Love"" segment in Esquire with an accompanied video.[146] Kunis was among several female stars photographed by Canadian singer-songwriter Bryan Adams in conjunction with the Calvin Klein Collections for a feature titled American Women 2010, with the proceeds from the photographs donated to the NYC AIDS foundation.[147] During the summer of 2010 Kunis served with Randy Jackson as the Master of Ceremonies for the 9th Annual Chrysalis Foundation Benefit.

Your looks are going to die out, and then what's going to be left?""[17] Maxim has consistently ranked Kunis on its Hot 100 list, reaching a ranking of number 5 in both 2009 and 2011[155] and number 3 in 2012.[156][157] Esquire magazine named her 2012's Sexiest Woman Alive.[158] She ranked #2 on AskMen's list of Top 99 Women for 2013, behind only Jennifer Lawrence.[159] In 2013, she responded to those lists: ""All I can say is, I feel honored to be considered sexy.""[160]  Christian Dior signed Kunis in 2012 to be the face of its Spring fashion campaign.[161][162] In February 2013, she was named Gemfields global brand ambassador and the face of their advertising campaign.[163] Gemfields is a luxury company that produces emeralds, rubies, and amethysts.

(makers of Jim Beam bourbon).[167] After stating that she donates money to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's name she received praise but there were also calls for a boycott of Jim Beam.[168]  Personal life  On September 14, 2011, the FBI announced it was investigating the alleged hacking of Kunis's cellphone and email accounts, along with those of other celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson and Vanessa Hudgens.[169][170][171] Christopher Chaney from Jacksonville, Florida, later pleaded guilty in federal court to nine counts of computer hacking.[172]  In November 2011, Kunis was escorted by Sgt. Scott Moore to a United States Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina. Kunis had accepted Moore's invitation in July after he posted it as a YouTube video while serving with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, in Afghanistan's Helmand province. The event celebrated the Marine Corps' 236th anniversary.[173]  Kunis is a supporter of the Democratic Party and Barack Obama.[174] In a 2012 interview, she criticized the Republican Party, saying: ""The way that Republicans attack women is so offensive to me. And the way they talk about religion is offensive. I may not be a practicing Jew, but why we gotta talk about Jesus all the time?""[158]  Health  In January 2011, she revealed her struggle with chronic iritis that had caused temporary blindness in one eye. Some months earlier she had surgery that had corrected the problem.[175] Kunis also has heterochromia iridum, a condition in which the irises are different colors.

It's already more high profile than I want it to be.""[181] When asked if it was difficult to stay out of the tabloids and press, Kunis responded: ""I keep my personal life as personal as I physically, mentally, possibly can."" Asked if that is difficult she said, ""I don't care. I will go to my grave trying. It is hard, but I'll end up going to a bar that's a hole in the wall. I won't go to the 'it's-happening' place.""[182] On January 3, 2011, Kunis' publicist confirmed reports that Kunis and Culkin had ended their relationship, saying ""The split was amicable, and they remain close friends.""[177]  Kunis began dating her former That '70s Show co-star Ashton Kutcher in April 2012.[183][184] They became engaged in February 2014,[185] and married during the first weekend of July 2015 in Oak Glen, California.[186] The couple have two children: daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher (born October 2014)[187][188] and son Dimitri Portwood Kutcher (born November 2016).[189]  Filmography  Awards and nominations",0

"UPDATE: Woody Allen has clarified his comments on Harvey Weinstein after originally stating, “”The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved.” “When I said I felt sad for Harvey Weinstein, I thought it was clear the meaning was because he is a sad, sick man,” Allen said (Via Variety). “I was surprised it was treated differently. Lest there be any ambiguity, this statement clarifies my intention and feelings.”  Woody Allen addressed the “very sad” Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal in a new interview where the filmmaker admitted that he was unaware of the severity of the claims against the producer.  “No one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,” Allen told the BBC. “And they wouldn’t, because you are not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie. But you do hear a million fanciful rumors all the time. And some turn out to be true and some, many, are just stories about this actress or that actor.”  The director and the producer have a long business relationship: Allen-directed films like Mighty Aphrodite and Bullets Over Broadway were distributed through Weinstein’s Miramax, while The Weinstein Company co-produced Allen’s Vicki Christina Barcelona.  Mira Sorvino, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in Mighty Aphrodite, recently opened up about her own experience with Weinstein, an encounter that resulted in “many sleepless nights.”  “The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved,” Allen said. “Tragic for the poor women that were involved, sad for Harvey that [his] life is so messed up. There’s no winners in that, it’s just very, very sad and tragic for those poor women that had to go through that.”  Allen, who has similarly faced allegations of sexual abuse – including accusations levied by his son Ronan Farrow, who penned the New Yorker‘s expose into Weinstein – also voiced concern that the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal would result in “a witch hunt atmosphere” in Hollywood and beyond.  “You also don’t want it to lead to a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere, where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself. That’s not right either,” Allen said. “But sure, you hope that something like this could be transformed into a benefit for people rather than just a sad or tragic situation.”",0

"President Donald Trump‘s use of Twitter has long been a controversial component of his presidency, in part because of his frequent use of the “block” button, which the president has unleashed on a number of notable actors, authors and activists who have used Twitter as a platform to criticize him and his administration.  But his critics scored a victory on Wednesday when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that blocking his foes from viewing his tweets violates the First Amendment — because his Twitter feed is an official government account.  “Well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump,” model and author Chrissy Teigen, whom Trump blocked in July 2017, tweeted Wednesday after the judge’s ruling was announced.  According to The New York Times, seven Twitter users and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University sued the president, claiming Trump’s account is part of the government and blocking them violates their First Amendment rights.  Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald agreed with the plaintiffs, noting in her ruling that “the speech in which they seek to engage is protected by the First Amendment.” She also wrote that Trump and White House social media director Dan Scavino “exert governmental control over certain aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account.”  well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/WajEXiAQVi — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 23, 2018  Here’s a running list of notable people who have received the “@arealDonaldTrump blocked you” message on Twitter — but should be able to read his tweets again soon:  1. Laura Packard  Packard, a small business owner from Las Vegas who is currently battling stage four Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, was blocked by Trump after tweeting at him about health care and concerns over the repeal of Obamacare. The tweets that seemed to push Trump over the edge are from Sept. 19 of last year, in which she accused him of putting “America last,” and questioned him over the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill.  Don't you mean put America last? https://t.co/8tTxFjdYIw — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017  Your latest TrumpCare bill would mean 32M Americans will lose their health insurance. What about putting them first? https://t.co/wPObZisLQp — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017  Omg. The President of the United States just personally blocked me. pic.twitter.com/MgLfwufOXC — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 20, 2017  The morning of Sept. 20, she woke up and discovered that Trump had blocked her. Now, she has one request for Trump, she told ThinkProgress — and it isn’t that he’ll lift the block: “I just wish that he would listen.”  But Packard addressed Wednesday’s ruling, helpfully explaining how Trump can unblock users en masse.  Oh hai @realdonaldtrump! If you need to unblock thousands (tens of thousands?) of people in a hurry, perhaps due to court order, you can do it 1 by 1 but it's a lot easier to use https://t.co/HswTF8YZED and then do mass unblocking. — Laura Packard (@lpackard) May 23, 2018  2. Rosie O’Donnell  Trump and O’Donnell have been feuding for years, but it took until July 23, 2017, for him to finally block her on Twitter. It was a tweet that mentioned the instantly infamous unsubstantiated Russian dossier, which alleged that Russian spies had explicit information about Trump, which finally prompted him to block the former talk show host  on ur back ? dear god don – the russians bought their train ticket – u r confused -prostitutes peeed on ur back in moscow @realDonaldTrump — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 23, 2017  Just a few hours after sending the tweet, O’Donnell found herself blocked.  awww @realdonaldtrump – i get it – its too tough to read the truth … poor baby – i understand don – u take care of u – friend #BLOCKED pic.twitter.com/EQxnZarnhE — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 24, 2017  She’s still tweeting about him, though — and has asked others to forward along her messages.  3. Anne Rice  I've been blocked from Trump's twitter site. Hilarious. This after a few responses to his tweets! Wow. I'm amazed! Truly amazed. — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  Maybe I'll be personally attacked next. One can always hope. — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  And I so relished responding personally to Trump's tweets. Ah well… — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  The president denied the Interview With the Vampire author one of her favorite pastimes — personally responding to Trump’s many tweets. She frequently tweeted about the president, his policy decisions, and yes, his tweets. In fact, it’s almost all she tweets about even now, after she’s been blocked. It was a now-deleted tweet about the Republican health care plan that finally got her banned from his account on June 26.  Jeff Vespa/WireImage; Alex Wong/Getty  The tweet read:  “The Trump-GOP health care plan is a tax cut for the rich. Millions will lose coverage. A complete rip off.”  Now, like O’Donnell, Rice hopes that her messages will still find their way to Trump through her followers.  Already been smeared by the right. Please RT this to Trump. He's blocked me. https://t.co/jvnIKnJDsj — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) August 13, 2017  4. Chrissy Teigen  After 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him ""lol no one likes you"" was the straw pic.twitter.com/MhZ6bXT1Dp — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 25, 2017  The latest addition to the “blocked by Trump” club, Teigen is an outspoken critic of the president, and has been, in her own words, for “nine years” — long before he ever ran for the White House. What was the insult though, that pushed Trump to hit the block button? According to Teigen, it was her most recent attack, on Sunday:  Lolllllll no one likes you — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 23, 2017  Teigen shared a screenshot of the notification that Trump had blocked her, writing: “After 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him ‘lol no one likes you’ was the straw.”  Francois Mori/AP  5. Stephen King  Trump has blocked me from reading his tweets. I may have to kill myself. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 13, 2017  He’s an expert on twists and turns, but not even King could have predicted that the president would block him on Twitter. Before the block, in mid-June, King had frequently tweeted criticisms of Trump, but rarely tagged the president’s twitter accounts (@realDonaldTrump or @POTUS). However, there were some pretty tough-worded tweets, so it’s possible they ended up on Trump’s radar.  Donald Trump: A remarkable combination of unhinged and dumb as dirt. Time to start talking impeachment. Really. Enough is enough. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 10, 2017  Trump's tweets in his first hundred days draw a pretty clear portrait: he's an almost textbook case of narcissistic personality disorder. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 4, 2017  With President Forrest Trump, every day is like a rancid box of chocolates. You never know what kind of shit you're going to get next. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) April 11, 2017  6. Marina Sirtis  I've been blocked by our Prez !! — Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017  The actress and Star Trek: The Next Generation star can pinpoint her blockage to a single tweet. The whole thing happened pretty quickly. First, she tweeted this on May 8:  @realDonaldTrump threatening to go to WAR to deflect from Russiagate!! Willing to let our boys die to save his sorry ass! — Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017  Six minutes later, she tweeted that she had been blocked. Sometimes, these things happen fast.  7. Bess Kalb  OH. MY. EFFING. GOD.  The President of the United States just blocked me on Twitter because I hurt his feelings. #MAGA pic.twitter.com/oB5zTAs7In — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017  A writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The New Yorker, Kelb found herself blocked by the president after a posting a number of tweets about him, as well as regular responses to many of his tweets. She said she was blocked because she “hurt his feelings.” There’s no telling which of Kelb’s tweets was the final straw for Trump, but here are a number of guesses:  Trump is the funniest example of why you should always be nice to the makeup lady. — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017  The President of the United States of America just picked a twitter fight with Rosie O'Donnell. https://t.co/yYwVbq74Sh — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 11, 2017  Oh boy, honey. I've tried to lay off and let you President like you said you would, but this is a new kind of simplistic nonsense rhetoric. — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017  8. Andy Signore  INSANITY!! – The @POTUS @realdonaldtrump can't take my tweets criticizing his reign, so they BLOCKED me 😂😂 I have a theory about this (1of8) pic.twitter.com/KcW7JdFpd8 — Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 5, 2017  Signore is the mastermind behind the YouTube channel Honest Trailers. What’s surprising is that Signore wasn’t a habitual tweet-at-Trump-er. Instead, he wrote one critical tweet, about Trump misconstruing a quote by London Mayor Sadiq Khan on the terror attack at London Bridge.  I am so damn sick of bully @realDonaldTrump taking words out of context to act out his agenda of fear, corruption & bigotry. #NotMyPresident — Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 4, 2017  By the next night, he was blocked.  9. Angelo Carusone  Sigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now? pic.twitter.com/KBGG3YKfvf — Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) June 15, 2017  Trump’s blocking of Carusone, the president of the progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America, left him at a loss.  Carusone said he hadn’t tweeted at Trump in four months by the time the president blocked him on June 15.  “Sigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now?” Carusone wrote.  10. Holly Figueroa O’Reilly  Who says Trump doesn't read our tweets? 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/SQ8mb06InR — Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 29, 2017  Songwriter O’Reilly, who was also one of the organizers of the #MarchForTruth calling for an independent probe into the Trump administration’s possible ties to the Russian government, found herself blocked by Trump at the end of May. She’s tweeted a number of insults at Trump, including the following:  Did you seriously use your 11-year-old son, Barron Trump, as a political shield? You are the biggest f'ing coward.#TuesdayThoughts pic.twitter.com/wswdoBTsM7 — Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) July 25, 2017  O’Reilly, however, isn’t taking Trump’s blockage lightly. She, along with six other blocked-by-Trump Twitter users, as well as the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, have sued Trump, saying that the blocking is “unconstitutional” and seeking to remove it, according to court documents.",1
"The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating.  The 28-year-old reality star began dating Devin in July of 2017, two months after ending her relationship with fiance Ben Higgins, whom she met on season 20 of The Bachelor.  Lauren and Devin met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show.  Splits: The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating; (pictured March)  'I don’t think I’ve shared before but I only met up with one person from the app and it was him,' the beauty wrote during an Instagram Q&A with fans in October 2017.  'We hung out for a while but more as friends but always got along really well.  'Fast forward two years later when I moved back to L.A. we hung out to catch up and things just kinda happened after that.' she explained.  The former flight attendant also said that her last relationship with Higgins made her more aware of walking down the aisle.  Beginnings: Lauren and Devin had met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show; (pictured August)  She told the fan: 'I’ve learned a lot of things in the last couple years and this is a big one. Marriage is such a special and sacred thing that should never be rushed.'  When asked if she planned on marrying Antin, the star gushed.  'I do see a future with him,' she said.  'But I want to be 1000 percent sure before I get engaged and even more sure before I get married. And for me that takes time.'  Time was not on Antin's side as the two have now gone separate ways.  'I’ve always been someone who maybe jumps into things a little too quickly and I fall really fast,' she told UsWeekly on August 6.  'And I always had this idea that I was going to be married by this age, kids, and this was going to be my plan … and now, I mean I’m almost 29 but I don’t really have a timestamp on anything anymore, which is nice.'",0
"The Jennifer Lopez-led NBC cop drama “Shades of Blue” will end after its upcoming third season, the network announced Wednesday.  The series, which stars Lopez and Ray Liotta, will premiere its 10-episode third season on Sunday, June 17 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. Lopez stars as NYPD detective Harlee Santos, while Liotta plays her boss, Lt. Matt Wozniak.  “I have enjoyed producing and starring in this beautifully complicated world and playing such an empowering yet flawed character – a woman, a detective, but, first and foremost, a mother,” Lopez said. “Now looking at it with a little distance, playing Harlee strengthened me and helped me grow into a more self-assured woman. It’s crazy how some parts permeate your soul and change you forever and for that I am grateful. We crafted a poetic three-season arc on how her journey ends, which is true redemption. The way only Harlee could have done it – the hard way, the road less traveled. I thank NBC and all the talented actors, writers, crew and producers for going on this journey with us!”  The cast also includes Drea de Matteo, Dayo Okeniyi, Vincent Laresca, Hampton Fluker, and Sarah Jeffery. Nick Wechsler is a recurring guest star. Showrunner Jack Orman and Lopez serve as executive producers along with Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, Benny Medina, Ryan Seacrest, and Nina Wass.  Related 'Second Act' Cast Raves About Working With Jennifer Lopez Film Review: Jennifer Lopez in 'Second Act'  Lopez will stay in the NBC fold despite the series ending, as she is a judge and executive producer on the competition series “World of Dance.” Lopez is also set to lead a live version of the musical “Bye Bye Birdie” for the network, but it was recently delayed until 2019 due to her busy schedule.  “This is one of our flagship shows and we’re excited to share the final chapter with viewers who will be on the edge of their seats discovering how Harlee’s story concludes,” said Pearlena Igbokwe, president of Universal Television. “It has been a supreme pleasure to work with executive producers Jennifer Lopez, Jack Orman, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, Benny Medina, Ryan Seacrest and Nina Wass.”  “Shades of Blue’s” 13-episode second season, which aired last spring, averaged a 0.8 rating in adults 18-49 and 4.3 million viewers per episode in the Nielsen Live+Same Day ratings. That rose to an average of a 1.4 and 7 million viewers after seven days of delayed viewing.  POPULAR VIDEO ON VARIETY",0

"Kim and Kourtney Kardashian's feud wages on.  The sisters seemingly haven't been able to see eye to eye in dramatic promos for season 15 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and in an exclusive new clip, things get even more heated.  After Kourtney held her ground on picking a time to shoot their family Christmas card, Kim called her ""the least exciting to look at"" -- pushing her older sister to the breaking point. Kourtney breaks down in an emotional phone call to Khloe, who just so happens to be sitting with Kim and their mom, Kris Jenner.  ""I'm not here to be mistreated by my f**king b**ch family,"" she cries. ""Kim saying that I'm the least interesting to look at -- who even speaks like that?""  ""You guys just have really different values than me. I choose to be a mother to my three kids. I am not here looking for another job. I already work enough, more than I would like to,"" Kourtney continues, as Kim gets out of her chair.  ""You don't do f**king sh*t!"" Kim yells, causing Khloe to get up and walk away, with Kim following her.  ""You would honestly think that we have more jobs, so work around our schedule,"" Kim yells. ""You do whatever the f**k you want to do and you don't do sh*t, so be accommodating to the people who actually do sh*t.""    That's when Kourtney takes it to the next level, calling Kim a ""very distraught, evil human being."" ""I'm not going to live my life around people that make me not feel good on a daily basis,"" she says.  ""Well, clearly you're going through something else, because you're acting like a f**king lunatic. So maybe deal with that,"" Kim shouts back, forcing Khloe and Kris to take Kourtney's side.    ""Oh my god, Kimberly. That's not OK to say,"" Khloe interrupts.  ""What I said was rude and I wasn't even being serious. I said I'm sorry for that, but you're the most entitled f**king person on the planet when you work the least,"" Kim continues.  But the fight isn't over! Watch below.  Kim can definitely dish it, as she's clapped back in several celebrity feuds over the past few years, with stars like Piers Morgan, Bette Midler, Lamar Odom and Taylor Swift. Watch below.

"Every breakup has its stages, but, for Chloë Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham —the now former celebrity couple whose on-again, off-again love saga is a film waiting to be written—it's easy to get stuck in the subtweet phase. Proving that romance, or the dissolution of it, is really no different for celebrities than it is for anyone else, the couple are currently in the throes of shading each other on social media. Or, at least, some people think that's the case. Let's take a look at the facts.  A few days after photos surfaced of Beckham kissing model Lexi Wood, when the rest of the world had presumed he was still dating Moretz, the pair made some interesting moves on Instagram. Moretz posted a screenshot to let the world know that she's listening to Cardi B 's ""Be Careful,"" perhaps the most revealing song on the rapper's recently released debut album Invasion of Privacy . In the song, which has become an anti-cheaters anthem of sorts, Cardi B addresses her fiancé Offset's infidelity and gives him an ultimatum. ""Poured out my whole heart to a piece of s**t,"" she raps, ""Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson..../ Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo/ And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives..../ Be careful with me/ Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'."" Moretz captioned the screenshot with two words: ""The queen.""  What's more, Moretz liked a meme posted by a fan account of her giving the middle finger with the caption ""Greetings to Brooklyn Beckham from me motherf***er,"" as Perez Hilton later pointed out.  Meanwhile, Beckham weighed in on the situation not with his own post, but instead by liking another meme that depicted him crying as a young boy next to his mother, Victoria Beckham with the caption ""Chloe's fans are attacking Brooklyn Beckham.""  Loading View on Instagram  But how did we get here? To recap, Moretz and Beckham first linked up in 2014 at Paris Fashion Week. They didn't officially enter into a public-facing relationship, though, until April 2016. Not long after, they called off their relationship once again, this time citing the long distance between them. (Beckham was living in London, while Moretz was Stateside.) She later talked about that breakup , saying that she just wanted to hide. “They were like, 'That’s all great that you want to go away—but you can’t. You are your own person,'"" she said. ""'You’re going to have to deal with this sort of thing.’ I felt like things were falling apart, like my head and heart weren’t in the same place. Things started to change when I realized I have the power within to change them.” With that knowledge, hopefully this ending will be easier on the couple.",0

"The 2018 Golden Globes, hosted by Seth Meyers, will be awarded on Sunday, January 8, with the ceremony airing live at 8 pm Eastern on NBC. (It will also be live-streamed online for the first time.)  The annual event, which honors performances in both television and film, is considered one of Hollywood’s most “fun” awards shows due to how early the awards fall in the season, the presence of alcohol (resulting in more celebrities letting loose), and general unpredictability about the winners. In other words, they’re usually a pretty good time, as far as three-hour awards shows go.  But this year’s event might take on a more somber tone, due to the recent wave of revelations regarding sexual harassment in the entertainment industry, and the rise of the #MeToo movement.  Many actors and actresses have promised to wear black to raise awareness of the movement and protest sexual harassment in Hollywood. And the marketing for the ceremony has implied that it will offer a platform for speaking out; one promo even features Meyers declaring, “Hollywood, we’ve got a lot to talk about.”  When it comes to the awards themselves, the film frontrunner appears to be The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro’s grown-up fairy tale about a mute woman and a fish-man, which leads the nominations with seven. Steven Spielberg’s The Post and Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri follow, with six nominations each.  In the TV categories, HBO’s Big Little Lies leads the pack with six nods. Feud: Bette and Joan has four, while The Handmaid’s Tale, This Is Us, and Fargo each have three nominations.

The pair flew to St Barts this week along with Scott's kids, Mason, eight, Penelope, five, and Reign, three.  While Sofia holidaying with the kids is a sure enough sign that the loved-up pair are more serious than ever, Scott also proudly shared a candid snap of his 19-year-old girlfriend massaging his feet on Sunday.  The picture shows Lionel Richie's daughter, who has been dating Scott since last summer, sitting in front of him rubbing his feet as he lays down, with the ocean spread out in front of them.  (Image: Instagram/letthelordbewithyou)  ""Could be worse,"" the 35-year-old captioned the picture.  Their pet pooch also makes a starring role in the snap.  The previous day Sofia publicly professed her love for her boyfriend while wishing him a happy birthday on Instagram.  While she usually keeps their romance on the down-low when it comes to social media, she proudly shared a snap of them cuddling up alongside the sweet message: ""Happy Birthday babe! Thank you for being you. Love you.""  (Image: Instagram/sofiarichie)  With a 16 year age gap, many thought their relationship wouldn't last - but these recent posts appear to prove the pair are stronger than ever.  Dad-of-three Scott also received a handful of social media messages from the Kardashians on his big day.  Khloe, who recently welcomed daughter True Thompson, posted four vintage snaps of her and Scott, including one of her slapping him across the face.  ""We came a long way. Remember when I slapped you?"" Khloe jokingly captioned it.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: Getty Images North America)  Kim also shared a series of funny pictures of the pair of them together over the years.  One showed a US magazine cover that claimed Scott was 'in love' with Kim, while another showed the birthday boy playing third wheel as the reality star walked hand-in-hand with husband Kanye West.  Scott himself uploaded pictures of him and his three kids, including an adorable snap of daughter Penelope who laid out dozens of flowers to spell 'dad'.",0

"Determine your pores and skin kind, first.  “Figuring out what sort of pores and skin and breakouts you will have, determines what merchandise it’s best to use and how one can precisely deal with the zits. It is at all times useful to get knowledgeable opinion from aestheticians and dermatologists to create a recreation plan for your pores and skin.”  Bear in mind: It is solely non permanent.  “Once I really feel self-conscious about my pores and skin, I actually simply attempt to remind myself that the breakout is non permanent. I am fascinated about my breakout 1000x greater than anybody else is—the folks round me will not be targeted on my breakout, my paranoia about my pores and skin amplifies the severity of a breakout tremendously and it is often not as unhealthy as I believe.”  Put money into facials.  “I did not begin getting facials till I used to be in my late teenagers—and so they had been extremely costly,” she stated.  By means of her collaboration with Dermalogica, the actress is making facials reasonably priced and accessible with a brand new skin-care initiative: FaceFit, out there on August 4th.  “[FaceFit is] an reasonably priced and simply accessible approach for anybody to get knowledgeable high quality facial. It is a $10, 10-minute facial, given by a Dermalogica pores and skin therapist that can be out there for a restricted time in ULTA Magnificence and Dermalogica shops. This can be a service that I want I had once I was youthful.”  Say no to quick meals.  “I have been much more aware about what I have been consuming… and it has had a direct impact on my pores and skin. I’ve lower out quick meals and soda inside the previous month and my brow breakouts have gotten much less frequent.”  Don’t put drying lotion on whiteheads.  “Somewhat tip I’ve realized in speaking with aestheticians is that you just should not put drying lotion on whiteheads—that truly makes the pimple stick round longer. A serum or spot therapy with salicylic acid helps with larger, cystic pimples.”  Her go-to product: “The Breakout Clearing Booster is formulated with salicylic acid which helps kill breakout-causing micro organism with out drying the pores and skin. It may be used as a spot therapy and likewise as a serum. It may be worn beneath make-up as properly—it is like a protecting defend between your breakouts and different merchandise.”",0
"Queer Eye Sky’s the Limit Season 2 Episode 5 Editor’s Rating 5 stars * * * * * « Previous Next »  I know that Queer Eye is always going to make me cry, but when this episode started, I didn’t think that I was going to be this shocked. I wasn’t sure what I was watching, but I knew it was riveting. I knew that it had the potential to change the entire series as we’ve known it so far. Yes, at the beginning of the episode, Karamo was not wearing a satin bomber jacket. It was actually a knit. Like a sweater. Sure, it still zipped up the front so it wasn’t so far from his usual uniform, but still. I didn’t quite know what to do with myself.  While that shocked me, the real shock was watching this episode’s makeover subject, Skyler, getting his top surgery. We see Skyler wake up and look down at his chest, which used to have breasts, and see it flat and masculine as he always wanted it to be and his face erupts with emotion. It was really and truly moving way to begin the episode.  The other shocking thing is that redheads are bad with anesthesia. Who knew this was a real thing? I certainly didn’t. It’s such a shame that Skyler not only had to spend $8,000 of his own money to have the surgery, but will now face thousands of dollars of medical bills because of the complications just from being a redhead.  As hard as being a ginge is, being trans is even harder. Many people know the struggle of being transgender in our society, but what really struck me about this episode was how even the silly everyday things that so many of us take for granted can be triggering for a trans person. I never would have thought that getting a suit tailored would lead to an emotional breakdown for Skyler because he felt uncomfortable with someone all up in his pants business. Or the fact that some bitch at the DMV could cause such emotional pain. I mean, we’ve all felt existential dread at the DMV, but this is a whole different level for Skyler.  I must say that trans people really are heroes. The strength it takes for them to be themselves every day is so hard, but they continue to soldier on when there is still so little support for them. It’s absolutely astonishing and brave. That said, it doesn’t mean that some of them don’t have truly awful style. Sorry, Skyler.  Skyler dresses in poorly fitting basketball jerseys, silly novelty hats, and the worst shoes I have ever seen on someone who isn’t named Mario Batali. He’s just so happy to be a boy that he’s dressing like a 19-year-old at a third-tier state school. His house is decorated like one too, with the raised bed and all of his crap underneath it. He tells us that he had to leave his parents’ house at 17 after he came out to them, and it’s like he’s living in this arrested ideal adolescence that he never got to enjoy.  Maybe I should cut him a bit more slack, but this guy has a couch that is literally called the “cat pee couch.” The only thing worse is all of the rainbow-flag Pride paraphernalia around the house. Ugh, I am a proud homosexual, but I hate that stupid rainbow flag. There is no way that you can make it look not tacky. No matter what you do with it, it still looks like a tourist in Key West wearing a fanny pack while on a break from a Princess Cruise. The rainbow flag and the fact that Christina Aguilera isn’t a bigger star are the twin scourges of the queer community.  Because this is a very different episode, we didn’t even get that much of a makeover. Instead, we mostly heard about Skyler’s story. And that was fine with me because, girl, did I sob. I sobbed when he got a license that says he is male, I sobbed when he tried on the first suit that really fit him well, and I sobbed when he got up onstage at his “coming-out party” and started stripping for the crowd and showing off the body he was so proud of.  I loved that Tan wanted Skyler to look good in a suit because, he’s right, every man’s body looks more masculine with some good tailoring. It was really sweet that he brought in his friend whose suiting company works a lot with the trans community and has a few easy tricks to make their suits fit their bodies more comfortably. However, I am pissed at Tan. How the hell does he not know who Todrick Hall is? Has he not watched Drag Race? The only thing I hate more than the rainbow flag is people who say, “We’re going to take your gay card away,” but I feel like Tan shouldn’t be allowed to film any more of these episodes at least until he’s watched All Stars 2.  Also, as soon as Skyler kept going on about his love of the YouTube star and Drag Race fixture, I thought, “If we leave this episode without a guest appearance from Mx. Hall, then these queens did not do their job.” Thankfully, they did not disappoint and Todrick showed up on Skyler’s doorstep for a teary tête-à-tête. It would have been very easy for Skyler to just fan out about Toddy’s videos and singles, but instead I was really touched by what he said about how Todrick really showed him how he can blend the feminine and masculine energies together to make something that is totally unique and wonderful. There are plenty out there who scoff at YouTube celebrities, but that is the power of the medium is harnessed correctly. (Speaking of harnessed correctly, I wouldn’t mind seeing Todrick Hall in a harness, if he’s taking requests for his next video.)  Meanwhile, Bobby got rid of the cat pee couch and made Skyler’s room look like a rec room at St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, but even that was a vast improvement. Antoni showed Skyler how to make poke and I will not make fun of Antoni in this recap because it was all so moving and lovely. Yes, I made this oath during an episode where he wears guyliner, so basically I’m deducting this recap on my taxes as a charitable donation.  Jonathan had the hardest job of all: He had to convince Skyler to trim his signature beard, which is what he thinks makes his face look the most masculine. But Jonathan was right, his bright-red beard was a bit too manicured, so it actually made his face look more feminine rather than the opposite. When Jonathan gave Skyler a haircut and a beard trim, he not only looked butcher but he also looked younger, which is a good look on anyone. Let’s face it: Being trans is hard enough, so the least that the Fab Five can do is give a trans man a good beard and rid his house of all of that ugly rainbow.",0

"It’s time to take a pen to “ Justin Theroux might be hooking up with Selena Gomez ” rumor and scratch out Selena’s name, and scribble in “ Emma Stone .” Because it would appear that Justin has moved his slick aging hipster sights onto a new target in her 20s.  This one comes out of the file marked “random, but I’m listening“. Radar reports that Justin Theroux is letting his fingers do the talking and the lady they’re talking to is Selena Gomez . According to Radar’s source, Justin has been flirtatiously texting Selena and has been crushing on her since before his split with Jennifer Aniston . I guess the message “snitches get stitches” never really took in Hollywood.  Hopefully 69-year-old Norman Resnicow has a product to plug or a business to shill. Because he’s getting all sorts of spotlight from his ongoing legal battle with his upstairs neighbor, desperate hipster/ dick jogger Justin Theroux . You see, Justin and Jennifer Aniston are about to legally become exes , and she’s highly famous, so everybody wants the dirty dirt. Norman’s got you, and he’s also got a lot of love for that nice Jen girl whom he occasionally rolled eyes with over Justin’s latest porkpie hat. Continue reading  Jennifer Aniston has said previously that she is so completely over the “JEN’S BABY JOY!” pregnancy rumor mill. So Jennifer might want to sit this story out, because it’s all about two things she’s not in to: speculation about her marriage to Justin Theroux, and speculation about the vacancy status of her uterus.  People continues to fill in the blanks about Jennifer’s sad, shattered, broken, tear-down of a heart. Or at least what their sources consider to be the missing pieces in the puzzle of their legally-questionable marriage. A source tells People that Jennifer was losing hope of being a mom, and then her gallant hero Sir Justin of Fertile Spermingham galloped into her life. But it didn’t go as planned.  “When Jen met Justin, she had almost given up on the idea that she would have kids,” a source close to Aniston tells People. “They wanted to have a baby, but it didn’t work out.”  The source claims that Jennifer and Justin started making baby plans shortly after they got engaged in 2012. After almost six years later, nothing happened. But the source says that Jennifer was “sad it never happened,” but adds that it never consumed her.  Jennifer is extremely rich, and when you’re rich you have a lot of options, so I’m sure she’d have a kid if she wanted one by now. But now I can’t help but picture what their baby would have looked like. All I know is that Justin looks like he’s got pretty dominant DNA, and no one should have been surprised if that baby popped out with a teeny-tiny cool dude chain necklace or an itty-bitty leather wrist cuff.

"Chad Michael Murray had never known the cause of death of his late grandmother — until now.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In fact, there were only two people who knew what exactly happened at the time of her death: his grandmother and her husband, his late grandfather, who was accused of her murder.  On Wednesday’s episode of Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry, Murray, 36, finally got some closure about her death.  “There’s this feeling that grandpa would’ve said or verbalized something to people before he died and after he died, his words were changed. He’s like, ‘No, I’m not taking accountability for this. This isn’t right.’ There’s something wrong here with the narrative that’s put after,” Tyler Henry, 22, told the One Tree Hill alum.  “For some reason, they’re having me talk about grandma. They’re having me talk about a fall for some reason. I don’t know what this is,” Henry explained.  “The speculation from the stories that I got from my grandfather was that he was arrested for her murder,” the actor said. “She died at 17 and she just had my mother. She was found with her hands tied behind her back, hung in the basement. So there was a fall, just in a different way.”  “And then after that, he was cleared and they didn’t really have enough evidence to say, ‘It was you that did it.’ ”  RELATED: Why Hollywood Medium‘s Tyler Henry Says Connecting with Michael Jackson Was ‘Really Humbling’  But according to Henry, Murray’s late grandmother died by suicide.  “Before I got here, there was this woman who came through who I acknowledged passing away tragically. But it came through in a way of like, taking accountability to some extent for her actions,” Henry informed the American Drifter author. “But I’m thinking that it might have been even her way of kinda trying to come through and say, ‘Hey, this is something that I’m putting more on myself.’ So, I don’t think he killed your grandmother.”  E!  After speaking with Henry and learning the details about his late grandmother’s death, Murray revealed, “I am, without a doubt, a believer,” adding, “He’s pretty damn good at it.”  Hollywood Medium airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on E!

"Hoda Kotb is a longtime news contributor and personality for NBC. In January 2018, she was named co-host of the opening hours of the network's flagship morning program, 'Today.'  Who Is Hoda Kotb?  Born in Oklahoma in 1964 to Egyptian parents, Hoda Kotb began her broadcasting career as a news assistant in 1986. She became a correspondent for Dateline NBC in 1998, carving out a strong reputation for her journalistic work, before earning a fan base for her lively personality as co-host of Today's 10 a.m. time slot. Taking over the higher-profile 7 and 8 a.m. hours after Matt Lauer was fired in November 2017, Kotb was formally named co-host of the show's opening hours, with Savannah Guthrie, in January 2018, making this the first time two females have hosted together in Today's history.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  'Today' Co-Host  On January 2, 2018, Hoda Kotb began the New Year with the announcement that she was officially taking over as co-host of the 7 and 8 a.m hours of NBC’s daily morning talk show Today, alongside Savannah Guthrie.  Kotb, the longtime co-host of Today’s 10 a.m. hour, had served as interim host of the opening hours since late November 2017, when previous anchor Matt Lauer was fired for inappropriate workplace behavior. Her pairing with Guthrie had proved a winning combination, as Today surpassed the ratings of the rival ABC program Good Morning America for four consecutive weeks, prompting Today execs to make the move permanent.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  'Dateline' to Kathie Lee Cohort  Prior to her ascension to the high-profile opening hours of Today, Kotb had been a valued member of NBC for nearly 20 years. She joined the network in 1998 as a correspondent for the newsmagazine Dateline NBC, and went on to cover some of the most important domestic and international events of the time, including the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. She also conducted exclusive interviews with notable figures such as Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and hosted the weekly syndicated series Your Total Health from 2004 to 2008.  Kotb began hosting the 10 a.m. hour of Today in September 2007, and the following spring was paired with veteran morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford in the slot. The two demonstrated an easy rapport as they sipped wine and riffed on issues of the day, sharing an Emmy win with the rest of the Today team in 2010.  Kotb also substituted for both Guthrie and Lauer on Today and stepped in for various network-related specials, including coverage of the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Egyptian Parents, American Upbringing  Hoda Kotb was born on August 9, 1964, in Norman, Oklahoma. The middle child of Egyptian immigrants who left Cairo to study at the University of Oklahoma, Kotb was raised in an English-speaking household, describing her assimilated parents as people who ""wanted us to be red, white and blue."" She spent her childhood in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia, save for a year abroad in Nigeria and extended vacations with family in Egypt.  After attending Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Kotb stayed close to home to attend Virginia Tech University. She became involved with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and WUVT, the student radio station, before earning her B.A. in broadcast journalism in 1986.  Early Career  Kotb immediately embarked on her broadcasting career after college, joining CBS in 1986 as a news assistant in her parents' hometown of Cairo. After that, she moved on to stints for CBS and ABC affiliates in Illinois, Mississippi and Florida, before settling in as a reporter and anchor for WWL-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1992 to 1998.  Breast Cancer Survivor  Kotb was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2007 after her gynecologist discovered lumps during a routine exam. Despite her years as host of Your Total Health, she had never undergone a mammogram.  Kotb opted to skip chemotherapy but underwent a mastectomy, a procedure that required an extensive mental and physical recuperation period. While keeping a journal of her recovery, she wrote the word ""forward"" at the end of each entry as a means of overcoming day-to-day difficulties and keeping faith in her progress.  After coming across a breast cancer walk in Central Park later that year, Kotb decided to go public with her story. Shortly after joining Today in 2007, she shared her experiences in an October episode as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  Awards and Other Endeavors  In 2007, Kotb was part of the Dateline team honored with a prestigious Peabody Award for The Education of Ms. Groves, a documentary chronicling the challenges facing a first-year teacher at an urban middle school in Atlanta, Georgia. She is also a recipient of the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award and four Gracie Awards, and has been nominated for numerous Emmys.  Along with her celebrated broadcasting work, Kotb in 2010 published her memoir, Hoda: How I Survived War Zones, Bad Hair, Cancer, and Kathie Lee. She has since written two more books, Ten Years Later: Six People Who Faced Adversity and Transformed Their Lives (2013) and Where They Belong: The Best Decisions That People Almost Never Made (2016) .  The TV personality has also pulled double duty as a radio host since launching The Hoda Show on SiriusXM in February 2015.  Personal  In 2005 Kotb married Burzis Kanga, the former tennis coach for the University of New Orleans, but they divorced two years later.

"Born in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé Knowles first captured the public's eye as lead vocalist of the R&B group Destiny's Child. She later established a solo career with her debut album Dangerously in Love, becoming one of music's top-selling artists with sold-out tours and a slew of awards. Knowles has also starred in several films, including Dream Girls. She married hip-hop recording artist Jay-Z in 2008. In late 2013, she surprised audiences by releasing her fifth studio album, self-titled Beyoncé, and has twice performed at the Super Bowl. She released her sixth studio album, Lemonade, after the airing of an HBO special in April 2016, and two years later she dropped a joint album with Jay-Z, Everything Is Love, while the two were on tour.  Singer and actress Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She started singing at an early age, competing in local talent shows and winning many of these events by impressing audiences with her singing and dancing abilities.  On the musical front, Beyoncé took center stage as a solo artist, releasing her first album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. The recording became a huge success for her both commercially and critically. It sold millions of copies and won five Grammy Awards. On the album, Beyoncé worked with a number of different artists, including Missy Elliott , Sean Paul and Jay-Z. She was rumored to be dating Jay-Z around this time, but the couple did not publicly acknowledge their relationship.  While enjoying her group's success, Beyoncé began exploring other projects. She made her acting debut in 2001 with a starring role in MTV's Carmen: A Hip Hopera. She then co-starred with Mike Myers in the Austin Powers spy parody Goldmember the following year.  Teaming up with her cousin, Kelly Rowland , and two classmates, Beyoncé formed an all-female singing group. Her father, Matthew Knowles, served as the band's manager. The group went through some name and line-up changes before landing a record deal in 1997 with Columbia Records. Destiny's Child soon became one of the most popular R&B acts, with the release of their first, self-titled album. Gaining momentum, the group scored its first No. 1 single on the pop charts with ""Bills, Bills, Bills,"" off their second album. The recording also featured another smash hit, ""Say My Name.""  On her own, Beyoncé continued to enjoy great success. Her second studio album, 2006's B'Day featured such hits as ""Irreplaceable"" and ""Deja Vu."" On the big screen, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jaime Foxx and Eddie Murphy in Dreamgirls. The film was adapted from the hit Broadway musical of the same name.  Beyoncé and Jay-Z  In 2008, Beyoncé married rapper and music mogul Jay-Z in a small, private ceremony in New York City. Among the guests sighted at the wedding were Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles; her father and manager, Matthew; her sister, Solange; Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams; and friend Gwyneth Paltrow.  The newlywed continued to work as hard as ever, promoting her latest effort, I am ... Sasha Fierce (2008). Beyoncé scored two big hits off the album—""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" and ""If I Were a Boy."" She also returned to the big screen that year, starring as R&B legend Etta James in Cadillac Records. The following January, Beyoncé sang James' trademark song, ""At Last,"" for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at his inaugural ball.  In addition to acting and performing, Beyoncé ran a clothing line called House of Dereon with her mother. She also launched her own fragrance, Heat, in 2010. Throughout her career, Beyoncé has served as a spokesperson and model for several other brands, including L'Oreal and Tommy Hilfiger.  Beyoncé found herself under fire after performing a private concert for Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi on New Year's Eve in 2010. She later donated her fee from the event to help victims of the Haitian earthquake. According to some reports, Beyoncé said that her father had been responsible for arranging the Libyan concert. She decided to drop her father as her manager in March 2011. Later that year, Beyoncé reached the top of the album charts with her latest solo release, 4.  In January 2013, Beyoncé generated some negative headlines for her performance at President Obama's second inauguration in Washington, D.C. She was criticized for reportedly pre-recording a version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and lip-syncing to her own track during the outdoor ceremony. Despite wide media coverage, in the days following the incident, Beyoncé did not publicly address the controversy.  Not long after, prior to her appearance at Super Bowl XLVII, Beyoncé performed the song live at a press conference. She explained to reporters that she had used a ""backing track"" at the inauguration, adding that she would ""absolutely be singing live"" at the NFL's biggest event of the year, according to The Huffington Post.  Indeed, Beyoncé more than redeemed herself in the public eye at the Super Bowl on February 3, 2013. During the event's halftime show, she took the stage and wowed the crowd, joined by her former Destiny's Child bandmates Rowland and Williams for parts of her performance. Beyoncé also announced that her next major tour would start in the spring of 2013.  Beyoncé attends TIDAL X 1015 in New York City. Photo: Theo WargoGetty Images for TIDAL  Awards, Accolades and Surprise Album  At the 2010 Grammy Awards, Beyoncé walked away with six honors—the most wins in a single night by a female artist. Her record was matched two years later by pop/soul artist Adele. In 2010, she also tied the record for most No. 1 hits on Billboard’s Pop Songs chart, which is based on radio airplay. In 2011, she made the Forbes Top 10 list of entertainment's highest-earning women. By 2013, Beyoncé had won 16 Grammys.  Beyoncé broke records once again on December 13, 2013, with her fifth studio album, self-titled Beyoncé. The album surprised fans and critics alike, as no promotion for the album had been announced prior to its release. The record, which Beyoncé called a ""visual album,"" was released exclusively on iTunes, with physical discs available for purchase after December 18. The record-breaking album sold more than 800,000 copies throughout the weekend it was released alone.  The collection—which was the fastest-selling album ever distributed by iTunes—also marked Beyoncé's fifth studio album to debut at No. 1, making her the first woman to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with her first five albums. She released the Platinum Edition of the album in 2014, and the following year won three additional Grammys, including a Best R&B Performance award for ""Drunk in Love.""  Second Super Bowl and 'Lemonade'  In February 2016, Beyoncé returned to the Super Bowl stage, once again earning raves for her performance. This time around she appeared with Bruno Mars and Chris Martin of the band Coldplay, highlighting her new single ""Formation"" and subsequently announcing a world tour. The tune, its video and accompanying halftime show also garnered a wave of attention for politicized lyrics and imagery touching on everything from black power to Hurricane Katrina.  Just two months later, HBO aired an hour-long Beyoncé conceptual film, Lemonade, which presented tracks from the album of the same name released immediately afterward. The cable special showcased the singer reeling from the romantic and sexual betrayal of her partner while acknowledging the strength found in communities of African-American women. Tennis star Serena Williams and young actress Quvenzhané Wallis also made appearances in the New Orleans-based project, which was helmed by a variety of directors and featured poetry from Warsan Shire.  Lemonade the album was only initially available via Tidal, the online streaming service backed by Beyoncé's spouse, Jay-Z, and then eventually became available on iTunes and Amazon with its accompanying film. Musical contributors to the project, which quickly garnered acclaim, included Jack White, The Weeknd, James Blake and Kendrick Lamar. Lemonade debuted at No. 1, making Beyoncé the only artist in history to have all of her first six studio albums reach the top of Billboard's album charts.  In February 2017, a pregnant Beyoncé delivered a surprise performance at the Grammys, singing songs from Lemonade amid a swirling spectacle of lights, holograms and backup dancers. Although she lost the coveted Album of the Year Grammy to Adele, she did take home two awards, for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video.  Known as ""Queen Bey,"" the famed singer readied to take on the role of a different queen with the November 2017 announcement that she was headlining a remake of Disney's The Lion King. Scheduled for a 2019 release, the live action reboot of the 1994 animated hit will feature Beyoncé as Nala, the budding love interest of the titular character, to be played by Donald Glover.  Shortly afterward, it was revealed that Queen Bey also reigned as the highest-earning female musician of the year. According to Forbes, Beyoncé snagged $105 million in pretax income June 2016 through June 2017, a number that easily outpaced the earnings of fellow divas Adele ($69 million) and Taylor Swift ($44 million). Forbes attributed the windfall to the success of Lemonade and the singer's Formation World Tour, which grossed approximately $250 million.  Coachella, OTR II and 'Everything Is Love'  In March 2018, reports surfaced that Beyoncé was working on new music and preparing to hit the road with Jay-Z. Following a false alarm in which a tour announcement appeared and quickly disappeared from her Facebook page, the power couple officially announced that their On the Run II (or OTR II) Tour would kick off in Cardiff, Wales, on June 6.  One year after she canceled a planned appearance at Coachella because of her pregnancy, Beyoncé took the stage for an eagerly anticipated performance at the April 2018 music festival. The first black woman to headline the event, Beyoncé wowed attendees and critics alike with her top-shelf singing and choreography, delivering favorites like ""Crazy In Love"" and a rendition of the civil rights anthem ""Lift Every Voice and Sing."" She was also joined during the two-hour set by hubby Jay-Z, sister Solange and her old Destiny's Child cohorts, Rowland and Williams.  One week later, Beyoncé delivered another highly acclaimed show at the festival. While the 27-song set and guest list remained nearly identical, the headliner shook things up with her costume changes, coming across as looser and more ""off-the-cuff,"" according to Rolling Stone.  In June, Beyoncé and Jay-Z embarked on the European leg of their 48-date tour. While they lived up to expectations with their theatrics and swagger, the couple also surprised fans with the release of their joint album, Everything Is Love, following a London show on June 16. Initially available for streaming only on the Jay-Z owned Tidal, the nine-track album was accompanied by a video for the track ""Apes**t,"" which featured the couple and their dancers gallivanting around some of the world's most famous artworks at the Louvre in Paris.  Later in the tour, during a performance in Atlanta, Beyoncé and Jay-Z faced a potentially dangerous moment when an audience member climbed on stage and attempted to chase the stars backstage, before the backup dancers banded together to stop the intruder.  Around that time, Beyoncé earned her fourth cover spread and story for Vogue. The production made headlines for the singer's control over the photo shoot, for which she wore minimal makeup and showed off her natural hair, as well as her unfiltered interview in which she embraced her ""FUPA"" — the leftover weight gain in the abdominal area from her pregnancy.",0

"Keith Lionel Urban (born 26 October 1967) is a New Zealand country music singer, musician, songwriter, and record producer. In 1991, he released a self-titled debut album and charted four singles in Australia before moving to the United States the following year. He found work as a session guitarist before starting a band known as The Ranch, which recorded one studio album on Capitol Nashville and charted two singles on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.  Still signed to Capitol, Urban made his solo American debut in 1999 with a second eponymous album. Certified platinum in the US by the RIAA, it produced his first number one on the Hot Country Songs chart with ""But for the Grace of God"". ""Somebody Like You"", the first single from his second Capitol album Golden Road (2002), was named by Billboard as the biggest country hit of the 2000s decade. The album's fourth single, ""You'll Think of Me"", featuring his nephew and Australian country artist Rory Gilliatte, earned him his first Grammy Award. 2004's Be Here, his third American album, produced three more number one singles and became his highest-selling album, having earned a 4× Platinum certification. Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing was released in 2006, containing ""Once in a Lifetime"" as well as his second Grammy Award song ""Stupid Boy"". A greatest hits package entitled Greatest Hits: 18 Kids followed in late 2007. Defying Gravity and Get Closer were released on 31 March 2009 and 16 November 2010, respectively. In September 2013, he released a brand new album titled Fuse, which produced four more number ones on the Country Airplay chart, two of which are duets—one with Miranda Lambert and the other with Eric Church. A new single, entitled ""John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16"", was released in June 2015 as the lead-off single to his eighth American studio album Ripcord. The album later produced the Country Airplay chart number one hits ""Break on Me"", ""Wasted Time"", and ""Blue Ain't Your Color"", with the latter also becoming Urban's longest-reigning number one on the Hot Country Songs chart, spending twelve weeks at number one. His tenth album, Graffiti U, was released in 2018 and includes the Top 20 hit ""Female"".  Urban has released a total of nine studio albums (one of which was released only in Australia), as well as one album with The Ranch. He has charted 37 singles on the US Hot Country Songs chart, 18 of which went to number one, counting a duet with Brad Paisley and the 2008 single ""You Look Good in My Shirt"", which he previously recorded on Golden Road. Those also include his third Grammy Award-winning single ""Sweet Thing"" from his album Defying Gravity.  Urban is also known for his roles as a coach on the Australian version of the singing competition The Voice and as a judge on American Idol. Since 2006, he has been married to actress Nicole Kidman. In October 2013, Urban introduced his own signature line of guitars and accessories.  Early life [ edit ]  Keith Urban in Sydney , Australia  Keith Lionel Urban was born on 26 October 1967, in Whangarei, New Zealand,[4] He is the youngest son of Marienne and Robert ""Bob"" Urban. He lived with his parents in Caboolture, Queensland, Australia. His father, who owned a convenience store, put an ad for a guitar teacher in his shop window.[5] Urban took lessons from his teacher, Sue McCarthy[6], and began entering local competitions, in addition to acting in a local theater company.[4] Urban has stated that his guitar playing was influenced by two rock players, Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits) and Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac).  In 1983, Urban was a contestant on the Australian TV talent show New Faces.[7] A few years later, he began making the inroads into the Australian country music scene, with regular appearances on the Reg Lindsay Country Homestead TV Program, Mike McClellan's Music Program, and various other TV programs performing duets with local Brisbane girl Jenny Wilson. They won a Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. Urban also performed regularly on stage at the Northern Suburbs Country Music Club in Bald Hills, where he was a member. He was in a band called 'Kids Country', that performed during school holidays at various venues and made appearances on the Reg Lindsey show and Conway Country. He also teamed up with Angie Marquis, Tony Black, Peter Black and Tina Rouaen in a teen rock band that performed during the summer holidays at the local water slide and theme park.  Musical career [ edit ]  1990–1999: Early years [ edit ]  In 1990, Urban signed with EMI in Australia and released his self-titled debut album.[4] He appeared on the 1990 compilation album Breaking Ground - New Directions in Country Music which was nominated for the 1991 ARIA Award for Best Country Album.[8] He toured as a backup act to Slim Dusty between 1993 and 1994. In the mid-1990s, both people recorded a re-worked duet of Dusty's classic ""Lights on the Hill"". Urban appeared for the first time at the Grand Ole Opry backing Dusty.[9] He also sang backing vocals on INXS's live album Live Baby Live (1992).  Urban moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1992. The next year, he appeared in the music video for Alan Jackson's rendition of ""Mercury Blues"".[10] He and Vernon Rust co-wrote ""Jesus Gets Jealous of Santa Claus"" on Toby Keith's 1995 album Christmas to Christmas,[11] 4 Runner's 1996 single ""That Was Him (This Is Now)"",[12] and ""Tangled Up in Love"" on the Raybon Brothers' 1997 self-titled album.[13] In 1997, he formed a band known as The Ranch, which included drummer Peter Clarke and bassist Jerry Flowers. The Ranch released one self-titled album for Capitol Records Nashville and charted two singles on the Hot Country Songs charts that year: ""Walkin' the Country"" and ""Just Some Love"".[14] Throughout the late 1990s, Urban also played guitar on several other artists' albums, such as Paul Jefferson,[15] Tim Wilson, and Charlie Daniels.  1999–2001: Keith Urban [ edit ]  Urban released his self-titled American debut album in 1999 under the production of session pianist Matt Rollings. It was led by the number 18 single ""It's a Love Thing"", followed by the number-four ""Your Everything"", which made him the first male New Zealand performer to reach the Top 10 on the US country charts.[16] Its follow-up, ""But for the Grace of God"", written by Charlotte Caffey and Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's, became his first number 1 hit on the charts.

He won the Top New Male Vocalist Award at the 2001 Academy of Country Music Awards and the 2001 Country Music Association's Horizon Award. Allmusic's Thom Jurek described the first and third singles favorably, and praised the instrumental track ""Rollercoaster"", saying that Urban was ""flat picking his Stratocaster like it was another extremity he was born with."" He thought that those songs ""balance the slick and sometimes too-soft production on the record"".[17]  2002–2006: Golden Road & Be Here [ edit ]  Urban released his second American album Golden Road in 2002. Of the 13 songs included on this album, Urban produced seven himself and co-produced the other six with Dann Huff.[18] The album's lead-off single ""Somebody Like You"" was released in July 2002 and spent six weeks at number-one. The second single was the number-three hit ""Raining on Sunday"", which Radney Foster had previously released as a single from his 1998 album See What You Want to See.[19] The third and fourth singles from the album, ""Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me"" and ""You'll Think of Me"", went to number-one, with the latter winning him the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2005.[20]  On 22 September 2005, Urban's third studio album Golden Road was certified triple platinum, for sales of three million copies.[21]  In 2002, Urban posed nude for Playgirl. On the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, he stated on that he regrets posing nude despite not showing any full frontal nudity.[22]  Urban performed ""Lights on the Hill"" for Tamworth's 2004 tribute concert following the death of Australia's Slim Dusty, an artist whom he had both written for and covered.[23][24]  In 2005, Urban performed in front of European audiences for the first time. In May, Urban supported Bryan Adams on his UK and Ireland tour, which included dates at Earls Court, London, SECC, Glasgow and The Point, Dublin. On 6 June a UK only album, Days Go By, was released. The album contained songs from both Be Here and Golden Road.  ""You Look Good in My Shirt"" was originally intended to be the fifth single from this album.[25] Instead, Capitol chose to release ""Days Go By"", the lead-off to his third American album Be Here. By late 2004, this song became Urban's fifth number-one hit on the country chart. Although it was not officially released, ""You Look Good in My Shirt"" spent one-week at number 60 on the country charts in July 2004[26] and remained a fan favorite.[25] The next single from this album was the #2 ""You're My Better Half"", followed by the five-week number 1 ""Making Memories of Us"", which was written by Rodney Crowell and previously recorded by both Tracy Byrd[27] and Crowell's side project The Notorious Cherry Bombs.[28] The next singles from this album were ""Better Life"" and ""Tonight I Wanna Cry"". The former, which Urban wrote with Richard Marx, spent six weeks at number 1 and the latter spent three weeks at number 2. After this song, ""Live to Love Another Day"" spent 14 weeks on the country chart, reaching a peak of number 48, although it was never officially released as a single.[26]  2006–2008: Love, Pain, & The Whole Crazy Thing and Greatest Hits: 18 Kids [ edit ]  On 21 August 2006, Urban's ""Once in a Lifetime"" debuted at No. 17, setting what was then a new record for the highest-debuting country single in the 62-year history of the Hot Country Songs chart.[29] Despite the high debut, the song peaked at number 6.[20] Following it was ""Stupid Boy"", which was co-written by Sarah Buxton, went to number 3, and won him his second Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2007.[20] The album's next two singles, ""I Told You So"" and ""Everybody"", respectively peaked at numbers 2 and 5.[20] Urban released his first greatest hits collection Greatest Hits: 18 Kids on 20 November 2007. This compilation contains all of his Top 10 hits, along with two new songs, ""Romeo's Tune"" and ""Got It Right This Time (The Celebration)"".  In January 2008, Urban embarked on the ""Love, Pain and the Whole Crazy Carnival Ride World Tour"" with fellow country singer Carrie Underwood. In early May 2008, Urban debuted a new song at the Grand Ole Opry titled ""A New Sunshine"". That same month, Urban recorded a new version of ""You Look Good in My Shirt"" and released it as a single in June of that year. ""Over the years it (""You Look Good In My Shirt"") has always played like a hit song,"" Urban said. ""That, combined with numerous requests from both fans and radio about why it was never a single, inspired us to get back into the studio and re-record the song."" The single was a precursor to the ""Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour"" concert DVD release in fall of 2008. Later that year, Urban served as a duet artist for Brad Paisley's single ""Start a Band"", on which both he and Paisley sang and played guitar. This song was included on Paisley's album Play and it went to No. 1 in January 2009.  2008–2010: Defying Gravity [ edit ]  Urban announced that the lead single for his fifth studio album would be entitled ""Sweet Thing"". This song became his 10th number one hit. Capitol Records released the album, Defying Gravity, on 31 March 2009. The second single, ""Kiss a Girl"",[30] was released in March 2009. Urban performed this song on American Idol, during the season 8 finale, as a duet with eventual winner Kris Allen. ""Only You Can Love Me This Way"", the third single, went to number-one. The fourth single, ""'Til Summer Comes Around"", went to number-three. The fifth and final single ""I'm In"" is a cover of song by Radney Foster, taken from the same album as ""Raining on Sunday"" was. This song was also recorded by The Kinleys,[19] whose version had been a Top 40 single in 2000. Urban's rendition went to number-two. Between the two, Urban also made a guest appearance on then-labelmate Emily West's single ""Blue Sky"", which charted at number-38.  Urban's 2009 Escape Together tour, supporting the Defying Gravity album, featured many big name opening acts, such as Taylor Swift, Sugarland, and Jason Aldean. On 27 June 2009, Urban filmed a video for the song, ""Only You Can Love Me This Way"", at the Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa.  In 2009, Urban was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.  2010–2012: Get Closer [ edit ]  In May 2010, Urban entered the studio to begin work on a new album.[31] The recording process was documented in a blog on his official website. At the beginning of September, it was announced that the album would be titled Get Closer and would see release on 16 November. ""Put You in a Song"" was released as its first single on 13 September.[32] It went to number 2, followed by ""Without You"", ""Long Hot Summer"", and ""You Gonna Fly"", all of which went to number 1. Urban wrote ""Put You in a Song"" with Sarah Buxton and Jedd Hughes, and ""Long Hot Summer"" with Richard Marx. Preston Brust and Chris Lucas, who comprise the LoCash Cowboys, co-wrote ""You Gonna Fly"" with Jaren Johnston, then-member of the group American Bang. After ""You Gonna Fly"" fell from the charts, Urban released ""For You"", which was featured as the theme song of the 2012 action film Act of Valor and appeared on the film's soundtrack. The song peaked at number 6 on the country charts.  On 10 April 2012, Urban was invited to be a member of the Grand Ole Opry by Vince Gill at the third annual We're All for the Hall benefit concert which Urban organized. He was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on 21 April 2012.[33]  Urban plays guitar on Tim McGraw's early-2013 single ""Highway Don't Care"", which also features a guest vocal from Taylor Swift. This song is the third single from McGraw's album Two Lanes of Freedom.  2013–2015: Fuse [ edit ]  Urban performing at Darien Lake on 25 July 2014  On 13 May 2013, Urban released the single ""Little Bit of Everything"", produced by Nathan Chapman.[34] It was the first single from his eighth studio album, Fuse, which was released on 10 September 2013.[35] The official music video for ""Little Bit Of Everything"" debuted on VEVO on 25 July 2013.

""Blue Ain't Your Color"" was released as the album's fourth single and became a huge hit for Urban. It topped the Hot Country Songs chart as well as the Country Airplay Chart, spending twelve weeks at number one on the former chart. ""The Fighter"", a duet with Carrie Underwood, was released as the fifth single from the album.  In 2016, Urban was selected as one of thirty artists to perform on ""Forever Country"", a medley of ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"", ""On the Road Again"", and ""I Will Always Love You"" which celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards.[40]  2017–present: Graffiti U [ edit ]  On 8 November 2017, Urban released a new song entitled ""Female"", which has been described as ""an empowerment anthem partially inspired by the Harvey Weinstein scandal."" Urban said that the song ""[i]s a husband and a father of two young girls."" ""It affects me in a lot of ways. And as a son -- my mother is alive,"" he added. ""It just speaks to all of the females in my life, particularly. For a guy who grew up with no sisters in a house of boys, it’s incredible how now I’m surrounded by girls. But not only in my house; I employ a huge amount of women in my team. The song just hit me for so many reasons."" Kidman provided background vocals on the song. The song would serve as the lead single for Urban's tenth studio album.[41]  It was announced that Urban's tenth studio album would be entitled Graffiti U and that a world tour in support of it will begin in summer 2018.[42] On 19 January, the song ""Parallel Line"" was released as the album's second single.[43] On 21 March, Urban released the album's third single ""Coming Home"", a heavily pop-influenced, upbeat song featuring a duet with pop singer Julia Michaels.

Urban met Australian actress Nicole Kidman at G'Day LA, a Hollywood event honoring Australians, in January 2005, but they reportedly did not begin dating until six months later. Kidman and Urban were married on Sunday, 25 June 2006, at the Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel in the grounds of St Patrick's Estate, Manly, in Sydney.  On 19 October 2006, Urban checked himself into the Betty Ford Center in California.

One can never let one's guard down on recovery, and I'm afraid that I have."" On 18 January 2007, Urban announced his completion of rehab and his plans to go on tour to promote his album, Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing.[58]  On 2 February 2007, Urban filed a lawsuit against a New Jersey painter by the same name, who has a website called KeithUrban.com.

On 1 October 2007, while riding, Urban skidded off his motorbike when a paparazzo followed him near his home in Sydney; Urban was not hurt.

"The Originals is getting The Vampire Diaries treatment. Exactly a year after the end date for The Vampire Diaries was announced, The Originals creator/showrunner Julie Plec unveiled that the upcoming fifth season of the TVD spinoff will be its last. (read her entire heartfelt post below) Like with the original series, The Originals, which will return for its last chapter next midseason, will get a chance to craft a final chapter and allow fans to bid the show a proper good-bye.

"Laura Dern wins an Emmy for her performance in ""Big Little Lies."" Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP  Laura Dern won an Emmy Sunday night for her supporting role in HBO's ""Big Little Lies."" And while she thanked her co-stars (many of them nominees as well) in her speech, she may have snubbed one of them on her way to the stage.  In the CBS broadcast of her winning the award, it shows Dern hugging co-stars Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley (who she beat in the category of supporting actress in a limited TV series or movie), but skipping over Reese Witherspoon, who also starred in ""Big Little Lies.""  People are freaking out over the apparent snub.  A more likely solution is that the aired footage simply didn't show the hug between Witherspoon and Dern. At the beginning of the shot where Dern hugs her co-stars, it looks like she's pulling away from Witherspoon, as if they had just embraced.  Laura Dern getting up, probably from hugging Reese Witherspoon. CBS  It's also possible that Dern was just gripping the seat in front of her as she was getting up. It's not totally clear.  Dern also, after all, did give a shoutout to Witherspoon in her speech. ""I share this with my tribe of four ladies,"" she said, referring to her co-stars Witherspoon, Kidman, Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz. So there probably isn't any beef between them.  Also, it's just kind of awkward to hug someone in the seat in front of you. The chair is in the way. What's she supposed to do? Like, hug the back of her neck? Tap her on the shoulder? Everyone watching is waiting for her to come onstage.  Kidman and Witherspoon are themselves nominees in the leading actress category for a TV miniseries or movie, which will be awarded Sunday night.",0
"Three years after announcing their separation and more than a year after filing for divorce, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are still legally married — and they may be that way for a while if they don’t act fast.  LA County Superior Court advised the couple that their divorce case may be delayed because they have yet to file and enter the final judgment, a document obtained by The Blast revealed.  “If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,” the document states.  It’s unclear what the holdup is.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, were married for nearly 10 years before separating in 2015. Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.  Shortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.  The exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.  “We are definitely a modern family. We’re doing really well,” Garner said previously. “It has to be [children first]. You have no choice. It has to be.”  Reps for Garner and Affleck did not immediately return requests for comment.

"Some residents also complained that a man open carrying a handgun made them feel “uncomfortable” and “unsafe…”(Zero Hedge) A man in Seattle has had his gun confiscated by police after breaking no laws. The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges. Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil.This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.The new “red flag” law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and they’ve just begun the confiscation. A man living in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington became the first individual in the state to have his firearm confiscated without any formal arrest or charges. The man was not identified by authorities.** MORE GUN CONFISCATION COVERAGE at Liberty Headlines **Neighbors complained that the man had been “staring” at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. He was not brandishing his weapon by any account, and open carrying is legal in the area, so he was abiding by the law.

"Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are moving on with their lives a year after filing.  The duo filed to end their 10-year marriage on April 13, 2016, nearly two years after they originally announced their split. The divorce isn’t yet finalized but is progressing, sources have said, as the two have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately.  Since then, they have continued to happily co-parent their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck has been shooting his new movie Triple Frontier.  “They’re doing well, and are both committed to providing a supportive environment for their kids,” a source close to Affleck tells PEOPLE. “They continue to remain cordial to one another.

The kids were all very interested in learning about the animals. They all seem like huge dolphin fans.”  During the trip, Garner stayed at a resort while Affleck stayed at a nearby house. “Jen seemed excited about the trip. She hasn’t been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,” added the source.  “The kids love when they all spend time together,” said a second source.  When filming breaks allow, the actor, 45, visits the kids at home in Los Angeles. “He’s found a really good routine,” an insider said. “He’s in a great place, enjoying his work on the new film and being able to fly back to spend time with the family during downtime.”  Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus.

"According to our source, who was at the taping for the show that will air on Thursday, Kardashian is very “hurt” by Jenner’s new memoir, The Secrets of My Life, which alleges her mom Kris is lying when she says she didn’t knowing that Jenner wanted to transition for a number of years before their marriage fell apart. “My heart breaks for my mom, because she’s been through so much,” Kardashian said during the interview. “It’s unfair. Things aren’t truthful. I feel like it’s taken [Caitlyn] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don’t expect her to be honest about my mom now. It’s so hurtful.” As a result, she’s not talking to Jenner right now.  Kim Kardashian taped the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Wednesday, and Gossip Cop has exclusive details from her first talk show interview since being robbed in Paris. We’re told she talked about that harrowing experience, how she no longer speaks to Caitlyn Jenner, and what she’s doing for Kanye West’s upcoming 40th birthday. Check out the videos below!  The audience member also leaks that Kardashian spoke to DeGeneres at length about the Paris robbery, saying that it “changed” her life. “I know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me. I feel like it was so meant to happen. I’m such a different person,” she shared. Kardashian continued, “My whole life as changed as far as how I travel and security.

If you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I’m traveling and I didn’t. Now, I have several, just for me to be able to sleep at night.” The reality star fully believed she was going to die, and now she no longer cares about possessions and materialistic items.  Kardashian also discussed life with her kids following the frightening ordeal in Paris, and said her 1-and-a-half year-old son Saint is her “10,” which the audience member understood to mean is a “perfect baby.” And, after DeGeneres asked about West and his well-being, Kardashian noted that the rapper’s 40th birthday is on June 8, and she’s still struggling with what she should do to mark his milestone. At that point, we’re told, the talk show host offered to host the entire Kardashian family for a one-hour birthday party. No word yet whether Kardashian will take DeGeneres up on the invitation.

""We're not going to pressure him to create more seasons if he doesn't feel they are there, but he is already starting to think about what a season three could be,"" she said.  13 Reasons Why season 2 cast: Will Hannah be back?  Despite showrunner Yorkey playing around with the idea of making 13 Reasons Why an anthology series at one point – à la True Detective – season two will keep the same cast and the same setting.  Most notably, yes, Katherine Langford will be back as Hannah Baker.  Netflix  ""I think one of the things that is still hanging out there is this question of, is someone responsible for Hannah's death?"" Yorkey said. ""Is the school responsible? Who is responsible, if anyone is?  ""One way we'll explore that question is through the trial and also through all of these kids reflecting on where they are a few months down the road and what other secrets are being uncovered.  ""That's going to take us into the past, into Hannah's story.""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  And you'll definitely be seeing a lot of Hannah. HuffPost says that season two will ""will feature [her] in more scenes than even Langford expected"".  In a later interview, Langford teased: ""You see a very different Hannah in season two. I would prepare fans not to expect the Hannah from season one for a multitude of reasons.""  We also can't have a second season without Clay Jensen. Actor Dylan Minnette is too, confirming via this pretty cool Instagram snap:  Minnette shed some light into the second season by saying that the never-before-seen flashbacks with Hannah in the new episodes will cover new ground by featuring other characters rather than himself.  Ross Butler (Zach Dempsey) all but confirmed his return back in April 2017, after he revealed that he dropped out of Riverdale to be part of the second season of 13 Reasons Why.  Christian Navarro (Tony Padilla) tweeted that he was back on set, while Kate Walsh (Olivia Baker) gave an interview revealing the part her character will play in the new episodes.  Brandon Flynn (Justin Foley) said he was excited for season two, posting on Instagram: ""Can't wait to get back to work with this beautiful team!"" (Side-note: Flynn will also be seen in True Detective season three on HBO in 2019.)  Alisha Boe (Jessica Davis) and Justin Prentice (Bryce Walker) are back, with Yorkey stating his interest in continuing their stories (more on that later), while Miles Heizer (Alex Standall) suggested his cliffhanger will be addressed – meaning he will return in some form.

Netflix  Devin Druid (Tyler Down), Amy Hargreaves (Lainie Jensen), Ajiona Alexus (Sherri Holland), Tommy Dorfman (Ryan Shaver), and Timothy Granaderos (Montgomery de la Cruz) all shared the season two teaser video on Twitter and/or Instagram following the show's renewal – which implies that they are all interested in coming back as well.  Brian d'Arcy James (Hannah Baker's father Andy) said in an interview that he would love to return.  And could we finally see justice for Jeff? Brandon Larracuente shared in an interview that he would love to play Jeff Atkins again, and suggested that he could feature in flashbacks.  ""Considering the entire first season, Jeff was shown entirely in flashbacks, that could be a possibility,"" he said.  Instagram @selenagomez  Selena Gomez didn't make a cameo in season one, and fans shouldn't expect her to appear in season two, either.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Hargreaves commented on the possibility of Selena popping up, saying: ""It would kinda distract from the main story. So I can't imagine that she would pop up for a cameo, but who knows? You never know.""  The show held an open casting call in June, looking for ""students, baseball players, track and field athletes, cheerleaders, boxers, parents, teachers, and coffee shop patrons"". Actors of ""all ages, types, and ethnicities"" were encouraged to attend.  In August, a few new characters were announced...  Kelli O'Hara, a Tony award-winning Broadway actress and star of Masters of Sex, will join the cast as Jackie, an ""advocate for victims of bullying"" (via TVLine).  Other cast additions include Bryce Cass, who will play Cyrus, described as ""an edgy, cynical mischief maker"" and his on-screen sister Mackenzie, played by Chelsea Alden (who you might recognise from American Horror Story), who is ""artsy, witty"" and outspoken.  Also joining students at Liberty High School for season two will be Samantha Logan (The Fosters) as track star Nina and Anne Winters (Tyrant) playing head cheerleader Chloe.

Meanwhile, Kings' Allison Miller is going to be playing a young litigator, Sonya, who we would imagine will be playing a role in the lawsuit Hannah's parents have filed against the school.  Now I get to stop hiding what I've been up to recently!! 🤗 Honored to be a part of this discussion. https://t.co/pRdyXrhPTq — Allison Miller Nee (@allisonemiller) August 8, 2017  Brenda Strong and Jake Weber are playing Bryce's parents Nora and Barry, and Meredith Monroe has been announced as Alex's mother Carolyn.  RJ Brown will take on the role of Caleb, Tony's boxing trainer with a ""wry sense of humour"".  13 Reasons Why season 2 spoilers: What will happen?  Firstly, the tapes are being scrapped. Those cassettes still exist, of course, but rather the episodes will no longer be structured around Hannah's narration.  Instead, there will be a ""different sort of analogue technology that plays a hugely important role in season two"", showrunner Yorkey teased. ""The cassette tapes aren't at the centre of it – those two boxes of tapes are still hanging around and matter to people, but there will be a new piece of technology for 13-year-olds to Google and try to understand what it was.""  Netflix  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Season two will keep the multiple-timeline storytelling, but Hannah is no longer the narrator. Instead, somebody else will be providing the voiceover.  We will see ""other perspectives on Hannah's story"", too. This is particularly interesting, because there were a couple of moments in the first season where certain characters questioned Hannah's ""truth"".  Of note, remember the letter that Hannah gave to Zach? The one which she claimed he had thrown away, thus rejecting her plea for help?  The reality is that Zach actually kept the note. Did Hannah lie, or was she just mistaken? Maybe that will be explained.  Netflix  ""Hannah told her version of events, but there are at least 12 kids who have another version of those events that we actually haven't really heard from yet,"" Yorkey said.  Time-wise, the second season will pick up ""a number of months"" after season one (according to Yorkey), and will in part cover the trial and the Bakers' lawsuit against the school.  Kate Walsh (Hannah's mother Olivia Baker) teased: ""We'll see more and more of the mystery getting revealed, and I think you see Mrs Baker still questing for the answers of what happened to her daughter.""  You should also expect a number of other loose ends to be addressed when the show returns. Most of the characters were in a dark place by the end of last season (star Miles Heizer confirmed that the show will not shy away from ""taboo topics"" it tackled in the first season), but could some of them find happiness?  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  ""[The individual cliffhangers are] all related, so I would very much like to explore where they all go and to see if there is, as I think there will be, some light for these kids,"" Yorkey said.  Jessica is still trying to recover from her rape, while Bryce – who raped Jessica and Hannah – will hopefully be receiving some form of comeuppance, whatever that may be.  Netflix  ""I want to do Jessica's story the deserved justice of following her as she goes back to school, as she tries to begin to recover from what happened to her, because it's something that millions of young women go through,"" Yorkey said.  ""And also [I want to] see somebody punch Bryce in the face.""  The cast seem to be in agreement as well, with stars such as Alisha Boe and Brandon Flynn saying that they hope to see ""justice for Hannah and Jessica"".  Timothy Granaderos similarly wants the people who wronged Hannah to be ""held accountable"".  Other cliffhangers from the season one finale include what happens with school counsellor Kevin Porter (will he be fired?), Alex's suicide attempt, Zach desperately trying to reach Alex only to receive a call from somebody else, and Tyler's stash of guns.  Netflix  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Selena Gomez, pop singer and one of the producers on the show, said that she has been in the writers' room and that there were story moments she learned which left her ""almost freaking out"".  She later said that the new season will be ""really encouraging and empowering"".  Any fears that 13 Reasons Why would have to censor itself in light of the controversy the show drew for season one (over its depiction of suicide) can rest easy: Dylan Minnette and executive producer Tom McCarthy have both said season two will not be censored.  ""I'm sure it's going to be just as important and dark as last season,"" Minnette said.  The actor added that the second season's theme will be ""recovery"", adding: ""It's naturally going to progressively get to a more emotional place, due to the nature of the story we're telling. I'm sure we're all heading in some dark directions again.""  And new cast member Anne Winters said that the new episodes will be less ""black and white"" compared to season one.  ""This season will explore a little of those grey areas... so that when people raise the question of, 'Well, wasn't it her fault that she did this or that?' this season shows a different take on it,"" she shared.  13 Reasons Why season 2 theories: Did Tyler shoot Alex?  With the way the season one finale ended, it's not surprising that people have been coming up with fan theories about season two – many of which are truly clever and imaginative.  Perhaps the most popular one out there is tied to Alex's cliffhanger. In the finale, Alex was fighting for his life after it was revealed that he shot himself.  We never saw this happen on screen, and fans have suggested that Tyler actually shot him instead. The theory points out that Tyler had a stash of guns hidden in his room, and that he ominously took down Alex's photo that he had previously hung up in his studio.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Netflix  However, Miles Heizer (who plays Alex) has appeared to dismiss that theory.  ""That's another subject that's very rarely shown on screen and is probably a lot more common than people think it is: people attempting to take their lives and it not happening. I'm sure that will bring a crazy set of issues. It would be interesting to go into that,"" he said.  That's not all. Alex was seen in an ambulance – but if you ask some fans, they think that scene is actually a flashforward and it's not Alex there at all. Maybe it's Bryce. Maybe it's Justin.  As for Tyler's stash of guns, one common theory is that he is planning a school shooting.  Netflix  Tyler had photos of numerous other students (including Clay) in his studio – people who have wronged and bullied him. Maybe these students are the targets, and maybe he actually took down Alex's picture because he had decided to spare him (the opposite of the 'Tyler shoots Alex' theory).  Lastly, a lot of fans seem to think that Tony is either a ghost or a figment of Clay's imagination.  This one is a little more difficult to swallow (and indeed, Christian Navarro himself has shot that down), mainly because we have seen Tony interacting with plenty of other characters besides Clay, but it's interesting nonetheless...

"Robert Pattinson seems to have landed himself another serious girlfriend, and she seems way better for him than Kristen Stewart could ever hope to be.  After only two months of dating FKA twigs, Pattinson is supposedly really ""smitten"" with the adorable British singer and appears to be seriously in love, according to People magazine. After the Twilight hunk's anguish-filled years with ex Stewart, we really think that twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, is just that much better for him.  Here are five reasons why we think twigs blows Stewart way out of the water, and is a far better match for the hunky actor.  twigs is way friendlier. The half-Jamaican, half-Spanish rising star is so much friendlier to fans both online and offline as well as to eager photographers. She has a much sweeter disposition and does not make your hair stand on end when giving interviews.  She makes him smile. Spotted on a recent shopping trip together, Pattinson and twigs were constantly smiling and laughing as they tried different outfits on. ""They were trying things on, making suggestions to one another, and he seemed to be really having a good time,"" an onlooker told People. This is a far cry from Pattinson's appearances with Stewart, where both always sported mega-pouts on their faces and looked like someone died on a continuous basis.  She makes him feel relaxed. Every time RPatz and twigs are seen together, he seems very relaxed and comfortable with her. They were recently spotted in Paris walking hand in hand looking très snug and cozy with each other. ""They're very cute together,"" another insider added.  She sings. Pattinson loves him some music. So, 'nuff said on this one.  She's classy. No matter how hard Stewart tried, she just never seemed to pull the classy look together. Blame it on her perpetual grumpiness if you will, but the girl just lacks refinement, even while in the prettiest red carpet looks.",1

"Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.",0

She never appeared on the 6 seasons of the HBO show or the two films  Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall starred in the first and second Sex and the City films which together grossed more than $700million worldwide  Sex and the City executive producer Cindy Chupack filed suit over a Greenwich Village townhouse in 2014.  The house on East Ninth Street is only a few blocks away from the facade of Carrie Bradshaw's iconic apartment on Perry Street in West Village.  Sex and the City producer Cindy Chupack (pictured) said production on the film halted when Michelle Pfeiffer dropped out  Chupack, who has also produced episodes of Modern Family and Divorce, explained in the court documents she put down a $15,000 deposit to rent a home owned by Rebecca Flores.  The producer attempted to cancel the booking the next day after 'one of the lead actresses for the movie, Michelle Pfeiffer' opted out of the film.  Documents state there was no replacement lined up for the 'Scarface' actress.  By the time Chupack asked for her money back, Flores had already cashed the check and refused to refund her.  Chupack sued for $28,500 in damages and Flores fired back, counter-suing for $100,000.  Like Carrie and Mr Big's on-again, off-again relationship, the legal battle dragged on for years until the judge came back with an decision in May.  The order states, 'As a backdrop, plaintiff, a noted screenwriter and movie producer, sought to rent an apartment in Manhattan for three months so she can work on the movie, Sex and the City, that was to be filmed in New York City.  'Plaintiff expressed her interest in renting the apartment listed for $20,000 per month for a three month period, and remitted a non refundable hold fee of $15,000. The filming of the movie did not commence as planned.'  The townhouse is located on East Ninth Street and is just a few blocks away from the home used for the facade of Carrie Bradshaw's apartment on Perry Street  Earlier this month, the judge threw out the producer's lawsuit entirely stating it was not the defendant's fault the movie was cancelled and the contract was clear about the deposit.  It ordered Chupack's husband, plaintiff and attorney Ian Wallach to pay $5,000 on the defendant's first counterclaim in damages and another $5,000 in sanctions.  The court filings detail email communication between the producer and renter which show in early January she wrote to Flores saying she would know if the film was for sure going to happen by February 8.  Though Pfeiffer never starred on Sex and the City during its six season run, she did appear in the fim New Year's Eve in 2011 with Sarah Jessica Parker. The actresses also both have starring roles in HBO shows, Parker in Divorce and Pfeiffer in the upcoming film The Wizard of Lies.  Filming for Sex and the City Three was supposed to start in 2014. Since then, Sarah Jessica Parker has hinted several times another film could be in the works  The pair recently taped an episode of Variety Studio: Actors on Actors where they interviewed each other.  The first Sex and the City movie was released in 2008, and grossed a whopping $415 million at the box office worldwide. The sequel, which was primarily set in Abu Dhabi, generated $288 million worldwide.  Fans have been speculating about a third film for years, emboldened by Sarah Jessica Parker's hints.  In January 2014, she told InStyle magazine, 'A part of me thinks there is one last chapter to tell.'  In 2015 she posted a teasing Instagram of her leaving Bloomingdale's dressed in designer clothes.  Fans couldn't help but wonder, why would Sarah Jessica Parker keep hinting there would be a Sex and the City movie if there wasn't a possibility of another film?  She captioned the photo: 'Well. I guess the cat's out of the (little brown) bag. As usual, we will keep you posted on every detail as we are able. I'm under a strict gag order until then.'  In 2016 while promoting her new show Divorce, SJP reiterated the line about another chapter, 'I will say that the idea, it rests in the butler's pantry. Not on the table, but somebody is holding it fairly nearby.'  Much like her character Miranda, Cynthia Nixon was more pragmatic about her answer when she was asked by the Hollywood Reporter if there would be a third film in 2012.  She said: 'I think we had a wonderful ride. I think it's fine to let it go.'",0
"Atlanta, Georgia has been known for it’s population of homesexual African American men for the past few years, but until recently, this popular opinion was simply a stereotype.Following the release of “Dr. Satan’s White Van”, Tommy Wiseau’s latest movie, taking place in Atlanta, Georgia State University students began a study assessing the sexuality of the male population of the city with surprising results.​The study divided the population into categories of black, white, Asian, and oreo, then divided them further into heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual. Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual.However, due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society, it is expected that the actual percentage of homosexual black men in Atlanta is much larger.​Reactions to the study included both joy and fear as both men and women across the country expressed happiness in the openness of the men surveyed or fear of the “rising number of gays,” says Rednecks Against Being Homo chairwoman Natasha Tarwater.​BDSM enthusiast Reginald Monroe of Atlanta, while walking his leather-clad male slave through downtown, said,",0
"The outrageous Star magazine cover story that has shocked America Star magazine (US)  The Fury star has been separated from the Oscar winner for a year now - although their divorce is not finalised – and even though they were together so long and became parents to six kids, he has concluded they were never a great fit for each other, according to US publication Star.  An insider told Star: “In hindsight, they really had nothing in common besides great sex. He’s sat up many nights going over what happened, and he’s analysed it again and again in therapy. He realises his relationship with Angie was toxic from the start.”  Brad has reportedly admitted he drank too much while married to Angelina and that their hectic schedules and responsibilities as parents drove them apart.  The source added: “Brad’s demons got a hold of him … Ange used to be so exciting. But by the time they had six kids, Ange was so tired that Brad’s needs were put on the back burner.”  Brad Pitt has yet to publicly respond to Star's sensational allegations.",1
"Share this article:  Caitlyn Jenner made a plea for respect for the transgender community as she accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPY Awards.  “This transition has been harder on me than anything I could imagine,” Jenner told the audience at the Microsoft Theater Wednesday night. “That’s the case for so many others besides me. For that reason alone trans people deserve something vital. They deserve your respect.”  Jenner, formerly known as 1976 Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner, received the award to recognize “the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years,” according to ESPN.  Bruce Jenner, who said he has long suffered from gender confusion and told ABC earlier this year that he identifies as a woman, was re-introduced to the world as Caitlyn Jenner on June 1 with a flashy photo spread and feature story in Vanity Fair magazine.  Later that day, ESPN announced plans to give Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, which is presented “to individuals whose contributions transcend sports.”  “Bruce has received many accolades over the years for being one of the greatest Olympians of our time but the ESPYs are honored to celebrate Bruce becoming Caitlyn,” ESPYs executive producer Maura Mandt said.  “She has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.”  Previous recipients of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award include Muhammad Ali, Jim Valvano, Pat Tillman, Robin Roberts and Nelson Mandela. Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL team, received the honor last year.  The selection of Jenner to receive the award has generated some criticism — notably from sportscaster Bob Costas, who dubbed the choice “crass exploitation.”  Some critics suggested that the honor should have gone to Lauren Hill, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor but continued to pursue her dream of playing college basketball.  The Indiana native made the team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and played in four games — while helping to raise more than $1 million for pediatric cancer research.  Hill died on April 10 at age 19.  Hours before the ESPYs ceremony, organizers announced in a statement to USA Today that Hill will be honored during the show — noting that the recognition had always been planned, but was not previously announced.  The ESPY Awards honor celebrities from sports and entertainment to recognize major sports achievements and salute “leading performers and performances.”  Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry received the best male athlete award, beating a field that also included Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt.  MMA fighter Ronda Rousey received the best female athlete award over University of Connecticut basketball guard/forward Breanna Stewart, skiing star Lindsey Vonn and tennis champion Serena Williams.  The ESPYs ceremony were hosted by comedian/actor Joel McHale and televised on ABC.  Here is the list of winners: Best Male Athlete  — Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors Best Female Athlete  — Ronda Rousey, MMA Best Team  — U.S. women’s national soccer team Best Championship Performance  — LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers Best Breakthrough Athlete  — Mo’ne Davis, Little League Baseball Best Record-Breaking Performance  — Peyton Manning throws record-509th touchdown pass Best Upset  — Mississippi over Alabama, college football Best Game  — Super Bowl Best Play  — Odell Beckham Jr. Best Coach/Manager  — Steve Kerr, Golden State Warriors Best Comeback Athlete  — Rob Gronkowski, New England Patriots Best International Athlete  — Lionel Messi, Barcelona/Argentina Best NFL Player  — Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers Best MLB Player  — Mike Trout, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Best NHL Player  — Jonathan Toews, Chicago Blackhawks Best Driver  — Kevin Harvick, NASCAR Best NBA Player  — Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors Best WNBA Player  — Skylar Diggins, Tulsa Shock Best Fighter  — Ronda Rousey, MMA Best Male Golfer  — Jordan Spieth Best Female Golfer  — Lydia Ko Best Male Tennis Player  — Novak Djokovic Best Female Tennis Player  — Serena Williams Best Male College Athlete  — Marcus Mariota, Oregon football Best Female College Athlete  — Missy Franklin, Cal swimming Best Male Action Sports Athlete  — Ryan Dungey, motocross Best Female Action Sports Athlete  — Kelly Clark, snowboarding Best Jockey  — Victor Espinoza Best Male Athlete with a Disability  — Krige Schabort, Triathlon Best Female Athlete with a Disability  — Becca Meyers, swimming Best Bowler  — Jason Belmonte Best MLS Player  — Robbie Keane, Los Angeles Galaxy Special Awards Jimmy V Award for Perseverance  — Devon and Leah Still Pat Tillman Award for Service  — Danielle Green Best Moment  — Lauren Hill Icon Award  — Derek Jeter Arthur Ashe Award for Courage  — Caitlyn Jenner  Caitlyn Jenner: Becoming woman harder than anything was last modified: by  >> Want to read more stories like this?

"Jeopardy redirects here. For other uses, see Jeopardy (disambiguation)  Jeopardy! is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on NBC on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime syndicated edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, The All-New Jeopardy!, ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by Sony Pictures Television, premiered on September 10, 1984.  Both NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by Art Fleming. Don Pardo served as announcer until 1975, and John Harlan announced for the 1978–1979 show. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured Alex Trebek as host and Johnny Gilbert as announcer.  With over 7,000 episodes aired,[3] the daily syndicated version of Jeopardy! has won a record 33 Daytime Emmy Awards as well as a Peabody Award. In 2013, the program was ranked No. 45 on TV Guide's list of the 60 greatest shows in American television history. Jeopardy! has also gained a worldwide following with regional adaptations in many other countries. The daily syndicated series' 35th season premiered on September 10, 2018.[4]  Gameplay [ edit ]  Three contestants each take their place behind a lectern, with the returning champion occupying the leftmost lectern (from the viewer's perspective). The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!. The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages. Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.  First two rounds [ edit ]  Jeopardy! game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round The layout of thegame board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round  The Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty. The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original Jeopardy! series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50. On The All-New Jeopardy!, they ranged from $25 to $125. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500, and were doubled to $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001.[8] On the Super Jeopardy! specials, clues were valued in points rather than in dollars, and ranged in the first round from 200 to 1,000 points.  The Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a hand-held signaling device. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue, phrased in the form of a question. For example, if a contestant were to select ""Presidents for $200"", the resulting clue could be ""This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree"", to which the correct response would be ""Who is/was George Washington?"" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of ""who is/are"" for people or ""what is/are"" for things or words is almost always used.) If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring-in and respond. If no contestant both rings-in and responds correctly, the host gives the correct response; the ""last correct questioner"" chooses the next clue.[9]  Contestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the ""Forrest Bounce,"" a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by Arthur Chu and the strategy's namesake Chuck Forrest, despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well, since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.[10]  From the premiere of the original Jeopardy! until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring-in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing-in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal; attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second. The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was ""distracting to the viewers"" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue. Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud.  The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round (except in Super Jeopardy!, where Double Jeopardy! values ranged from 500 to 2,500 points). The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in Double Jeopardy!;[9] if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern selects first.  A ""Daily Double"" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy! The name and inspiration were taken from a horse racing term. Only the contestant who uncovers a Daily Double may respond to that clue and need not use his/her signaling device to do so. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a ""true Daily Double"") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.[9][14] A correct response adds the value of the wager to the contestant's score, while an incorrect response deducts it. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.[9]  During the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.[14] If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.  Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played. This rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.[17] During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.  Final Jeopardy! [ edit ]  The Final Jeopardy! round features a single clue. At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category, and a commercial break follows. During the break, barriers are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager between $0 and his/her entire score. Contestants write their wagers using a light pen to write on an electronic display on their lectern. After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic ""Think!"" music plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an index card and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a Braille keyboard to type in a wager and response.  Contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.[9] The contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.  The strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.[19]:269 Otherwise, according to Jeopardy! College Champion Keith Williams, the leader will usually wager such that he or she will have a dollar more than twice the second place contestant's score, guaranteeing a win with a correct response.[20] Writing about Jeopardy! wagering in the 1990s, Gilbert and Hatcher said that ""most players wager aggressively"".[19]:269  Winnings [ edit ]  The top scorer(s) in each game retain the value of their winnings in cash, and return to play in the next match. Non-winners receive consolation prizes. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.[21] Since the show does not generally provide airfare or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes alleviate contestants' financial burden. An exception is provided for returning champions who must make several flights to Los Angeles.  Before 1984, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with $0 or a negative score received consolation prizes). This was changed in order to make the game more competitive, and avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won. From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. The current cash consolation prize is provided by Geico.  Returning champions [ edit ]  The winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8, 2003.[25]  Since November 2014,[26] ties for first place following Final Jeopardy! are broken with a tie-breaker clue, resulting in only a single champion being named, keeping their winnings, and returning to compete in the next show. The tied contestants are given the single clue, and the contestant must give the correct question. A contestant cannot win by default if the opponent gives an incorrect question. That contestant must give a correct question to win the game. If neither player gives the correct question, another clue is given.[27] Previously, if two or all three contestants tied for first place, they were declared ""co-champions"", and each retained his or her winnings and (unless one was a five-time champion who retired prior to 2003) returned on the following episode. A tie occurred on the January 29, 2014, episode when Arthur Chu, leading at the end of Double Jeopardy!, wagered to tie challenger Carolyn Collins rather than winning; Chu followed Jeopardy! College Champion Keith Williams's advice to wager for the tie to increase the leader's chances of winning.[28][29] A three-way tie for first place has only occurred once on the Trebek version, on March 16, 2007, when Scott Weiss, Jamey Kirby, and Anders Martinson all ended the game with $16,000.[30] Until March 1, 2018,[26][31] no regular game had ended in a tie-breaker; numerous tournament games have ended with a tie-breaker clue.  If no contestant finishes Final Jeopardy! with a positive total, there is no winner. This has happened on several episodes,[32][33] most recently on January 18, 2016.[34] Three new contestants appear on the next episode. A triple zero has also occurred twice in tournament play (1991 Seniors and 2013 Teen), and also once in a Celebrity Week episode in 1998.[35] All consolation prize money (regular play, with one $2,000 and two $1,000 prizes, and Celebrity play, prize money for charities) are based on standard rules (score after Double Jeopardy!). In tournament play, an additional high scoring non-winner will advance to the next round (but all three players with a zero score in that game are eligible for that position should the score for that non-winner be zero; all tie-breaker rules apply).  A winner unable to return as champion because of a change in personal circumstances – for example, illness or a job offer – may be allowed to appear as a co-champion in a later episode.[36][37][38]  Typically, the two challengers participate in a backstage draw to determine lectern positions. In all situations with three new contestants (most notably tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semifinal and finals.)  Variations for tournament play [ edit ]  Tournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. The winners of these five games, and the four highest scoring non-winners (""wild cards""), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The winners of these three games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.  To prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are ""completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete.""  If there is a tie for the final wild card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.  If two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.  If none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.[41] This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.[41]  In the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day; their score for that leg is recorded as $0.  Conception and development [ edit ]  In a 1964 Associated Press profile released shortly before the original Jeopardy! series premiered, Merv Griffin offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:  My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to New York City from Duluth. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful ""question and answer"" game on the air since the quiz show scandals. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: ""5,280"" – and the question of course was ""How many feet in a mile?"". Another was ""79 Wistful Vista""; that was Fibber and Mollie McGee's address. I loved the idea, went straight to NBC with the idea, and they bought it without even looking at a pilot show.[42][43]  Griffin's first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each, but after finding that this board could not easily be shown on camera, he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each, with five clues in each of six categories. He originally intended the show to require grammatically correct phrasing (e.g., only accepting ""Who is ..."" for a person), but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down, he decided that the show should instead accept any correct response that was in question form. Griffin discarded his initial title for the show, What's the Question?, when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game, claiming, ""It doesn't have enough jeopardies.""  Jeopardy! was not the first game show to give contestants the answers and require the questions. That format had previously been used by the Gil Fates-hosted program CBS Television Quiz, which aired from July 1941 until May 1942.  Personnel [ edit ]  Hosts and announcers [ edit ]  Art Fleming hosted the NBC and syndicated versions from 1964 to 1975, and again from 1978 to 1979. Alex Trebek has hosted the daily syndicated version since 1984.  The first three versions of the show were hosted by Art Fleming. Don Pardo served as announcer for the original NBC version and weekly syndicated version, but when NBC's revival The All-New Jeopardy! launched in 1978, Pardo's announcing duties were taken over by John Harlan.  Alex Trebek has served as host of the daily syndicated version since it premiered in 1984, except when he switched places with Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak as an April Fool's joke on the episode aired April 1, 1997.[50] His most recent contract renewal, from May 2017, takes his tenure through the 2019–2020 season.[51] In the daily syndicated version's first pilot, from 1983, Jay Stewart served as the show's announcer, but Johnny Gilbert took over the role when that version was picked up as a series and has held it since then.  Trebek will be 80 at the time his contract with Jeopardy! expires in 2020. On a Fox News program, he said the odds of retirement in 2020 were 50/50 ""and a little less"". He added that he might continue if he's ""not making too many mistakes"" but would make an ""intelligent decision"" as to when he should give up the emcee role.[52] In November 2018, it was announced that he had renewed his contract as host through 2022.[53]  Clue Crew [ edit ]  The Jeopardy! Clue Crew, introduced on September 24, 2001, is a team of roving correspondents who appear in videos, recorded around the world, to narrate some clues.[54] Explaining why the Clue Crew was added to the show, executive producer Harry Friedman said, ""TV is a visual medium, and the more visual we can make our clues, the more we think it will enhance the experience for the viewer.""[55]  Following the initial announcement of auditions for the team, over 5,000 people applied for Clue Crew posts.[55] The original Clue Crew members were Cheryl Farrell, Jimmy McGuire, Sofia Lidskog, and Sarah Whitcomb.[54] Lidskog departed the Clue Crew in 2004 to become an anchor on the high school news program Channel One News, and a search was held to replace her in early 2005.[56] The winners were Jon Cannon and Kelly Miyahara, who formally joined the crew starting in season 22, which premiered on September 12, 2005.[57] Farrell continued to record clues for episodes aired as late as October 2008,[58] and Cannon continued to appear until July 2009.[59]  The Clue Crew has traveled to 280 cities worldwide, spanning all 50 of the United States and 44 other countries. In addition to appearing in Jeopardy! clue videos, the team's members also travel to meet fans of the show and future contestants. Occasionally, they visit schools to showcase the educational game Classroom Jeopardy![60] Miyahara also serves as announcer for the Sports Jeopardy! spin-off series.[61]  Production staff [ edit ]  Robert Rubin served as the producer of the original Jeopardy! series for most of its run, and later became its executive producer.[62] Following Rubin's promotion, the line producer was Lynette Williams.[62]  Griffin was the daily syndicated version's executive producer until his retirement in 2000. Trebek served as producer as well as host until 1987, when he began hosting NBC's Classic Concentration for the next four years. At that time, he handed producer duties to George Vosburgh, who had formerly produced The All-New Jeopardy!. In the 1997–1998 season, Vosburgh was succeeded as producer by Harry Friedman, Lisa Finneran, and Rocky Schmidt. Beginning in 1999, Friedman became executive producer,[64] and Gary Johnson became the show's new third producer. In the 2006–2007 season, Deb Dittmann and Brett Schneider became the producers, and Finneran, Schmidt, and Johnson were promoted to supervising producers.[62]  The original Jeopardy! series was directed at different times by Bob Hultgren, Eleanor Tarshis, and Jeff Goldstein.[62] Dick Schneider, who directed episodes of The All-New Jeopardy!, returned as director for the Trebek version's first eight seasons. From 1992 to 2018, the show was directed by Kevin McCarthy, who had previously served as associate director under Schneider. McCarthy announced his retirement after 26 years on June 26, 2018, and was succeeded as director by Clay Jacobsen.[65]  The current version of Jeopardy! employs nine writers and five researchers to create and assemble the categories and clues.[66] Billy Wisse and Michele Loud, both longtime staff members, are the editorial producer and editorial supervisor, respectively.[67] Previous writing and editorial supervisors have included Jules Minton, Terrence McDonnell, Harry Eisenberg, and Gary Johnson.[62]  The show's production designer is Naomi Slodki.[67] Previous art directors have included Henry Lickel, Dennis Roof, Bob Rang,[62] and Ed Flesh (who also designed sets for other game shows such as The $25,000 Pyramid, Name That Tune, and Wheel of Fortune).[69]  Production [ edit ]  The daily syndicated version of Jeopardy! is produced by Sony Pictures Television (previously known as Columbia TriStar Television, the successor company to original producer Merv Griffin Enterprises).[70] The copyright holder is Jeopardy Productions, which, like SPT, operates as a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment.[71] The rights to distribute the program worldwide are owned by CBS Television Distribution, which absorbed original distributor King World Productions in 2007.[72]  The original Jeopardy! series was taped in Studio 6A at NBC Studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City,[73] and The All-New Jeopardy! was taped in Studio 3 at NBC's Burbank Studios at 3000 West Alameda Avenue in Burbank, California. The Trebek version was initially taped at Metromedia Stage 7, KTTV, on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, but moved its production facilities to Hollywood Center Studios' Stage 9 in 1985. After the final shows of season 10 were recorded on February 15, 1994, the Jeopardy! production facilities were moved to Sony Pictures Studios' Stage 10 on Washington Boulevard in Culver City, California, where the show has been recorded ever since.  Five episodes are taped each day, with two days of taping every other week.[74]  Set [ edit ]  Various sets used by the syndicated version over the years. From top to bottom: 1984–85, 1985–91, 1991–96, 1996–2002, 2002–09, and 2009–13.  Various technological and aesthetic changes have been made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!'s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount on one side and the clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall,[76] which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.[77]  From 1985 to 1997, the sets were designed to have a background color of blue for the Jeopardy! round and red for the Double Jeopardy! and Final Jeopardy! rounds. At the beginning of season 8 in 1991, a brand new set was introduced that resembled a grid. On the episode aired November 11, 1996, two months after the start of season 13, Jeopardy! introduced the first of several sets designed by Naomi Slodki, who intended the set to resemble ""the foyer of a very contemporary library, with wood and sandblasted glass and blue granite"".  Shortly after the start of season 19 in 2002, the show switched to yet another new set, which was given slight modifications when Jeopardy! and sister show Wheel of Fortune transitioned to high-definition broadcasting in 2006.[76] During this time, the show began to feature virtual tours of the set on its official web site.[80] The various HD improvements for Jeopardy! and Wheel represented a combined investment of approximately $4 million, 5,000 hours of labor, and 6 miles (9.7 km) of cable.[76] Both shows had been shot using HD cameras for several years before beginning to broadcast in HD. On standard-definition television broadcasts, the shows continue to be displayed with an aspect ratio of 4:3.  In 2009, Jeopardy! updated its set once again. The new set debuted with special episodes taped at the 42nd annual International CES technology trade show, hosted at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Winchester (Las Vegas Valley), Nevada, and became the primary set for Jeopardy! when the show began taping its 26th season, which premiered on September 14, 2009.[77] It was significantly remodeled when season 30 premiered in September 2013.[81]  Theme music [ edit ]  Since the debut of Jeopardy! in 1964, several different songs and arrangements have served as the theme music for the show, most of which were composed by Griffin. The main theme for the original Jeopardy! series was ""Take Ten"",[82] composed by Griffin's wife Julann.[83] The All-New Jeopardy! opened with ""January, February, March"" and closed with ""Frisco Disco"", both of which were composed by Griffin himself.[84]  The best-known theme song on Jeopardy! is ""Think!"", originally composed by Griffin under the title ""A Time for Tony"", as a lullaby for his son.[85] ""Think!"" has always been used for the 30-second period in Final Jeopardy! when the contestants write down their responses, and since the syndicated version debuted in 1984, a rendition of that tune has been used as the main theme song. ""Think!"" has become so popular that it has been used in many different contexts, from sporting events to weddings. Griffin estimated that the use of ""Think!"" had earned him royalties of over $70 million throughout his lifetime.[88] ""Think!"" led Griffin to win the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) President's Award in 2003,[89] and during GSN's 2009 Game Show Awards special, it was named ""Best Game Show Theme Song"".[90] In 1997, the main theme and Final Jeopardy! recordings of ""Think!"" were rearranged by Steve Kaplan, who served as the show's music director until his December 2003 death.[91] In 2008, Chris Bell Music and Sound Design overhauled the Jeopardy! music package for the show's 25th anniversary.[92]  Audition process [ edit ]  Prospective contestants of the original Jeopardy! series called the show's office in New York to arrange an appointment and to preliminarily determine eligibility. They were briefed and auditioned together in groups of ten to thirty individuals, participating in both a written test and mock games. Individuals who were successful at the audition were invited to appear on the program within approximately six weeks.  Auditioning for the current version of the show begins with a written exam, comprising fifty questions in total. This exam is administered online periodically, as well as being offered at regional contestant search events. Since season 15 (1998–99), the show has used a Winnebago recreational vehicle called the ""Jeopardy! Brain Bus"" to conduct regional events throughout the United States and Canada. Participants who correctly answer at least 35 out of 50 questions advance in the audition process and are invited to compete in mock games. Those who are approved are notified at a later time and invited to appear on the show.  Broadcast history [ edit ]  The original Jeopardy! series premiered on NBC on March 30, 1964, and by the end of the 1960s was the second-highest-rated daytime game show, behind only The Hollywood Squares. The show was successful until 1974, when Lin Bolen, then NBC's Vice President of Daytime Programming, moved the show out of the noontime slot where it had been located for most of its run, as part of her effort to boost ratings among the 18–34 female demographic. After 2,753 episodes, the original Jeopardy! series ended on January 3, 1975; to compensate Griffin for its cancellation, NBC purchased Wheel of Fortune, another show that he had created, and premiered it the following Monday. A syndicated edition of Jeopardy!, distributed by Metromedia and featuring many contestants who were previously champions on the original series, aired in the primetime during the 1974–1975 season. The NBC daytime series was later revived as The All-New Jeopardy!, which premiered on October 2, 1978[98] and aired 108 episodes, ending on March 2, 1979;[99] this revival featured significant rule changes, such as progressive elimination of contestants over the course of the main game, and a bonus round instead of Final Jeopardy!  The daily syndicated version debuted on September 10, 1984, and was launched in response to the success of the syndicated version of Wheel and the installation of electronic trivia games in pubs and bars. This version of the program has met with greater success than the previous incarnations; it has outlived 300 other game shows and become the second most popular game show in syndication (behind Wheel), averaging 25 million viewers per week. The show's most recent renewal, in May 2017, extends it through the 2019–2020 season.[51]  Jeopardy! listed in yellow (the common Arabic-language version in light yellow) Countries with versions oflisted in yellow (the common Arabic-language version in light yellow)  Jeopardy! has spawned versions in many foreign countries throughout the world, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Israel, and Australia. The American syndicated version of Jeopardy! is also broadcast throughout the world, with international distribution rights handled by CBS Studios International.[104]  Three spin-off versions of Jeopardy! have been created. Rock & Roll Jeopardy! debuted on VH1 in 1998 and ran until 2001; the show centered around post-1950s popular music trivia and was hosted by Jeff Probst. Jep!, which aired on GSN during the 1998–1999 season, was a special children's version hosted by Bob Bergen and featured various rule changes from the original version. Sports Jeopardy!, a sports-themed version hosted by Dan Patrick, premiered in 2014 on the Crackle digital service and eventually moved to the cable sports network NBCSN in 2016.[107]  Archived episodes [ edit ]  Only a small number of episodes of the first three Jeopardy! versions survive. From the original NBC daytime version, archived episodes mostly consist of black-and-white kinescopes of the original color videotapes. Various episodes from 1967, 1971, 1973, and 1974 are listed among the holdings of the UCLA Film and Television Archive.[109] The 1964 ""test episode"", Episode No. 2,000 (from February 21, 1972), and a June 1975 episode of the weekly syndicated edition exist at the Paley Center for Media.[110] Incomplete paper records of the NBC-era games exist on microfilm at the Library of Congress. GSN holds The All-New Jeopardy!'s premiere and finale in broadcast quality, and aired the latter on December 31, 1999, as part of its ""Y2Play"" marathon.[99] The UCLA Archive holds a copy of a pilot taped for CBS in 1977,[109] and the premiere exists among the Paley Center's holdings.[110]  GSN, which, like Jeopardy!, is an affiliate of Sony Pictures Television, has rerun ten seasons since the channel's launch in 1994. Copies of 43 Trebek-hosted syndicated Jeopardy! episodes aired between 1989 and 2004 have been collected by the UCLA Archive,[109] and the premiere and various other episodes are included in the Paley Center's collection.[110]  Reception [ edit ]  Alex Trebek with the Peabody Award, 2012  By 1994 the press called Jeopardy! ""an American icon"".[111] It has won a record 33 Daytime Emmy Awards since 1984.[112] The show holds the record for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show, with fifteen awards won in that category.[66] Another five awards have been won by Trebek for Outstanding Game Show Host.[66] Twelve other awards were won by the show's directors and writers in the respective categories of Outstanding Direction for a Game/Audience Participation Show and Outstanding Special Class Writing before these categories were removed in 2006. On June 17, 2011, Trebek shared the Lifetime Achievement Award with Sajak at the 38th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony.[113] The following year, the show was honored with a Peabody Award for its role in encouraging, celebrating, and rewarding knowledge.[114]  In its April 17–23, 1993 issue, TV Guide named Jeopardy! the best game show of the 1970s as part of a celebration of its 40th anniversary.[115] In January 2001, the magazine ranked the show number 2 on its ""50 Greatest Game Shows"" list—second only to The Price Is Right.[116] It would later rank Jeopardy! number 45 on its list of the 60 Best TV Series of All Time, calling it ""habit-forming"" and saying that the program ""always makes [its viewers] feel smarter"".[117] Also in 2013, the show ranked number 1 on TV Guide's list of the 60 Greatest Game Shows.[118] In the summer of 2006, the show was ranked number 2 on GSN's list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time, second only to Match Game.[119]  A hall of fame honoring Jeopardy! was added to the Sony Pictures Studios tour on September 20, 2011. It features the show's Emmy Awards as well as retired set pieces, classic merchandise, video clips, photographs, and other memorabilia related to Jeopardy!'s history.[120]  In 1989, Fleming expressed dissatisfaction with the daily syndicated Jeopardy! series in an essay published in Sports Illustrated. He confessed that he only watched the Trebek version infrequently, and then only for a handful of questions; and also criticized this new iteration mainly for its Hollywood setting. Fleming believed that, in contrast to New Yorkers who Fleming considered to be more intelligent and authentic, moving the show to Hollywood brought both an unrealistic glamour and a dumbing-down of the program that he disdained. He also disliked the decision to not award losing contestants their cash earnings (believing the parting gifts offered instead to be cheap) and expressed surprise that what he considered to be a parlor game had transformed into such a national phenomenon under Trebek.[121]  Jeopardy!'s answer-and-question format has become widely entrenched: Fleming observed that other game shows would have contestants phrasing their answers in question form, leading hosts to remind them that they are not competing on Jeopardy!  Tournaments and other events [ edit ]  Regular events [ edit ]  Starting in 1985, the show has held an annual Tournament of Champions featuring the top fifteen champions who have appeared on the show since the last tournament. The top prize awarded to the winner was originally valued at $100,000, and increased to $250,000 in 2003.[123] Other regular tournaments include the Teen Tournament, with a $100,000 top prize;[104] the College Championship, in which undergraduate students from American colleges and universities compete for a $100,000 top prize; and the Teachers Tournament, where educators compete for a $100,000 top prize.[124] Each tournament runs for ten consecutive episodes in a format devised by Trebek himself, consisting of five quarter-final games, three semifinals, and a final consisting of two games with the scores totaled. Winners of the College Championship and Teachers Tournament are invited to participate in the Tournament of Champions.  Non-tournament events held regularly on the show include Celebrity Jeopardy!, in which celebrities and other notable individuals compete for charitable organizations of their choice; and Kids Week, a special competition for school-age children aged 10 through 12.[126]  Special events [ edit ]  Three International Tournaments, held in 1996, 1997, and 2001, featured one-week competitions among champions from each of the international versions of Jeopardy!. Each of the countries that aired their own version of the show in those years could nominate a contestant. The format was identical to the semifinals and finals of other Jeopardy! tournaments. In 1996 and 1997, the winner received $25,000; in 2001, the top prize was doubled to $50,000. The 1997 tournament was recorded in Stockholm on the set of the Swedish version of Jeopardy!, and is significant for being the first week of Jeopardy! episodes to be taped in a foreign country.  There have been a number of special tournaments featuring the greatest contestants in Jeopardy! history. The first of these ""all-time best"" tournaments, Super Jeopardy!, aired in the summer of 1990 on ABC, and featured 35 top contestants from the previous seasons of the Trebek version and one notable champion from the original Jeopardy! series competing for a top prize of $250,000. In 1993, that year's Tournament of Champions was followed by a Tenth Anniversary Tournament conducted over five episodes. In May 2002, to commemorate the Trebek version's 4,000th episode, the show invited fifteen champions to play for a $1 million prize in the Million Dollar Masters tournament, which took place at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The Ultimate Tournament of Champions aired in 2005 and pitted 145 former Jeopardy! champions against each other, with two winners moving on to face Ken Jennings in a three-game final for $2,000,000, the largest prize in the show's history; overall, the tournament spanned 15 weeks and 76 episodes, starting on February 9 and ending on May 25.[129] In 2014, Jeopardy! commemorated the 30th anniversary of the Trebek version with a Battle of the Decades tournament, in which 15 champions apiece from the first, second, and third decades of Jeopardy!'s daily syndicated history competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000.[130]  In November 1998, Jeopardy! traveled to Boston to reassemble 12 past Teen Tournament contestants for a special Teen Reunion Tournament. In 2008, the 25th season began with reuniting 15 contestants from the first two Kids Weeks to compete in a special reunion tournament of their own.[131] During the next season (2009–2010), a special edition of Celebrity Jeopardy!, called the Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational, was played in which twenty-seven contestants from past celebrity episodes competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000 for charity; the grand prize was won by Michael McKean.[132]  The IBM Challenge aired February 14–16, 2011, and featured IBM's Watson computer facing off against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a two-game match played over three shows.[133] This was the first man-vs.-machine competition in Jeopardy!'s history.[134] Watson won both the first game and the overall match to win the grand prize of $1 million, which IBM divided between two charities (World Vision International and World Community Grid).[135] Jennings, who won $300,000 for second place, and Rutter, who won the $200,000 third-place prize, both pledged to donate half of their winnings to charity.[136] The competition brought the show its highest ratings since the Ultimate Tournament of Champions.[137]  Record holders [ edit ]  Jeopardy!'s record for the longest winning streak is held by Ken Jennings, who competed on the show from June 2 through November 30, 2004, winning 74 matches before being defeated by Nancy Zerg in his 75th appearance. He amassed $2,520,700 over his 74 wins and a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance. At the time, he held the record as the highest money-winner ever on American game shows, and his winning streak increased the show's ratings and popularity to the point where it became TV's highest-rated syndicated program.[138] Jennings later won the $500,000 second-place prize in the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions, the $300,000 second-place prize in the IBM Challenge, and the $100,000 second-place prize in the Battle of the Decades.  The highest-earning all-time Jeopardy! contestant is Brad Rutter, who has won a cumulative total of $4,355,102.[139] He became an undefeated champion in 2000 and later won an unprecedented four Jeopardy! tournaments: the 2001 Tournament of Champions,[140] the 2002 Million Dollar Masters Tournament, the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions,[141] and the 2014 Battle of the Decades. Rutter broke Jennings's record for all-time game show winnings when he defeated Jennings and Jerome Vered in the Ultimate Tournament of Champions finals. Jennings regained the record through appearances on various other game shows, culminating in an appearance on Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? on October 10, 2008. In 2014, Rutter regained the title after winning $1,000,000 in the Battle of the Decades, defeating Jennings and Roger Craig in the finals.  Craig is the holder of the all-time record for single-day winnings on Jeopardy!. On the episode that aired September 14, 2010, he amassed a score of $47,000 after the game's first two rounds, then wagered and won an additional $30,000 in the Final Jeopardy! round, finishing with $77,000. The previous single-day record of $75,000 had been set by Jennings.[142]  The record-holder among female contestants on Jeopardy!—in both number of games and total winnings—is Julia Collins, who amassed $429,100 over 21 games between April 21 and June 2, 2014. She won $428,100 in her 20 games as champion, plus $1,000 for finishing third in her twenty-first game.[143] Collins also achieved the second-longest winning streak on the show, behind Jennings. The streak, which was interrupted in May by the Battle of the Decades, was broken by Brian Loughnane.[144][145]  The highest single-day winnings in a Celebrity Jeopardy! tournament was achieved by comedian Andy Richter during a first-round game of the 2009–2010 season's ""Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational"", in which he finished with $68,000 for his selected charity, the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.[146]  Four contestants on the Trebek version have won a game with the lowest amount possible ($1). The first was U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Darryl Scott, on the episode that aired January 19, 1993;[147][148] the second was Benjamin Salisbury, on a Celebrity Jeopardy! episode that aired April 30, 1997;[149] the third was Brandi Chastain, on the Celebrity Jeopardy! episode that aired February 9, 2001;[150] and the fourth was U.S. Navy Lieutenant Manny Abell, on the episode that aired October 17, 2017.[148]  Other media [ edit ]  Portrayals and parodies [ edit ]  Jeopardy! has been featured in a number of films, television shows and books over the years, mostly with one or more characters participating as contestants, or viewing and interacting with the game show from their own homes.  Merchandise [ edit ]  Over the years, the Jeopardy! brand has been licensed for various products. From 1964 through 1976, Milton Bradley issued annual board games based on the original Fleming version. The Trebek version has been adapted into board games released by Pressman Toy Corporation, Tyco Toys, and Parker Brothers.[165] In addition, Jeopardy! has been adapted into a number of video games released on various consoles and handhelds spanning multiple hardware generations, starting with a Nintendo Entertainment System game released in 1987.[166] The show has also been adapted for personal computers (starting in 1987 with Apple II, Commodore 64, and DOS versions[167]), Facebook,[168] Twitter, Android, and the Roku Channel Store.[169]  A DVD titled Jeopardy!: An Inside Look at America's Favorite Quiz Show, released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on November 8, 2005, features five memorable episodes of the Trebek version (the 1984 premiere, Jennings' final game, and the three finals matches of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions)[170] and three featurettes discussing the show's history and question selection process.[171] Other products featuring the Jeopardy! brand include a collectible watch, a series of daily desktop calendars, and various slot machine games for casinos and the Internet.  Internet [ edit ]  Jeopardy!'s official website, active as early as 1998,[172] receives over 400,000 monthly visitors. The website features videos, photographs, and other information related to each week's contestants, as well as mini-sites promoting remote tapings and special tournaments. As the show changes its main title card and corresponding graphics with every passing season, the Jeopardy! website is re-skinned to reflect the changes, and the general content of the site (such as online tests and promotions, programming announcements, ""spotlight"" segments, photo galleries, and downloadable content) is regularly updated to align with producers' priorities for the show.[174] In its 2012 ""Readers Choice Awards"", About.com praised the official Jeopardy! website for featuring ""everything [visitors] need to know about the show, as well as some fun interactive elements"", and for having a humorous error page.[175]  In November 2009, Jeopardy! launched a viewer loyalty program called the ""Jeopardy! Premier Club"", which allowed home viewers to identify Final Jeopardy! categories from episodes for a chance to earn points, and play a weekly Jeopardy! game featuring categories and clues from the previous week's episodes. Every three months, contestants were selected randomly to advance to one of three quarterly online tournaments; after these tournaments were played, the three highest scoring contestants would play one final online tournament for the chance to win $5,000 and a trip to Los Angeles to attend a taping of Jeopardy![176] The Premier Club was discontinued by July 2011.[177]  There is an unofficial Jeopardy! fansite known as the ""J! Archive"" (j-archive.com), which transcribes games from throughout Jeopardy!'s daily syndicated history. In the archive, episodes are covered by Jeopardy!-style game boards with panels which, when hovered over with a mouse, reveal the correct response to their corresponding clues and the contestant who gave the correct response. The site makes use of a ""wagering calculator"" that helps potential contestants determine what amount is safest to bet during Final Jeopardy!, and an alternative scoring method called ""Coryat scoring"" that disregards wagering during Daily Doubles or Final Jeopardy! and gauges one's general strength at the game. The site's main founding archivist is Robert Knecht Schmidt, a student from Cleveland, Ohio,[178] who himself appeared as a Jeopardy! contestant in March 2010.[179] Before J! Archive, there was an earlier Jeopardy! fansite known as the ""Jeoparchive"", created by season 19 contestant Ronnie O'Rourke, who managed and updated the site until Jennings's run made her disillusioned with the show.[178]  References [ edit ]",0
"Prince George is getting heightened security at school and around London after being targeted by an ISIS threat, TMZ reports. There will reportedly be ""beefed up"" security at his school, St. Thomas's Battersea, and more officers will accompany him and his grandmother, Carole Middleton (Kate's mom), during their outings together.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Two weeks ago, an alleged supporter of the Islamic State group went on trial in London, accused of encouraging attacks on the four-year-old prince. Prosecutors said Husnain Rashid—a 32-year-old former mosque teacher in northwest England—provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"" and encouraged attacks on a range of targets, including ""injecting poison into supermarket ice creams and targeting Prince George at his first school.""  The Guardian reports that one of Rashid's posts included a photo of George, his school, and the message, ""Even the royal family will not be left alone."" Last week, after previously saying he did nothing wrong, Rashid admitted to a number of terror offenses, including encouraging terrorism, according to CNN.  Getty Images  Prince George—the eldest child of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and third in line for the throne—was recently seen at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding on May 19, where he served as a page boy. He was more recently spotted with his mother and sister, Princess Charlotte, for an outing in Norfolk, England, last week.  According to TMZ, Prince George's next appearance will be at Trooping the Colour on Sunday with the rest of the royal family at Buckingham Palace. As expected, there'll be a ""bigger security presence than usual,"" according to the site.  The royal family is choosing not to lay low or retreat in the wake of the ISIS threat, a source close to the family told TMZ.  Additional reporting from Associated Press.",0
"If Bachelor Nation couples take nothing else away from going through the experience of being on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, then maybe they can just appreciate the gift of amazing engagement rings that are of no cost to them or their partners. For years, Neil Lane has been the prime source for the franchise’s engagement rings and that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. So, how much was Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette?  ABC spared no expense for true love and for Season 13, it was the same deal, even though it’s not confirmed if Neil Lane gifts the show with his rings for the publicity or if ABC busts out some hefty petty cash for them each season. Despite Rachel preferring a plain wedding band over a big old rock, she described another version of her dream ring and Bryan was able to pick one out from Lane’s selection, as per usual. And, like always, it didn’t come cheap.  According to E! News, Rachel's three-carat pear-shaped diamond ring cost more than $100,000, making it one of the more expensive engagement rings in Bachelor Nation history.  Luckily, the suitors are never expected to foot the bill for the engagement rings, which is probably a good thing since in the past, they’ve cost a pretty penny. During Season 17 of The Bachelor, Sean Lowe gave Catherine Giudici an engagement ring that was more than three carats and retails for around $75,000. Season 19’s Chris Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff with a 4-carat Neil Lane ring that reportedly cost $92,000.  Although The Bachelorette engagement rings are pretty much the cream of the crop, they’re also, for all intents and purposes, on loan to contestants. For all rings in Bachelor Nation, unless purchased by one of the contestants personally and not received through the Neil Lane arrangement, it’s in the contestants’ contracts that they must remain in their relationship for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. If they’re lucky enough to last as a couple outside of The Bachelorette and Bachelor bubble, then they get to keep their Neil Lane bling and live happily ever after in wedded Bachelor Nation bliss.  Even though some of The Bachelorette contestants this season were doctors and lawyers, who’s going to turn down the allure of a free and clear Neil Lane diamond, right? Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette is blingy for sure, but without being flashy or too over the top and I’d expect nothing less from someone who is already a Bachelorette favorite for so many fans.

"Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus have broken up after over a year of dating, a source tells ET.  “They really tried to make it work and they just couldn’t right now,” the source says. “Their families came first, but ultimately having a bi-coastal relationship was difficult. They’re amicable.”  The news comes after the 46-year-old actor has been snapped two times with 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton, sparking romance rumors. On Sunday, the two were all smiles going through a Jack In the Box drive-thru in Los Angeles, and last Thursday night, they were photographed leaving Nobu Malibu together.  Another source, who is close to Sexton, tells ET that Affleck and Sexton are currently “having fun, it’s light,” noting that the couple just recently met.  ET has reached out to Affleck's rep for comment.  Meanwhile, Shookus has since deleted her Instagram account. Shookus and Affleck were last spotted together in June, when they enjoyed dinner with her parents in Santa Monica, California.  One month prior, the 38-year-old Saturday Night Live producer opened up to Elle magazine about the scrutiny their relationship faced after his split from Jennifer Garner following 10 years of marriage.  ""It’s strange to me,"" Shookus said of her newfound notoriety. “My entire career has been behind the camera, and that’s definitely where I’m most comfortable. I’m a producer, I’m a mom, a friend. Being considered a public figure honestly makes me laugh.""  Meanwhile, Affleck and Garner are still legally married. The two announced their separation in 2015, and filed for divorce last April. But earlier this month, ET learned that a judge in the L.A. County Superior Court sent a document to the actress informing her that the final judgment has not been filed and entered. According to the court document, it's her third notice of case review, and if she fails to take action fast, the court will dismiss the case for delay in prosecution.  Affleck and Garner share three children together -- Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6 -- and clearly still remain on good terms. In June, Garner Instagrammed a sweet Father's Day post dedicated to Affleck, praising him for being a great dad.

"Ed Sheeran Reveals 'Love Yourself' Was Originally Written For His New Album 'Divide'  It's no secret that Ed Sheeran had a hand in writing Justin Bieber's megahit ""Love Yourself,"" but the British singer-songwriter recently revealed that the Biebs actually wasn't the original artist in mind when he penned it. Without Bieber, though, the chart-topping tune would still be nonexistent -- or may have never even come to fruition.  “That was a song I had written for Divide. It just wouldn’t have made it,"" Sheeran explained in an interview with Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio Monday morning (Jan. 9). ""And then Justin took it and did his thing on it, and released it as a single and made it what it is. So going from a song that would have never been released to [being] the biggest song of last year -- it just became Billboard's #1 of 2016 of the whole year, and [was] nominated for Song of the Year at the GRAMMYs -- it just shows you that you shouldn’t always write stuff off.”  Sheeran didn't elaborate on what kind of touch Bieber had on the song, but he made sure to give the Purpose singer some credit. ""[Justin] did have input on it, I wouldn’t say it was just all me.""  Those who pay close attention to Bieber's Twitter may have noticed that Sheeran also had a role in another one of the Bieb's 2016 hits: the Major Lazer/MØ collaboration ""Cold Water."" But before Sheeran actually heard the track, he didn't realize he had written yet another smash for Bieber.  “‘Cold Water’ was a weird one because I didn’t even know that song existed,” he explained. “It was a song I must’ve half-written somewhere at a time where I was writing a lot of songs and I did it at Benny Blanco’s house and then I got an email from Diplo just being like, ‘Yo! That ‘Cold Water’ song is dope! Can I have it?’ And I was like, ‘I have no idea what you’re talking about,’ so I just didn’t reply. And then he emailed and was like, “Yo, Justin [Bieber] wants to hop on the ‘Cold Water’ song. Is that cool?’ And I’m just like, ‘What are you talking about?’... And then the song came out and it was number one and I was like ‘Oh, that song!’ I remember doing it, but it was really, really slow. I remember hearing it and being like ‘That kind of sounds like me. Oh wait, it was me.'""  While fans may never get to hear Sheeran's versions of ""Cold Water"" or ""Love Yourself"" -- though he did give one live performance of the latter in December -- they did get a sneak peak last week of what's to come with Divide. Sheeran released ""Castle on the Hill,"" an homage to his hometown of Suffolk, England, and the sexually charged ""Shape of You,"" which both shot to the top of iTunes on Friday (Jan. 6), and set a Spotify record in their first 24 hours of release.  Sheeran revealed on Jan. 12 that Divide will be dropping March 3, and has previously said that he will be sharing a few more new tunes from the LP prior to its release.

But unfortunately for Kristen, life doesn’t have the ctrl+z option so she’s stuck with any mistakes she (might) have made – and embarrassing things she might have said.  Just one month before she was exposed as a cheat with Rupert Sanders, she revealed that she wants to have babies with her long-term boyfriend R-Pattz.  In an un-guarded moment, she told Vogue journalist Christa D’Souza: ""My God, I'm so in love with my boyfriend. I wish he were here now. I think I want to have his babies.""  Before adding: “I love the way he smells. And him me. Like, he loves to lick under my armpits.”  While it’s ultimately quite a gross thing to say, it proves that Rob found Kristen so amazing he was happy to lick her sweaty pits. But he’s not the only person to think his Twilight co-star is, er, flawless.  Rupert describes Kristen, 22, as ""amazing"" and ""flawless"" in the voiceover on the Snow White and the Huntsman DVD director's commentary.  It’s a fair assumption this was filmed before his fling with K-Stew became world (and wife Liberty Ross) knowledge.  (Image: Getty)  Before the affair, Rupert was asked whether Kristen and Liberty – who also featured in the movie – were friends.  He replied: ""She and Liberty didn't have very many scenes together, so they didn't get to know each other that well. But they definitely have similarities. There's a look they share.""  Yesterday, Kristen wore Rob's t-shirt which had the word IRIE printed on the front when she arrived in Toronto for the film festival.  And if you didn't know what that means, it stands for ‘the way you feel when you have no worries – to be at total peace with your current state of being’.  We feel a bit like Sherlock Holmes piecing together the hidden flirty messages.

"The reality star and her husband are slapped with a tax lien by the state of California.

"BREAKING: Barack Obama just secretly fled the U.S. after Donald Trump found some disturbing criminal evidence he left behind in the Oval Office. This prompted Trump to send a massive warning to Obama and his deep state minions that they won’t soon forget!Mad World News reported that Obama just jetted off to New Zealand this week, and he immediately imposed a strict ban on the media covering the events he plans to hold there. It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.In the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn’t cover their tracks well enough.The members of Obama’s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the “Presidential Daily Briefings” (PDB).“During the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the ‘small group’ collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.Nunes eventually found Obama’s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.“Nunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was ‘not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.’ So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.These PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn’t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called “National Security Action,” who says their mission is, “Under President Trump’s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America’s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.”These people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it. Unfortunately for them, however, McCabe’s firing makes it clear that they won’t get away with this act of treason.What do you think about this? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.",1
"Chris Rock reportedly upset a significant group of his fan base as he allegedly made comments joking about sexual harassment in one of his recent stand-up performances.  According to Page Six, during his performance at the Comedy Cellar, Rock explained that he refused to hire women because ""they cry rape because they want money.""  One patron who attended the gig spoke with the publication and added more context to the reports, saying that Rock joked that he would need a crew of witnesses surrounding him at all times to prevent him from falling victim to false rape allegations.  His comments didn't sit well with a few of his fans as another attendee added, ""I've seen him before and he was hysterical, but this wasn't funny at all... Nobody was laughing.

"The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11]  Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29]  To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31]  Wedding [ edit ]  Planning [ edit ]  Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.  Venue [ edit ]  The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36]  Cost [ edit ]  The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering had been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost was expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs were expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] By the end of May, it was estimated that the security costs were ""between £2 million and £4 million"". The police and crime commissioner could also apply for special funding if the costs were to exceed 1% of the Thames Valley Police force's annual budget, but at the time the cost was ""well below the £4 million required to make a claim"".[41] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It was predicted that the wedding would trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[42]  Wedding attire [ edit ]  The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit""; for women, ""Day Dress and Hat"".[43]  Bride and bridesmaids [ edit ]  The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[44] It was made of ""double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza"" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[45][46] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[45][47] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[48] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[45][49] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[50] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[45]  Other ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[45][49][51] Markle's hair was rolled up with ""face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears"",[52] and was done by Serge Normant.[53] Make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle's makeup for the occasion.[52][54] The look was described as ""a soft brown eyeshadow"" with minimal makeup on the face.[52] Her nails were painted in a ""neutral pink-y beige"" for the ceremony.[55] The bride's bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained ""forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle"".[45] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[45][56] After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[57] For the customary bridal themes of ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue"", Markle had her gown and veil (the ""new""), the Queen's tiara (the ""borrowed""), sprigs of myrtle taken from ""a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet"" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown (the ""old""), and finally a piece of fabric from the dress she wore on their first date stitched in the veil (the ""blue"").[58][59][60] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[61]  Groom, best man and page boys [ edit ]  Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 3] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[62] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman's tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[63][64] The groom asked for and received the Queen's permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[62] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[65] Prince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[63][66] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[63]  Wedding party [ edit ]  On 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[67][68] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[69] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[70]  There were suggestions that the bride's friend Jessica Mulroney would be her maid of honour.[71][72] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[73] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle's godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Ritt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[74][75]  On 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[76][77] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[78][79] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[80]  Approximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[81]  Wedding service [ edit ]  The wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[3]  From 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[84] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[85] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[86][87]  Prince Harry's maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[88][89] Curry's 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love;[90][91] its unexpected length caused the service to overrun by eight minutes.[92] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[93]  The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to ""to love and to cherish"" each other.[94] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[94] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum.[95] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[96] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[94] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[97]  Music [ edit ]  Hymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[98] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[99] it was also the opening hymn to William's wedding in 2011.  Two choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George's Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang ""Stand By Me"" in what was described as ""an incredible and powerful moment"".[100] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[101] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel's Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[102][103]  The bride walked down the aisle to ""Eternal source of light divine"" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[104] Other music during the service included the motet ""If Ye Love Me"" by Thomas Tallis; the song ""Stand by Me"" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and ""The Lord bless you and keep you"" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Fauré's Après un rêve, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert's Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and ""This Little Light of Mine"" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[105]  Family celebrations [ edit ]  St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House  Following the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George's Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[62] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[88] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, with left-hand drive. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[106][107] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[107] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[62] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man's speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[108][109][110] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[111]  The wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[112] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[113]  Three official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[114]  Guests [ edit ]  In April 2018, it was announced that an ""official list"" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama were also not invited.[115] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry's elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[116] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry's position as sixth in line to the throne.[116] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was ""a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother"".[62]  With a smaller ceremony and reception at St George's Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a ""direct relationship"" with the couple.[117] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[118] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[117] The invitees outside the chapel were ""people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children"".[119]  Sarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly ""deeply upset"" by her omission.[120]  Amongst the non-royal guests were Markle's Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Megan's close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[121][122][123][124][125]  The only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry's friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[126]  Gifts for guests [ edit ]  The 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[127]  Charitable donations [ edit ]  In April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[128][129]  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.  Crisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.  The Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.  Scotty's Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.  StreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.  Surfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.  The Wilderness Foundation UK: Vulnerable teenagers from urban communities are taught about the great outdoors and rural employment opportunities.

ABC began its coverage at 5 a.m. EDT with a special edition of Good Morning America.[143] NBC aired the ceremony at 4:30 a.m. EDT with a special edition of The Today Show.[144] The pay subscription network HBO hosted a live broadcast titled ""The Royal Wedding Live with Cord and Tish!"" starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT.[145] The parody hosts were Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan, the alter egos of former Saturday Night Live actors Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon. BBC America provided a live simulcast of BBC One's coverage, albeit with limited commercial breaks.[146]  The wedding was also aired on the Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ.[147]  Comments in a ""posh"" British accent by a self-claimed British expert on some media turned out to be by an American, Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills.[148]  Titles [ edit ]  Traditionally, royal princes have been awarded peerages prior to their marriages; this occurred with both of Prince Harry's uncles, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, as well as his elder brother, the Duke of Cambridge.[149] Hours before the wedding, Prince Harry was granted the titles Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel, and Markle assumed the style ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex"" upon marriage.[1]  Reactions [ edit ]  British reactions to a mixed-race American marrying into the British royal family ( Voice of America  The wedding was widely reported as being significant for its departure from tradition typically associated with the Royal Family and for its inclusion of African-American culture in the service.[150][151][152][153][154] It was described as a ""landmark for African Americans"", for Black British, black and mixed-race women, and for the Royal Family itself.[155][156][157][158] Other reports cited more limited impact, including that ""Markle being biracial as opposed to African American impeded black people embracing her as one of their own"".[159][160]  The wedding, particularly Markle's choice of dress, as well as the cake and flowers, influenced the choices of other British brides for their weddings.[161]  Honeymoon [ edit ]  The couple did not leave for their honeymoon the day after their marriage, and were both scheduled to carry out public engagements in the week after the wedding.[162] The location of the honeymoon has been kept secret, although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as Namibia, Rwanda, and Botswana.[163][164][165]  See also [ edit ]",0

"Save for dermatologists, there are seldom folks who are as knowledgeable about the inner workings of our epidermis as aestheticians. Like doctors, they've seen it all: acne, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and rosacea. The main difference is you're probably not going to book a facial if you're having an eczema flare-up. While facialists certainly see their fair share of skin concerns, it's their job not to prescribe drugs, but rather to provide treatments that help soothe and transform the skin over time. What's more: Said treatments are usually super tranquil and administered on a sleep-inducing spa table.  Aside from the relaxation factor, another tempting reason to see a facialist (interchangably called aesthetician), is the personalized approach. Most of the time these complexion caregivers work by meticulously examining your skin and treating it with whatever it needs, whether it's a heavy dose of hydration, uncomfortable extractions, or a dose of LED light therapy. Celebrities, bloggers, and beauty editors (not to mention everyday folks who crave a clear complexion) rely on aestheticians for balanced, soothed skin that glows — without the highlighter.  But, I wonder: How do these skin whisperers care for their own complexions? Because I couldn't shake the curiosity, I decided to ask. Ahead, find the skin-care routines and secrets of six top facialists.  Courtesy of Angela Caglia/Brittany Theophilus  Morning:  The Hollywood-based facialist and founder of Angela Caglia Skincare prides herself on being a green beauty expert and follows a skin-care meets self-love approach whenever she can.  ""Every day I wake up and go to my fridge to take out my rose quartz roller, which I love to gently roll on my face to stimulate blood flow and assist with lymphatic drainage. It instantly alleviates puffiness and dark circles,"" she says of the first step to her morning routine. ""The energy of the rose quartz is the perfect self-love ritual to start my busy day.""  Next up, Caglia rinses her face with not warm or tepid, but cold water to further refresh her complexion — no cleanser needed. ""Usually then I'll just apply Suntegrity Moisturizer or I also love the French pharmacy brand La-Roche Posay's Anthelious AC; they're both light and make my skin happy, while being protected,"" she says. (Spoiler alert: She says she's working on an SPF formulation for her own line as we speak.)  Night:  Believe it or not, Caglia's p.m. skin-care routine is just as streamlined as her a.m. regimen. She generally sticks to removing any makeup and grime from the day with her Power Cleansing Balm, which she says she uses as a cleanser, mask, and moisturizer as she specifically created it to be a multifunctional product. When her skin requires some extra TLC, she turns to Glam Glow's YouthMud for a deep exfoliation prior to moisturizing. And when she has the time, she loves to give herself high-tech facials and treatments like LED light therapy. ""Usually I'm so busy doing all of my clients, but I try to do it every few weeks,"" she says.  The extras:  Caglia is a fervent believer that what you put into your body shows up on your skin. ""I love to eat and drink foods that are great for your skin, so I'll snack on blueberries for the antioxidants, which help protect and brighten my skin, salmon because it's high in omegas and helps keep my skin glow-y, and a daily green drink to keep it clear.""  Courtesy of Melissa Haloossim/Brittany Theophilus  Morning:  Melissa Haloossim, aka Kim Kardashian's late-night skin savior, follows a no-fuss approach in the a.m., too. She starts by rinsing her face with cool water before applying SkinMedica's HA5 Serum, which supports the skin's own ability to replenish hyaluronic acid. She's another no-cleanser-in-the-morning advocate, as she says doing this too often can dry the skin.",0
"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are no longer sleeping in the same bed, RadarOnline.com can reveal.  The news comes as a blow after they called off a potential divorce earlier this summer, and had been doing couple’s therapy.  An insider told Radar: “Kim booted Kanye to the spare room blaming his snoring, but there’s way more to it than that.”  PHOTOS: Kanye West Meets With Donald Trump After Major Meltdown  “The truth is that they’ve lost that spark and never recovered it.

"It's been a pretty surprising last few days for fans of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, AKA Jelena. Many rooting for the on-again, off-again couple to get back together once and for all are probably just a tad bit shattered now that it's been confirmed that Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are engaged to be married after Bieber's proposal on July 7 during a trip to the Bahamas. But, while we're all over here mourning the loss of the couple that we thought would be endgame, our girl Selena is literally the epitome of the shrugged-shoulders emoji, clearly not caring as much as we all thought she would. And honestly, Selena Gomez's reaction to Justin Bieber's engagement confirmation will probably make you love her even more than you already do, if that's possible.  According to E! News, a source told the publication that, although the news of Bieber and Baldwin's engagement was unexpected, Gomez ""doesn't really care"" about her ex-boyfriend's new romance. The source said,  Selena was surprised an engagement happened this quickly but not surprised Justin would do something like this knowing who he is. At the end of the day though she doesn't really care. Selena is totally over him. She had tried again to make it work that last time and it didn't work out.  Elite Daily reached out to Gomez's team regarding the report, but has not heard back by the time of publication.  Le sigh. For everyone who knew Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's relationship, it's a bit sad to hear that these two clearly aren't getting back together, but perhaps that's for the best, considering they are in completely different phases of their lives right now.  Craig Barritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The source continued, saying, ""Selena is definitely on a different path right now and in a much better place since Justin is out of the picture. Mentally, she is done with him,"" adding that ""she isn't focused on dating as much as she's just really focusing on herself. She's happy right now just spending time with her girlfriends and going to church.""  Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  A second source also noted that Gomez is putting her relationship with her ex-boyfriend ""in the past,"" adding that while she's ""very shocked"" to hear about Bieber's whirlwind engagement, she simply ""doesn't care.""  Yasss, girl!  ""Selena knows that Justin makes rash decisions, but wishes them both the best. She is truly focused on herself and Justin is no longer a topic of conversation in her life,"" the second source told E! News.  Sorry, Justin. Looks like our girl is just as over you as you are with her.  On July 10, just days after Bieber's engagement was confirmed, Gomez was seen in New York City wearing gray sweatpants and a black T-shirt that said, ""only the strong survive,"" and let me tell you, it is a mood and I am feeling it. While some might say that this is her way of telling the world that she's a fierce warrior in the midst of all the engagement hubbub, let's be honest: we already knew that.  And, considering that we saw her without a care in the world shortly after the news of the engagement actually broke, methinks that she's doing juuuust fine.  On Sunday, July 8, Gomez's friend and assistant, Theresa Mingus, posted a photo to Instagram showing herself and Gomez hanging out on a yacht, looking like they were living their best life (because spoiler alert: if you're on a yacht, you are UNDOUBTEDLY doing just that):  So c'mon, fam. It looks like Bieber's quite smitten with Baldwin, and Gomez is living it up with friends and enjoying being single, so I think it's time we give Jelena a rest and set our sights on Jailey.  Maybe it's not what we anticipated the outcome would be for this love triangle, but let's work with what we've got and be happy that everyone involved is happy — or seems to be, at the very least.  Let's all give a big congrats to the happy couple, and an even bigger applause to Selena. You do you, boo!",1
"Steven Bochco, a producer whose boundary-pushing series such as “Hill Street Blues” and “NYPD Blue” helped define the modern TV drama, has died. He was 74.  Bochco had been battling a rare form of leukemia for several years. He had a transplant in late 2014 that was credited with prolonging his life. A family spokesman told the Associated Press that he died in his sleep on Sunday after a battle with cancer, but did not release details of a memorial service.  Working with different collaborators, Bochco co-created some of TV’s most popular series for more than 20 years while helping to create the template for modern hourlongs featuring large ensemble casts, serialized storylines and edgy content.  The recipient of numerous industry awards, including the Humanitas Prize and Peabody honors, Bochco was nominated for an Emmy 30 times in his capacities as producer and writer, winning 10.  On “NYPD Blue,” he consciously set out to expand the parameters of what was acceptable on broadcast television, and he recalled sitting with then-ABC Entertainment chief Robert Iger — who went on to become CEO of the Walt Disney Co. — drawing naked figures, determining exactly how much of the body could be shown.  Related 'NYPD Blue' Follow-Up Series Lands Pilot Production Commitment at ABC 'NYPD Blue' at 25: Dennis Franz, Amy Brenneman, Gordon Clapp Reflect on Legacy  Bochco launched such series as “Hill Street Blues” — a ground-breaking, Emmy-winning cop show — and “L.A. Law” for NBC before entering into a landmark 10-series deal with ABC in the late 1980s. The relationship produced some clear hits (“NYPD Blue,” “Doogie Howser, M.D.”) and notable failures, including the musical police drama “Cop Rock” and the serialized courtroom drama “Murder One,” which followed a single murder trial over an entire season. As virtual proof the latter was ahead of its time, Bochco essentially revived it in 2014, under the title “Murder in the First,” for TNT, where it ran for three years.  Asked how he could risk gambling on a musical like “Cop Rock” given the richness of his ABC pact, Bochco once joked, “With my deal, how could I not?”  Bochco wasn’t above engaging in public spats and power struggles, from complaining about his treatment by network executives to tussling with recalcitrant stars. In one of the highest-profile tiffs, his rift with David Caruso during the first season of “NYPD Blue” led to the actor’s exit, a considerable gamble for a series in its first season. Bochco replaced him with former “L.A. Law” co-star Jimmy Smits, and the program went on to run for 11 years.  Although Bochco often consciously pressed against boundaries and seemed to delight in testing censors, he recalled that the breakthrough storytelling style of “Hill Street” was born more out of necessity than design.  “We had so many characters that we realized we couldn’t service 10 or 11 characters within the confines of a single episode, so the only way that we could really do justice to the size of the world was by creating storylines that spilled over the margins,” he told the New York Times.  The producer also had a way of celebrating even his failures. When “Cop Rock” came to an end after a mere 11 episodes, what turned out to be the final episode incorporated a musical sequence where a fat lady literally sang, signaling its cancellation.  Bochco also appeared to relish nettling his critics, saying that the pressure campaign waged against “NYPD Blue” – which helped prompt dozens of stations not to air the show when it premiered – ultimately helped promote the series and turned it into a hit.  Steven Ronald Bochco was born in New York, the son of a violin virtuoso (which inspired his production company’s onscreen logo). He attended NYU and subsequently Carnegie Institute of Technology, receiving a degree in theater.  He started his writing career in the 1960s. Credits included “Columbo,” with an episode directed by Steven Spielberg, who also came up through the ranks at Universal Television.  Bochco wrote such features as “The Movie Maker” and “Silent Running” before he began to steadfastly focus on television and create his own shows, including “Delvecchio,” a drama starring Judd Hirsch. Later came “Bay City Blues,” about a baseball team, which didn’t last.  With “Hill Street Blues,” Bochco and co-creator Michael Kozoll broke the dramatic mold, featuring a huge ensemble cast and gritty narrative while juggling various subplots. NBC was in the ratings cellar at the time, but its patience with prestige programs like “Hill Street” and “Cheers” was rewarded after “The Cosby Show” premiered in 1984, turning its Thursday lineup into a ratings juggernaut.  Beyond his own career, Bochco helped shepherd along those of several other prominent writers, hiring David Milch on “Hill Street” and enlisting David E. Kelley — then a Boston lawyer — to work on “L.A. Law.”  When the Producers Guild of America honored Bochco with its David Susskind lifetime achievement award in 1999, his track record of quality programs was cited as “the standard all television producers strive for.”  For all of his success with police dramas and legal shows, Bochco produced a wide variety of series, from the animated satire “Capitol Critters” to “Public Morals,” an edgy comedy on which he collaborated with Jay Tarses that also ran into standards-and-practices problems.  Although major successes eluded him in his later years, Bochco remained active and in demand, taking over as showrunner of “Commander in Chief” — an ABC drama that featured Geena Davis as the first female U.S. president — and co-creating “Over There,” an FX series that focused on soldiers in Iraq and their families back home. The latter, introduced while the war was ongoing in 2005, engendered controversy because of the timing and subject matter.  Bochco also produced the legal drama “Raising the Bar” for TNT that ran two seasons in 2008 and 2009.  The producer also tried his hand at novels, writing “Death by Hollywood,” a darkly comic satire with a struggling screenwriter as its protagonist. His struggle with leukemia prompted him to write his autobiography, “Truth is a Total Defense: My Fifty Years in Television,” which he self-published in 2016.  Bochco was loyal to his friends — certain actors appeared in his shows time and again — but could also nurse a grudge. He also became disenchanted with what he saw as creative interference from the networks, hewing more toward cable.  Bochco’s association with the business extended to his family. His second wife, Barbara Bosson, co-starred in “Hill Street Blues,” and his sister, Joanna Frank, had a recurring role on “L.A. Law” as the wife of firm partner Douglas Brackman, played by her real-life husband (and thus Bochco’s brother-in-law), Alan Rachins. The producer later married Dayna Kalins, a TV executive. His son, Jesse, became a prominent director, working on many of his father’s shows.  Bochco was thrice married, the first time to Gabrielle Levin, the second to Bosson.  He is survived by his third wife Dayna Kalins, whom he married in 2000, as well children Melissa Bochco, Jesse Bochco and Sean Flanagan, and two grandchildren.",0
"It’s no secret that Kanye West is causing a swarm of media speculation about his strange behavior. From calling slavery “a choice” to openly supporting President Trump, West has sparked just as much outrage as there is intrigue surrounding his celebrity. Basically, it’s been two weeks of wild behavior and lots of questions. And now there’s even more of that to contemplate. So, what’s happened now? Well, Kanye West got rid of his phone, so he’s not answering anyone’s text messages.  The news of West’s phone abandonment comes from West himself via is Twitter account. West took to the social media platform to explain his lack of communication to friends, family, and business associates:  For anyone who’s tried to text or call me in the past 2 weeks I got rid of that phone so I could focus on these albums  West is currently in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, trying to focus all his energy on his upcoming album. So, basically, he has ditched mobile communication in favor of cultivating his inherent talent and musical genius. Can’t blame him for drowning out the noise to focus on the music. He’s clearly committed to his craft.  Here’s a look at what West tweeted about getting rid of his cell phone:  West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, reportedly joined the 40-year-old rapper in Wyoming in early May 2018. At the time, a source close to the family told People that Kardashian was content to join him as he worked:  Kim happily joined Kanye in Jackson Hole. She wants to be supportive so he can finish his album. The album has caused Kanye a lot of stress. He is a perfectionist and wants the music to be amazing.  West’s dedication to his music is truly admirable and it’s great that Kardashian is there to support him in this effort. A lot of fantastic and interesting music is sure to come out of it.  In addition to supporting West’s creative pursuits, Kardashian is also reportedly worried about his health, especially in light of his recent erratic and scandalous behavior. According to People’s source, Kardashian headed out to Wyoming to make sure he’s in a good place:  Kim is absolutely concerned about Kanye. She likes being in Jackson Hole so she can keep an eye on his health. She wants to make sure he eats and sleeps enough. She doesn’t want him to push himself beyond his limits. She wants a healthy Kanye.  How sweet and supportive of her! It’s so obvious how much West and Kardashian love and value each other. You have to give them credit for always having each other’s backs, even in light health issues and media scandals.  Hopefully, none of that will overshadow West's music. On Tuesday, May 15, West previewed some of his new music on Twitter. The rapper posted a video of himself sitting at a keyboard while a beat plays in the background. Here’s a look at what West is working on:  In the video, you can also see what seem to be sample tracklists on whiteboards above his head and to his right. These tracklists look to be part of multiple projects that he’s working on at the moment. Among the tracks listed are “Extacy”, “Wouldn’t Leave”, “Reborn”, and “4th Dimension.”  So, it’s pretty clear that West is hard at work and making all that studio magic happen. Dedicated fans of the rapper are waiting anxiously to see what types of tracks he’s going to drop. If the preview on Twitter is a hint of what’s to come, then his fans are definitely going to be happy!",1
"IT certainly says a lot about Meghan Markle’s confidence that she’s allowed her fiancé Prince Harry to invite ex-girlfriends to his wedding.  We previously told how Cressida Bonas, who dated the young royal for two years between 2012 and 2014, had got the call-up.  AP:Associated Press 10 Meghan may have won Prince Harry's heart, but who else came close?  However, this week it has been reported that Zimbabwean beauty Chelsy Davy, who had an on-off six-year relationship with the prince, has been snubbed from the wedding reception.  So, which of his other glamorous exes have made the cut – and who is Not Formally Invited?  Ellie Goulding - INVITED  Getty Images - Getty 10 Ellie Goulding was spotted canoodling with Harry at the Audi Polo Challenge in May 2016  Prince Harry is believed to have dated the 31-year-old singer after the pair were spotted canoodling at the Audi Polo Challenge in May 2016.  The couple, who have been pals since meeting at Prince William’s wedding in 2011, are said to have exchanged some flirty text messages.  At the time, a source close to Harry’s circle told The Sun: “He has told friends how much he likes Ellie and she is clearly taken by him.”  In March we revealed that Ellie has been invited to the nuptials on May 19 - seven years after she sang at the wedding reception of Harry’s brother William in Buckingham Palace.  Camilla Thurlow - NFI  Getty - Contributor 10 Love Island star Camilla is rumoured to have snogged Harry - but is now dating reality show co-star Jamie Jewitt  The Love Island star, 27, is rumoured to have dated Harry following his split from Cressida Bonas in 2014, having been spotted snogging him in Tonteria nightclub in Chelsea.  She managed to stay pretty tight-lipped about it on the reality show last year, claiming ""a lady never tells"" when quizzed during a game of Truth or Dare.  Like Meghan, Camilla is an eager charity worker, having worked for the Halo Trust - the mine-clearance charity whose work was promoted by Princess Diana - and has described the actress as ""amazing and beautiful"".  We can imagine the two women being bezzie mates - but sadly, as far as we know, Camilla isn't on the guestlist.    Caroline Flack - NFI  Rex Features 10 Caroline is now engaged - but was previously linked to Harry  Caroline's been busy in her own love life of late, getting engaged to Apprentice star Andrew Brady after just three months of dating.  The 38-year-old dated Prince Harry in 2009, while she was a host on Gladiators.  Speaking about her brief romance with the prince, Caroline said: ""‘Once the story got out, that was it. We had to stop seeing each other.  ""I was no longer Caroline Flack, TV presenter, I was Caroline Flack, Prince Harry’s bit of rough.""  With Love Island returning to our screens in the coming months, we imagine Caroline might be ""too busy"" even if she did land an invite...  Chelsy Davy - NFI  Rex Features 10 Chelsy was Prince Harry's first love, after meeting through mutual pals in 2004  Chelsy, 32, returned to Africa to study while Harry focused on his army career and Royal duties.  Chelsy was Prince Harry's first love, after meeting through mutual pals in 2004She returned to the UK to take up a top job at a law firm and was seen accompanying Harry to a number of high-brow events, including his brother's wedding to Kate Middleton.  Getty - Contributor 10 Chelsy is said to be 'a little hurt' to be missed off the reception guest list  Though that year brought an end to their romance, yet party animal Chelsy and Harry remain good friends.  If reports are to be believed, she hasn't been asked to Harry's evening do at Frogmore House, and is ""surprised"", ""shocked"" and ""a little hurt"".  Cressida Bonas - INVITED  Getty - Contributor 10 Cressida and Harry tried to keep their relationship relatively private  Model and actress Cressida, 28, was introduced to Harry by his cousin Princess Eugenie.  The pair shared a lust for life but still managed to keep their relationship relatively private, apart from moments when they were snapped off holidaying or partying at Glasto.  She allegedly called off their romance due to struggling with life in the spotlight while engagement rumours swirled, but the pair have remained on good terms.  Eugenie is also still pals with Cressy, and has invited her to her autumn wedding.  We can't imagine she'll recycle her frock from Harry's big day...  She is now dating chartered surveyor Harry Wentworth-Stanley, and posted a loved-up snap on Instagram on his 29th birthday, describing him as ""my love"". Could wedding bells be on the cards for her, too?  Splash News 10 Cressida has apparently been invited to the wedding  Florence Brudenell-Bruce - NFI  Getty - Contributor 10 Lingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce was spotted on Harry’s arm in 2011  Lingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce, 32, was spotted on Harry’s arm in 2011, shortly after his split from Chelsy Davy.  She went on to marry multi-millionaire Henry St George in a romantic ceremony in the south of France, though her and the prince remain pals.  So, has she been invited? Well, she currently lives in the Bahamas and has a three-year-old to look after, so we'd say it's pretty unlikely she'll be there on the big day.    Mollie King - NFI  Getty Images - Getty 10 Mollie caught Harry's eye in 2012 and the pair enjoyed a string of dates  The Saturdays singer caught Harry's eye in 2012 and the pair enjoyed a string of dates.  When quizzed about the romance, Mollie said: ""Yes, I have met Harry, and we did go out for a drink.""  Around the same time she publicly outed them, Harry reportedly called things off and Mollie went on to date supermodel David Gandy.  As far as we know, the Strictly Come Dancing semi-finalist hasn't been asked to sing (or dance) on the big day...

"It seems Julia Roberts and Danny Moder may be headed for divorce. When the actress took the part of a worker at a secret government facility on Homecoming, an upcoming political thriller on Amazon, she knew just who she wanted as her co-star: her old pal Dermot Mulroney.  She lobbied for him to join the show, and on March 8, it was officially announced that Dermot, 54 — who starred with Julia in My Best Friend's Wedding and August: Osage County — would play her character's boyfriend.  Julia and Dermot. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  She was thrilled. Her husband? Furious. ""Julia's reunion with Dermot hasn't gone down well with Danny,"" an insider tells Life & Style. ""Even though Julia's reminded him that Dermot is happily married with children, Danny's jealous.""  It's just one of many issues causing problems in Julia and Danny's marriage. The cameraman and cinematographer ""is at the end of his rope,"" the insider tells Life & Style. ""Julia and Danny are constantly quarreling. Their 15-year marriage is on the rocks, and they could even split.""  Julia and Danny have been drifting apart for years. ""Her controlling ways, their different approaches to parenting, and his desire to have his own career, and be the man of the house have all contributed to arguments,"" says the insider. But recently, things have gotten worse. ""They have been living separate lives,"" the insider notes  Julia, Danny, and their three kids in August 2015. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Instead of focusing on repairing his marriage to Julia, 50, Danny, 49, ""has been devoting his time to the kids [twins Hazel and Finn, 13, and son Henry, 10], friends, and jobs away from his wife."" When he's home, the insider says, he often stays across the street from their beachfront compound, in a house they bought in 2016 that was originally meant for guests or nannies. The rift is only continuing to grow. ""Julia is a super-protective parent, which has caused friction with Danny, who believes in being more relaxed,"" explains the insider.  But when it comes to other men, he's anything but. When Julia called hunky survivalist Bear Grylls ""a man's man"" after they completed a charity trek across Africa together in 2017, ""that really got under Danny’s skin,"" says the insider. Danny was also seething after his wife turned into what he called a fawning ""sports groupie,"" the insider says, when they spent time with British and Spanish soccer stars at meet-and-greets in 2016 and 2017.  Danny's insecurity extends to his career, too: He hates being seen as Mr. Julia Roberts. ""For a long time, Danny viewed Julia's success as his own failure. It triggered a fear that he was not good enough, and the fact that Julia controls everything at home made it worse,"" explains the insider. ""Feeling insecure and competitive with your partner is no way to live.""  Though they love each other, friends fear they can't go on like this much longer. ""Julia and Danny's marriage is hanging by a thread,"" says the insider. ""Unless they can come to terms with their issues, they're headed for divorce.""

"After years of rapping about food (most famously, demanding ""hurry up with my damn croissant"" on Yeezus' ""I Am a God""), Kanye West may soon be selling it. The music artist and designer has been quietly looking to expand his portfolio into food service, according to a new report that says West has been eying storefronts for a restaurant in his wife Kim Kardashian's native neighborhood, Calabasas.  “Kanye’s shopping for the ideal premises to create a flagship restaurant in Calabasas,” a source told Radar . While the menu seemingly will not offer patrons the chance to demand their own croissants, it will be more ""comfort food-oriented."" “He has this vision of creating high-end comfort food just like his mom used to make,"" the source added, ""but with a price tag that’s as eye-watering as it is mouth-watering, of course.” Of course.  West could always pad the menu with recipes from his wife, as she's shared her love of cooking on social media, showing off her own fried chicken, cornbread, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, and collard greens as part of her #SoulFoodSundays. While Kardashian received some backlash after first sharing photos from her meal back in July of 2016, she later posted testimonials from people she's cooked for like Kevin Hart, who told her ""You did that!,"" and actor and TV host Terrence J, who said, ""You made me a believer."" “You guys don’t understand, I’ve been making this food since high school, so when I started this post all of my high school friends were DM’ing me saying, ‘Blast from the past!,'” Kardashian explained earlier this year.  Whatever does end up on the menu, it would be shocking if it didn't include ice cream , which is one of the few things guaranteed to make West smile. Another thing that would likely delight West is being able to design custom uniforms for his restaurant staff.  While the idea of a Kardashian-approved restaurant in Calabasas seems too impossible to fail, West would be taking a risk in venturing into the food and service industry. Few celebrities have actually thrived in that space, as just today brought the closure of Jessica Biel's West Hollywood restaurant Au Fudge. Then again, he's managed to crossover into fashion on his own terms and breaking into the food industry may be no different — so long as he can sell comfort food like Yeezys.",1
"The eight-hour diet is the latest health craze to hit Hollywood and fitness gurus are raving about its benefits.  The programme is based on only eating within a window of eight hours per day, and fasting for the other 16 to kick the body into fat burning mode.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of the diet, eating breakfast at 10am and having their last meal of the day before 6pm.  Australian nutritionist, Lee Holmes, spoke to FEMAIL about the benefits of the eight-hour diet and discusses whether or not it really works.  Advertisement  ""The idea of intermittent fasting may seem foreign, impossible and even scary to some but, I've got a secret for you! It's something you do every. Single. Day,"" Lee said.  Over the past few months, fitness gurus and nutrition professionals have been raving about the benefits of the eight hour diet. Photo / Getty Images  ""As soon as you drift off to sleep at night until the moment you open your eyes in the morning, you've been doing intermittent fasting. They don't call it break-fast for nothing because essentially you're breaking the fast when you eat your first meal in the morning.""  Lee said the easiest way to begin fasting is to increase the time after your last meal in the evening and your breakfast in the morning.  ""By practicing fasting, you allow your body and gut time to digest, rest and heal. Fasting lightens the load on the gut, allowing it to work at its optimum. It also improves the cleansing process,"" Lee said.  ""New research is beginning to demonstrate that intermittent fasting can increase the speed of cell recycling and regeneration, which reduces inflammation in the body. This means we can get sick less, experience less pain and become less susceptible to diseases.""  Fasting can also help kick-start weight loss and repair the body, while reducing blood pressure and increasing energy.  ""But don't be fooled! Just because you're fasting, it doesn't mean you'll go hungry! If you eat satiating, delicious whole foods, you won't be hungry throughout the day - think good fats and protein sources instead of low-calorie junk food,"" Lee said.  Acknowledging that the diet may not be for everyone, as it can be tough to stick too, she also added that those who have suffered from an eating disorder in the past should not try it.",0
"In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making.  From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna.  To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events.  Kanye West Dates Amber Rose  In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance.  Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West  In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.”  Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged  Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring.  Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian  Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!).  Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose  As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.”  Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian  In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary.  North West Is Born  Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song “Only One” for his little girl. Click here to see the most adorable pics of Nori.  🙏 A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jan 4, 2014 at 6:20pm PST  Blac Chyna Befriends Kim Kardashian  Chyna started making regular appearances in Kardashian’s Instagram photos in early 2014. As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side.  Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian  After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014.  Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar  Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.”  Blac Chyna and Tyga Split  In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” an insider told Us Weekly at the time. “They also have a lot of friends in common — Tyga is Kanye [West’s] boy and Blac Chyna got close to [his wife] Kim [Kardashian] — so they don’t want to make it weird.”  Amber Rose Splits From Wiz Khalifa  Despite previously saying she wanted to be with Khalifa “for the rest of my life,” Rose filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after they tied the knot. “I never knew what a true heartache felt like until now,” Rose tweeted several weeks later.  Tyga Starts Dating Kylie Jenner  In the fall of 2014, Tyga and the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan sparked a series of dating rumors after they were seen hanging out together regularly. In August 2014, Tyga hosted Kylie Jenner’s 17th birthday party, and they continued to be spotted out together as the months went on. However, due to Jenner’s underage status, the couple never publicly acknowledged their romance.  Amber Rose Slams Kylie Jenner and Tyga  Fresh off her split from Khalifa, Rose befriended Chyna, who was now estranged from Kim after the Tyga/Kylie dating rumors. In February 2015, Rose appeared on The Breakfast Club radio show, where she gave her unfiltered thoughts on Jenner’s relationship with Tyga. “She’s a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o’clock and relax,” Rose said of Jenner. “That’s ridiculous. [Tyga] should be ashamed of himself. For sure. He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17.”  Khloé Kardashian Sparks Twitter Feud With Amber Rose  Not willing to let her little sister get thrown under the bus, Khloé Kardashian weighed in on the feud on Twitter. “’I was a stripper since I was 15 years old,’ Amber Rose told Foxx. Please don’t worry about my sister who has a career & her s–t together at ONLY 17 people who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones,” Khloé tweeted, making note of Rose’s past as a stripper. “Please stop talking about us in interviews mama. None of us talk about you.” Her comments prompted an intense back-and-forth between the two.  Kanye West Gets Involved in Twitter Feud  Rose responded to Khloé’s tweets with a series of West-inspired memes. One read, “When ur sister in law calls out ur ex for being a stripper but ur wife has a sex tape,” referencing Kim’s sex tape with singer Ray J. West shot back a few days later, making his own appearance on The Breakfast Club. “She’s just soakin’ in the moment. If Kim had dated me when I first wanted to be with her, there wouldn’t be an Amber Rose,” West said of his ex. “It’s very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that’s with Amber Rose. … I had to take 30 showers before I got with Kim.”  💋 A post shared by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Apr 21, 2015 at 4:34pm PDT  Blac Chyna Mocks Kylie Jenner Online  As Jenner’s romance with Tyga continued, his ex posted several telling photos via Instagram in April 2015, making light of the new relationship. While the #KylieJennerChallege started trending, Chyna shared a photo of herself wearing giant fake lips. Then she posted screengrabs, which she alleged were from Tyga. One such text read: “I want to be with u.”  Kylie Jenner Goes Public With Tyga on 18th Birthday  In August 2015, Jenner finally turned 18 and, now legal, went public with Tyga. The social media starlet had a blowout birthday bash, and her new official beau gifted her with two cars, including a $260,000 Ferrari.  Tyga Feuds With Blac Chyna Over Kylie Jenner’s Ferrari  The pricey purchase sparked a fresh feud between Tyga, Chyna and Rose. TMZ reported that Tyga had leased the swanky gift, which Tyga claimed was a lie. “When the hating don’t work they start telling lies. #WhereYoFerarriTho?” he captioned an Instagram selfie. Naturally, Rose chimed in, defending her friend with a photo of her own pink Ferrari. “She don’t need a Ferrari she can Drive mine,” she captioned the shot.  Kylie Jenner and Tyga Split, Get Back Together  On Tyga’s 26th birthday in November 2015, the couple split and Jenner deleted almost all mentions of her flame from her Instagram account. But days later they made up, and Jenner described the rekindling romance as “Chaos” in a new post.  #nofilter A post shared by Annalu (@annalucardosod) on Dec 11, 2015 at 3:39pm PST  Tyga Has a Fling With a Brazilian Model  Us exclusively broke the story in January 2016 that Tyga had been cheating on Jenner with Brazilian model Annalu Cardoso for months. The pair started texting in late 2014 and had “hooked up a couple of times,” an insider told Us. Around the same time, 14-year-old model Molly O’Malia also accused the “Stimulated” rapper of sending her “uncomfortable” messages.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BA9v0LFxvip/  Blac Chyna Posts Photo With Rob Kardashian  Rumors abounded on January 25, 2016, when Chyna posted a black-and-white Instagram of herself in the loving embrace of Rob Kardashian with the caption “The beginning.”  Khloé Kardashian Seemingly Reacts to Rob’s News  Shortly after the photo was posted, Khloé tweeted a telling quote from The Godfather: “You can do anything. But never go against the family.” After followers noted her quote was likely about Rob and Chyna, the reality star replied, “You guys do know I have about 100 family members correct? I was referring to a family member who just bailed out of doing my talk show today. But hey, maybe my quote can go towards a few people today.”  Rob Kardashian Confirms the Relationship  A day after Chyna’s Instagram post, Rob reposted a meme of his new love holding a car seat. “Blac Chyna probably out shopping rite now as she plan to give birth to the only next generation of the Kardashian Name! #BabyKardashian.” He captioned the meme with the clover emoji, which became a secret symbol between the pair. Twitter users pointed out that Rob’s birthday is on March 17, a.k.a. St. Patrick’s Day.  “The family is in a bind trying to be supportive of Rob’s life while being sensitive of Kylie’s relationship with Tyga,” a source explained to Us at the start of the romance.  Kanye West Goes Off on Wiz Khalifa on Twitter  The same week — but on an unrelated note — West took aim at former pal Khalifa and ex Rose in a headline-making Twitter rant. It started when Khalifa dissed the title of West’s upcoming album, Waves. “Please don’t take the wave,” he tweeted. “Max B is the wavy one. He created the wave. There is no wave without him.”  He then went on to write, “Hit this kk and become yourself.” Misunderstanding Khalifa’s reference to Khalifa Kush weed, West then started ranting against the rapper on Twitter. “Like, oh that’s Ye and I can put his wife’s initials on my twitter @WizKhalifa,” West wrote. “You have distracted from my creative process. I went to look at your twitter and you were wearing cool pants.”  As the tweets raged on, West slammed his ex Rose, writing, “4th you let a stripper trap you. 5th I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years.”  Amber Rose Weighs In on Kanye/Wiz Twitter Beef  Not willing to let her ex’s insults slide, Rose responded with the tweet, “Awww @kanyewest are u mad I’m not around to play in ur a–hole anymore? #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch.” West later deleted his tweets, apologizing for the misunderstanding about Kim’s initials, to which Rose replied, “Lol @kanyewest Now u wanna delete ur tweets cuz Muva has arrived? #TwitterFingers #UrGettingBodiedByAStripperN—a.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"0  NBC has ordered a trio of additional episodes for the new drama series Manifest, but this is not a case of playing it safe. Traditionally when a network series debuts during the fall season, it does so with 13 episodes in the can. Then, depending on how the show does ratings-wise, a network might order nine additional episodes (called a “back nine”) to consist of a full season’s worth of episodes—22 in total. With Manifest, however, NBC is taking a page out of cable’s book by allowing the drama series to conclude its first season with just 16 episodes, rather than have to draw the story out to 22.  The show revolves around the passengers of a flight that experienced turbulence on its way back to New York City, during which the power in the plane went out. The plane recovered quickly, but when it landed in New York City the flight’s passengers and crew were shocked to discover they’ve all been missing and presumed dead for more than five years. Each week’s episode features a procedural element as the passengers returned to lives that had moved on without them, as well as an ongoing mythology hook regarding what exactly happened to the plane.  This order of three additional episodes is good news both for the writers of Manifest and fans of the show. Back when Damon Lindelof was making LOST, he and co-showrunner Carlton Cuse famously lobbied ABC to let them set a finite endpoint for the series. A show that serialized could only go on for so long, and by Season 3 they were running out of the steam necessary to create 22 hours of content each year. ABC reluctantly acquiesced, and the subsequent seasons consisted of no more than 18 episodes each year. Now seasons of 13 episodes are the norm on cable networks, while broadcast networks continue to stick to the 22-episode seasons to fill out air time necessary for ads.  So yes, Manifest will at the very least conclude its first season, and a Season 2 pickup is probably likely if the ratings remain strong. The show airs on NBC Mondays at 10pm ET.",0
"Lily Collins was shocked when she was complimented for losing weight to play an anorexic woman in Netflix’s upcoming series To the Bone. During an interview with The Edit published on Thursday, June 29, the actress, who suffered an eating disorder herself in the past, said that people’s obsession with being thin is why the disease exists.  Celebrities’ Weight Loss and Transformations: Before and After Pictures  “I was leaving my apartment one day and someone I’ve known for a long time, my mom’s age, said to me, ‘Oh, wow, look at you!'” Collins told the site. “I tried to explain [I lost weight for a role] and she goes, ‘No! I want to know what you’re doing, you look great!’ I got into the car with my mom and said, ‘That is why the problem exists.’”  The role hit home for Collins, who previously revealed that she suffered an eating disorder.  “There’s a scene where I’m taking my clothes off to be weighed by Carrie Preston, my stepmom in the movie, who takes a photo on her phone and shows it to me. I didn’t think she’d actually take one but she did,” Collins recalled. “I saw myself in the photo and my heart dropped. So when my mom saw the film, she saw Lily’s reaction because she knows me the best.”  The scene caused her mom to breakdown.  “The first time she was a bit in shock,” Collins added of her mom’s reaction. “The second time I looked over at the end and she was sobbing; it really hit her hard.”  The Love, Rosie actress also told The Edit that she couldn’t book photoshoots in magazines because she was too skinny.  “I told my publicist that if I could snap my fingers and gain 10 pounds right that second, I would,” she concluded of the experience.  To the Bone hits Netflix on July 14.  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"It always hurts if an ex ends up with one of your friends, but it’s especially painful when everyone involved is famous! We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how Tom Cruise is feeling so betrayed by Jamie Foxx dating his ex-wife Katie Holmes, according to a source.  We’ve got a bro-code violation going on! Tom Cruise, 55, and Jamie Foxx, 49, were once pals, as the megastar recruited the actor to star with him in 2004’s action film Collateral. They remained friendly up until the Annie star began dating Katie Holmes, 38, just a year after she divorced Tom in 2012 in such a dramatic way. Four years later, Holmes and Foxx have finally taken their romance out into the open, but the Mission: Impossible star has aware that they were a couple for some time and isn’t thrilled that his friend would date his former wife.  HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Tom has known about Katie and Jamie’s secret relationship since the beginning and it has always bothered him that they were hooking up. While Katie and Jamie did their best to keep things a secret from the world, Tom is too well-connected and found out about them shortly after their romance began,” a source close to Tom tellsEXCLUSIVELY. See pics of Tom and Katie’s marriage in photos, here  “Tom is shocked and upset that Katie is dating a costar he once considered a close friend. He feels betrayed by both of them,” our insider adds. Katie broke away from Tom and the Church of Scientology in such a public way, serving him with divorce papers in June of 2012 when he was away on location in Iceland filming a movie. While she and daughter Suri, now 11, remained holed up in New York for months, Katie started going to more social events in 2013, and it was in August of that year that she met Jamie at a Hamptons gala.  The two were rumored to be secretly dating on the down-low for four years now , apparently out of respect for Tom by not making their relationship public and going to great lengths to never be photographed together. But now that over five years have passed since she filed for divorce, the couple apparently were less careful about keeping the romance out of the public eye. They were spotted over Labor Day weekend holding hands together while walking down the beach in Malibu and didn’t appear to care that the paparazzi captured the PDA.  HollywoodLifers, do you think now that they’re out in the open as a couple, Katie and Jamie will start attending events together?",1
"As far as spectator fashion goes, few tennis fans can compete with Kate Middleton. The Duchess of Cambridge is a regular at Wimbledon and always picks the perfect summer dress to stand out in the crowd. This year, Pippa Middleton appeared to get in on the action, attending the tournament in several looks that seemed to take cues from her sister, particularly the pale blue Tephi dress she wore today.  Like her sister, Pippa has a clear preference for pastels—see the blush pink crochet piece from last week and the light blue frock from this morning. Kate also gravitates toward solid colors and off-the-shoulder silhouettes; Pippa’s take on the look featured asymmetric draping at the neck, which lent a playful detail. Where Kate has made straw wedges a staple in her summer wardrobe, Pippa went a different route with practical wood-soled sling-backs with a block heel.

For information on the murder of Diana Miller, see Murder of Diana Miller  On 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales died as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma road tunnel in Paris, France. Her companion, Dodi Fayed, and the driver of the Mercedes S280, Henri Paul, were pronounced dead at the scene. A fourth passenger in the car, bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, was seriously injured but survived.  Although the media blamed the behaviour of the paparazzi who followed the car, a French judicial investigation in 1999 found that the crash was caused by Henri Paul, who lost control of the Mercedes at high speed while he was intoxicated and under the effects of prescription drugs. Paul was the deputy head of security at the Hôtel Ritz at the time of the crash and had goaded the paparazzi waiting outside the hotel earlier.[1] His inebriation may have been made worse by anti-depressants and traces of an anti-psychotic in his body.[2][3] The investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.[4] After hearing evidence at the British inquest in 2008, a jury returned to a verdict of ""unlawful killing"" by Paul and the paparazzi pursuing the car.[5]  Diana's death caused a substantial outpouring of worldwide grief, including numerous floral tributes and her funeral was watched by an estimated 2 billion people. The Royal Family were criticised in the press for their reaction to Diana's death.  Circumstances [ edit ]  Events preceding the crash [ edit ]  A car similar to that involved in the accident.  On Saturday, 30 August 1997, Diana left Sardinia on a private jet and arrived in Paris with Dodi Fayed, the son of Mohamed Al-Fayed.[6] They had stopped there en route to London, having spent the preceding nine days together on board Mohamed Al-Fayed's yacht Jonikal on the French and Italian Riviera. They had intended to stay there for the night. Mohamed Al-Fayed was and is the owner of the Hôtel Ritz Paris. He also owned an apartment in Rue Arsène Houssaye, a short distance from the hotel, just off the Avenue des Champs Elysées.  Henri Paul, the deputy head of security at the Ritz Hotel, had been instructed to drive the hired black 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 in order to elude the paparazzi;[9] a decoy vehicle left the Ritz first from the main entrance on Place Vendôme, attracting a throng of photographers. Diana and Fayed then departed from the hotel's rear entrance,[10] Rue Cambon at around 00:20 on 31 August CEST (22:20 on 30 August UTC), heading for the apartment in Rue Arsène Houssaye. They did this to avoid the nearly 30 photographers waiting in the front of the hotel.[10] They were the rear passengers; Trevor Rees-Jones, a member of the Fayed family's personal protection team, was in the (right) front passenger seat. It was believed that Diana and Dodi were not wearing seat belts.[12] After leaving the Rue Cambon and crossing the Place de la Concorde, they drove along Cours la Reine and Cours Albert 1er – the embankment road along the right bank of the River Seine – into the Place de l'Alma underpass.[13]  The crash [ edit ]  At 12:23 a.m., Paul lost control of the vehicle at the entrance to the Pont de l'Alma tunnel. The car struck the righthand wall and then swerved to the left of the two-lane carriageway before it collided head-on with the 13th pillar that supported the roof.[14] The car was travelling at an estimated speed of 105 km/h (65 mph).[15] It then spun and hit the stone wall of the tunnel backwards, finally coming to a stop. The impact caused substantial damage, particularly to the front half of the vehicle, as there was no guard rail between the pillars to prevent this. Witnesses arriving shortly after the accident reported smoke.[17] Witnesses also reported that photographers on motorcycles ""swarmed the Mercedes sedan before it entered the tunnel.""[12]  The aftermath [ edit ]  The entrance to the Pont de l'Alma Tunnel, the site where Diana was fatally injured  As the victims lay in the wrecked car, the photographers, who had been driving slower and were accordingly some distance behind the Mercedes, reached the scene. The photographers were on motorcycles.[10] Some rushed to help, tried to open the doors and help the victims, while some of them took pictures. Airbags were deployed.[19] Police arrived on scene around 10 minutes after the crash at 00:30 and an ambulance was on site five minutes after the police, according to witnesses.[19] France Info radio reported that one photographer was beaten by witnesses who were horrified by the scene.[12] Five of the photographers were taken into custody.[17] Later, two others were detained and around 20 rolls of film were taken from the photographers.[12] Police also impounded their vehicles.[12] Firemen also arrived to help remove the victims.[20]  Still conscious, Rees-Jones had suffered multiple serious facial injuries and a head contusion.[21] The front occupants' airbags had functioned normally.[22] The occupants were not wearing seat belts.[a] Diana, who had been sitting in the right rear passenger seat, was still conscious. Critically injured, Diana was reported to murmur repeatedly, ""Oh my God,"" and after the photographers and other helpers were pushed away by police, ""Leave me alone.""[23] In June 2007 the Channel 4 documentary Diana: The Witnesses in the Tunnel claimed that the first person to touch Diana was Dr. Maillez,[24] who chanced upon the scene. He reported that Diana had no visible injuries but was in shock. Diana was removed from the car at 1:00 am. She then went into cardiac arrest and following external cardiopulmonary resuscitation, her heart started beating again.[26] She was moved to the SAMU ambulance at 1:18 am, left the scene at 1:41 am and arrived at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital at 2:06 am.[27]  Fayed had been sitting in the left rear passenger seat and was shortly afterwards pronounced dead.[28] Paul was declared dead on removal from the wreckage. Both were taken to the Institut Médico-Légal (IML), the Paris mortuary, not to a hospital. Paul was later found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.175 grams per 100 mL of blood - about 3.5 times the legal limit in France.[21]  Despite attempts to save her, Diana's internal injuries were too extensive: her heart had been displaced to the right side of the chest, which tore the pulmonary vein and the pericardium. Despite lengthy resuscitation attempts, including internal cardiac massage, she died at 4:00 a.m.[31] Anesthesiologist Bruno Riou announced her death at 6 am at a news conference held at the hospital.[17][32]  Later that morning, Jean-Pierre Chevènement (French Minister of the Interior) visited the hospital with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.[33] At around 5:00 pm, Diana's former husband, Charles, Prince of Wales, and her two older sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, arrived in Paris. The group visited the hospital along with French President Jacques Chirac and thanked the doctors for trying to save her life.[35] Prince Charles accompanied Diana's body home on Sunday.[36] Her body was taken to the Hammersmith and Fulham mortuary in London for its autopsy later that day.[37]  Initial media reports stated Diana's car had collided with the pillar at 190 km/h (120 mph), and that the speedometer's needle had jammed at that position.[21] It was later announced the car's speed on collision was about 95–110 km/h (60–70 mph). The car was certainly travelling much faster than the speed limit of 50 km/h (31 mph). In 1999, a French investigation concluded the Mercedes had come into contact with another vehicle (a white Fiat Uno) in the tunnel.[38] The driver of that vehicle has never been conclusively traced, although many believe the driver of the Fiat was Le Van Thanh but the specific vehicle has not been identified.[39] [38]  It was remarked by Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, that if the accident had been caused in part by being hounded by paparazzi, that it would be ""doubly tragic.""[10] Diana's brother also blamed tabloid media for her death.[40] An 18-month French judicial investigation concluded in 1999 that the crash was caused by Paul, who lost control at high speed while intoxicated.[41]  Mourning [ edit ]  Members of the public were invited to sign a book of condolence at St. James Palace.[42] All 11,000 light bulbs at Harrods were turned off and not switched on again until after the funeral.[42] Throughout the night, members of the Women's Royal Voluntary Service and the Salvation Army provided support for people queuing along the Mall.[43] More than one million bouquets were left at her London home, Kensington Palace,[44] while at her family's estate of Althorp the public was asked to stop bringing flowers as the volume of people and flowers in the surrounding roads was said to be causing a threat to public safety.[45]  By 10 September, the pile of flowers outside Kensington Gardens was 5 feet (1.5 m) deep in places and the bottom layer had started to compost.[46] The people were quiet, queuing patiently to sign the book and leave their gifts. There were a few minor incidents. Fabio Piras, a Sardinian tourist, was given a one-week prison sentence on 10 September for having taken a teddy bear from the pile. When the sentence was later reduced to a £100 fine, Piras was punched in the face by a member of the public when he left the court.[47] The next day two Slovakian tourists, Maria Rigolova, a 54-year-old secondary school teacher and Agnese Sihelksa, a 50-year-old communications technician, were each given a 28-day prison sentence for having taken 11 teddy bears and a number of flowers from the pile outside the palace.[48] This was reduced to a fine of £200 each.[49]  Funeral [ edit ]  Early on, it was uncertain if it would be a state funeral since Diana had lost her royal status because of her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.[50]  Diana's death was met with extraordinary public expressions of grief, and her funeral at Westminster Abbey on 6 September drew an estimated 3 million mourners and onlookers in London,[51][52] and worldwide television coverage watched by 2.5 billion people.[53] It was aired to 200 countries in 44 languages.[54] Outside the Abbey and in Hyde Park crowds watched and listened to proceedings on large outdoor screens and speakers as guests filed in, including representatives of the many charities of which Diana was patron. Attendants included US First Lady Hillary Clinton, Bernadette Chirac, wife of the French President, Jacques Chirac and other celebrities, including Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and friends of Diana, George Michael and Elton John.[23][55] John performed a rewritten version of his song ""Candle in the Wind"" that was dedicated to her.[56] Protocol was disregarded when the guests applauded the speech by Diana's younger brother Earl Spencer, who strongly criticised the press and indirectly criticised the Royal Family for their treatment of her.[57] The funeral is estimated to have been watched by 31.5 million viewers in Britain. Precise calculation of the worldwide audience is not possible, but estimated at around 2.5 billion.[58]  After the end of the ceremony, the coffin was driven to Althorp in a Daimler hearse.[59] Mourners cast flowers at the funeral procession for almost the entire length of its journey and vehicles even stopped on the opposite carriageway of the M1 motorway as the cars passed.[60]  In a private ceremony, Diana was buried on an island in the middle of a lake called The Oval, which is part of the Pleasure Garden at Althorp.[61] In her coffin, she wore a black Catherine Walker dress and is clutching a rosary in her hands. The rosary had been a gift from Mother Teresa of Calcutta, a confidante of Diana, who had died the day before her funeral. A visitors' centre is open during summer months, with an exhibition about her and a walk around the lake. All profits are donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund.[62]  Reactions [ edit ]  Some criticised the reaction to Diana's death at the time as being ""hysterical"" and ""irrational"". As early as 1998 philosopher Anthony O'Hear identified the mourning as a defining point in the ""sentimentalisation of Britain"", a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred.[63] Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher responded to the reaction with ""The woman's dead. Shut up. Get over it"".[64] These criticisms were repeated on the 10th anniversary, when journalist Jonathan Freedland expressed the opinion that ""It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary ... we cringe to think about it."" In 2010, Theodore Dalrymple suggested ""sentimentality, both spontaneous and generated by the exaggerated attention of the media, that was necessary to turn the death of the princess into an event of such magnitude thus served a political purpose, one that was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself"".[65] Some cultural analysts disagreed. Sociologist Deborah Steinberg pointed out that many Britons associated Diana not with the Royal Family but with social change and a more liberal society: ""I don't think it was hysteria, the loss of a public figure can be a touchstone for other issues.""[66] Carol Wallace of People Magazine said that the fascination with Diana's death had to do with ""the fairy tale failing to end happily – twice, first when she got divorced and now that she died.""[67]  Royal family [ edit ]  The Queen expressed her dismay at Diana's death when she found out.[68] Prince Charles was the person who told their sons about their mother's death.[68] The princes were told of her death before dawn, as Prince Charles had to wake them up to share the tragic news.[69] The boys were close to their mother.[69] On Sunday morning after Diana's death, Queen Elizabeth, Princes Charles, William and Harry all wore black to church services at Balmoral Castle.[70] Prince Charles, William and Harry would be coming back to London on Friday, September 5.[71] The Queen, who returned to London from Balmoral, agreed to a television broadcast to the nation.[72]  The Royal Family was criticised for a rigid adherence to protocol, and their concern to care for Diana's grieving sons, was interpreted as a lack of compassion.[73] In particular, the refusal of Buckingham Palace to fly the Royal Standard at half-mast provoked angry headlines in newspapers.[73][74] ""Where is our Queen? Where is her Flag?"" asked The Sun.[72] The Palace's stance was one of royal protocol: no flag could fly over Buckingham Palace, as the Royal Standard is only flown when the Queen is in residence, and the Queen was then in Scotland. The Royal Standard never flies at half-mast as it is the Sovereign's flag and there is never an interregnum or vacancy in the monarchy, as the new monarch immediately succeeds his or her predecessor. Finally, as a compromise, the Union Flag was flown at half-mast as the Queen left for Westminster Abbey on the day of the funeral.[72] This set a precedent, and Buckingham Palace has subsequently flown the Union Flag when the Queen is not in residence.[75] A rift between Prince Charles and the Queen's private secretary Sir Robert Fellowes (Diana's brother-in-law) was reported in the media over what the nature of the Princess's funeral should be with Charles demanding a public funeral and Fellowes supporting the Queen's idea of a private one.[76] The Palace later issued a statement denying such rumours.[76]  Prince Harry said in 2017 that the death of his mother caused severe depression and grief.[77] Prince William was 15 and Harry was 12 when Diana died.[78]  Politicians' reactions [ edit ]  President Bill Clinton's remarks on Diana's death  British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said that he ""felt utterly devastated by the death of the Princess.""[50] President Bill Clinton said that he and his wife, Hillary Clinton were ""profoundly saddened"" when they found out about her death.[17] Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General said that her death ""has robbed the world of a consistent and committed voice for the improvement of the lives of suffering children worldwide.""[70] In Australia, the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, condemned the paparazzi for their overzealous coverage of Diana.[79] Russian President Boris Yeltsin praised Diana's charity work in a statement saying ""All know of Princess Diana's big contribution to charitable work, and not only in Great Britain"".[80][81] Among other politicians who sent messages of condolences were South African President Nelson Mandela, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[80]  Public reactions [ edit ]  In London, thousands of people carried bouquets and stood outside of Buckingham Palace after the news of her death.[70] People started bringing flowers within an hour after the news was shared.[68] The BBC flew its flags at half-mast.[70] Both radio and television aired the British national anthem, ""God Save the Queen,"" in response to Diana's death.[68]  People in the United States were shocked at her death.[82] In Paris, thousands of people visited the site of the crash and the hospital where Diana died.[83] People brought flowers and also attempted to visit the Hotel Ritz, as well.[83] In Bosnia, a land-mine survivor, Jasminko Bjelic, who had met Diana only three weeks earlier, said, ""She was our friend.""[70] Following her death many celebrities including actors and singers blamed the paparazzi and condemned their reckless behavior.[84][85]  During the four weeks following her funeral, the suicide rate in England and Wales rose by 17% and cases of deliberate self-harm by 44.3% compared with the average for that period in the four previous years. Researchers suggest that this was caused by the ""identification"" effect, as the greatest increase in suicides was by people most similar to Diana: women aged 25 to 44, whose suicide rate increased by over 45%.[86] Another research showed that 50% of Britons and 27% of Americans were deeply affected by her death as if someone they knew had died. It also concluded that in general women were more affected than men in both of the countries.[87] The same research showed that Diana's ""charitable endeavors"" and ""ability to identify with ordinary people"" were among the main factors that caused her to be admired and respected by the people.[87] In the weeks after her death counselling services reported an increase in the number of phone calls by the people who were seeking help due to grief or distress.[88]  The national grieving for Diana had economic effects. In the short term, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) estimated that retail sales dropped 1% that week. Traffic congestion in central London as crowds went to the palaces to pay homage likewise adversely affected productivity, and the CEBR estimated that would cost businesses £200 million, or a total loss of 0.1% of gross domestic product for the third quarter of 1997. However, in the long run the CEBR expected that to be offset by increased tourism and memorabilia sales.[89]  Memorials [ edit ]  Flame of Liberty, the unofficial Diana memorial in Paris, France The, the unofficial Diana memorial in Paris, France  In the years after her death, interest in the life of Diana has remained high. As a temporary memorial, the public co-opted the Flamme de la Liberté (Flame of Liberty), a monument near the Alma Tunnel related to the French donation of the Statue of Liberty to the United States. The messages of condolence have since been removed and its use as a Diana memorial has discontinued, though visitors still leave messages in her memory. A permanent memorial, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, was opened by the Queen in Hyde Park in London on 6 July 2004.[90]  Inquests [ edit ]  Under English law, an inquest is required in cases of sudden or unexplained death.[91][92] A French judicial investigation had already been carried out but the 6,000-page report was never published.[93] On 6 January 2004, six years after her death, an inquest into the deaths of Diana and Fayed opened in London held by Michael Burgess, the coroner of the Queen's household.[92] The coroner asked the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to make inquiries, in response to speculation that the deaths were not an accident.[92][94] The police investigation reported its findings in Operation Paget in December 2006.[95]  In January 2006, Lord Stevens explained in an interview on GMTV that the case is substantially more complex than once thought. The Sunday Times wrote on 29 January 2006 that agents of the British secret service were cross-examined because they were in Paris at the time of the crash. It was suggested in many journals that these agents might have exchanged the blood test of the driver with another blood sample (although no evidence for this has been forthcoming).[96][97]  The inquests into the deaths of Diana and Fayed opened on 8 January 2007, with Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss acting as Deputy Coroner of the Queen's Household for the Diana inquest and Assistant Deputy Coroner for Surrey in relation to the Fayed inquest. Butler-Sloss originally intended to sit without a jury;[98] this decision was later overturned by the High Court,[99] as well as the jurisdiction of the Coroner of the Queen's Household. On 24 April 2007, Butler-Sloss stepped down, saying she lacked the experience required to deal with an inquest with a jury.[100] The role of Coroner for the inquests was transferred to Lord Justice Scott Baker, who formally took up the role on 13 June as Coroner for Inner West London.[101]  On 27 July 2007, Baker, following representations for the lawyers of the interested parties, issued a list of issues likely to be raised at the inquest, many of which had been dealt with in great detail by Operation Paget:  Whether driver error on the part of Henri Paul caused or contributed to the cause of the collision Whether Henri Paul's ability to drive was impaired through drink or drugs Whether a Fiat Uno or any other vehicle caused or contributed to the collision Whether the actions of the Paparazzi caused or contributed to the cause of the collision Whether the road/tunnel layout and construction were inherently dangerous and, if so, whether this contributed to the collision Whether any bright/flashing lights contributed to or caused the collision and, if so, their source Whose decision it was that the Princess of Wales and Dodi Al Fayed should leave from the rear entrance to the Ritz and that Henri Paul should drive the vehicle Henri Paul's movements between 7 and 10 pm on 30 August 1997 The explanation for the money in Henri Paul's possession on 30 August 1997 and in his bank account Whether Andanson was in Paris on the night of the collision Whether Diana's life would have been saved if she had reached hospital sooner or if her medical treatment had been different Whether Diana was pregnant Whether Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were about to announce their engagement Whether and, if so in what circumstances, the Princess of Wales feared for her life The circumstances relating to the purchase of the ring The circumstances in which Diana's body was embalmed Whether the evidence of Tomlinson throws any light on the collision Whether the British or any other security services had any involvement in the collision Whether there was anything sinister about (i) the Cherruault burglary or (ii) the disturbance at the Big Pictures agency Whether correspondence belonging to the Princess of Wales (including some from Prince Philip) has disappeared, and if so the circumstances.[102]  The inquests officially began on 2 October 2007 with the swearing of a jury of six women and five men. Scott Baker delivered a lengthy opening statement giving general instructions to the jury and introducing the evidence.[103] The BBC reported that Mohamed Al-Fayed, having earlier reiterated his claim that his son and Diana were murdered by the Royal Family, immediately criticised the opening statement as biased.[104]  The inquest heard evidence from people connected with Diana and the events leading to her death, including Paul Burrell, Mohamed Al-Fayed, her stepmother, the survivor of the crash, and the former head of MI5.[105]  Scott Baker began his summing up to the jury on 31 March 2008.[106] He opened by telling the jury ""no-one except you and I and, I think, the gentleman in the public gallery with Diana and Fayed painted on his forehead sat through every word of evidence"" and concluded that there was ""not a shred of evidence"" that Diana's death had been ordered by the Duke of Edinburgh or organised by the security services.[107] Lord Justice Scott Baker concluded his summing up on Wednesday, 2 April 2008.[108] After summing up, the jury retired to consider five verdicts, namely unlawful killing by the negligence of either or both the following vehicles or Paul; accidental death or an open verdict.[106] The jury decided on 7 April 2008 that Diana had been unlawfully killed by the following vehicles.[109][110] Princes William and Harry released a statement in which they said that they ""agree with their verdicts and are both hugely grateful.""[111] Mohamed Al Fayed also said that he would accept the verdict and ""abandon his 10-year campaign to prove that Diana and Dodi were murdered in a conspiracy"".[112]  The cost of the inquiry exceeded £12.5 million, with the coroner's inquest at £4.5 million, and a further £8 million spent on the Metropolitan Police investigation. It lasted 6 months and heard 250 witnesses, with the cost heavily criticised in the media.[113]  Related lawsuits [ edit ]  Nine photographers who had been following Diana and Dodi in 1997, were charged with manslaughter in France.[114] France's ""highest court"" dropped the charges in 2002.[114]  Three photographers who took pictures of the aftermath of the crash on 31 August 1997 had their photographs confiscated and were tried for invasion of privacy for taking pictures through the open door of the crashed car.[114][115] The photographers, who were part of the ""paparazzi"" were acquitted in 2003.[114]  Conspiracy theories [ edit ]  Although the initial French investigation found that Diana had died as a result of an accident, several conspiracy theories have been raised.[116] Since February 1998, Fayed's father, Mohamed Al-Fayed (the owner of the Hôtel Ritz, where Paul worked, and thus potentially liable for wrongful death liability) has claimed that the crash was a result of a conspiracy,[117] and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of the Royal Family.[118] His claims were dismissed by a French judicial investigation[2] and by Operation Paget, a Metropolitan Police Service inquiry that concluded in 2006.[119] An inquest headed by Lord Justice Scott Baker into the deaths of Diana and Fayed began at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, on 2 October 2007, a continuation of the inquest that began in 2004.[100] On 7 April 2008, the jury concluded that Diana and Fayed were the victims of an ""unlawful killing"" by the ""grossly negligent"" chauffeur Paul and the drivers of the following vehicles.[120] Additional factors were ""the impairment of the judgment of the driver of the Mercedes through alcohol"" and ""the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt, the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else"".[109]  On 17 August 2013, Scotland Yard revealed that they were examining the credibility of information from a source that alleged that Diana was murdered by a member of the British military.[121][122]  In the media [ edit ]  After Dark television discussion - ""After Diana"" - broadcast on A specialtelevision discussion - ""After Diana"" - broadcast on Channel 4 on 13 September 1997  Actor George Clooney publicly lambasted several tabloids and paparazzi agencies following Diana's death. A few of the tabloids boycotted Clooney following the outburst, stating that he ""owed a fair portion of his celebrity"" to the tabloids and photo agencies in question.[123]  Diana was ranked third in the 2002 Great Britons poll sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the British public, after Sir Winston Churchill (1st) (a distant cousin), and Isambard Kingdom Brunel (2nd), just above Charles Darwin (4th), William Shakespeare (5th), and Isaac Newton (6th). That same year, another British poll named Diana's death as the most important event in the country's last 100 years.[124] Historian Nick Barrett criticised this outcome as being ""a pretty shocking result"".[125]  Later in 2004, US TV network CBS showed pictures of the crash scene in one of its programmes which were ""part of a 4,000-page French government report."" It showed an intact rear side and centre section of the Mercedes, including one of an unbloodied Diana with no outward injuries crouched on the rear floor with her back to the right passenger seat—the right rear door is fully open. The release of these pictures were poorly received in the UK, where it was felt that the privacy of Diana was being infringed.[126] Buckingham Palace, UK Prime Minister and Diana's brother condemned the action, while CBS defended its decision saying that the pictures ""are placed in journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given to Princess Diana just after the crash.""[127]  On 13 July 2006, Italian magazine Chi published photographs that showed Diana amid the wreckage of the car crash;[128] the photos were released despite an unofficial blackout on such photographs being published.[129][b] The editor of Chi defended his decision by saying he published the photographs simply because they had not been previously seen, and he felt the images were not disrespectful to the memory of Diana.[129]  The British newspaper The Daily Express has been criticised for continued and sustained coverage of Princess Diana following her death. A 2006 report in The Guardian showed that the newspaper had mentioned her in numerous recent news stories, with headlines including ""Perhaps Diana should have worn seatbelt"", ""Diana inquiry chief's laptop secrets stolen"", ""£250,000 a year bill to run Diana fountain"" and ""Diana seatbelt sabotage probe"".[130]  Internet coverage [ edit ]  Diana's death occurred at a time when Internet use in the developed world was booming, and several national newspapers and at least one British regional newspaper had already launched online news services. BBC News had set up online coverage of the general election earlier in 1997[131] and as a result of the widespread public and media attention that Diana's death resulted in, BBC News swiftly created a website featuring news coverage of Diana's death and the events that followed it. Diana's death helped BBC News officials realise how important online news services were becoming, and a full online news service was launched on 4 November that year, alongside the launch of the BBC's rolling news channel BBC News 24 on 9 November.[132]  See also [ edit ]  References [ edit ]  Notes [ edit ]  ^ Although there are conflicting reports (such as BBC and CNN ), the investigation Operation Paget report notes ""Operation Paget's view is that none of the seat belts were being worn at the time of the impact, including that of Trevor Rees-Jones.""

"Luann de Lesseps has plead not guilty to her arrest charges on Christmas Eve, PEOPLE confirms.  The Real Housewives of New York star entered her not guilty plea days before New Year’s. De Lesseps, 52, was arrested in the early morning hours of Dec. 24 after attacking a police officer in Palm Beach — nearly a year after she wed now-ex-husband Tom D’Agostino in the Florida destination.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  She was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  She had been discovered trespassing in a hotel room with an unidentified man, according to a police report. The pair had entered the wrong room at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach and refused to leave.  An assistant state’s attorney told the Palm Beach Post that de Lesseps slammed a door and kicked at least one police officer. She also reportedly told people, “I’m going to kill you all,” before her arrest.  In a statement to PEOPLE, de Lesseps — who was released on her own recognizance that same day — said, “This was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.”  A source told PEOPLE that “Luann was out with a girlfriend at the Colony Hotel where she had her wedding brunch just a year ago — it was the first time she had been back to Palm Beach since the wedding.”  “Memories from that day came flooding back, she was emotional and her behavior was out of character,” the source added.  Days after her arrest, she exclusively told PEOPLE that she would be checking herself into a treatment facility.  “After the events of last Saturday night in Palm Beach, I am truly embarrassed,” she said. “I have decided to seek professional guidance and will be voluntarily checking into an alcohol treatment center. I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event. Once again, I sincerely apologize for my actions. I have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law abiding character.”  “I am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters,” she continued.",0
"Ming Xi Breaking Down in Tears After Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show Fall She took a tumble while on the catwalk in Shanghai.  Model Ming Xi took a tumble during the 2017 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, which was filmed on Nov. 20. Originally, it was reported that the fall would not be televised, but it was shown on Tuesday night’s CBS broadcast, reports E News. It appears that the 28-year-old model got tangled in her flowing, sheer ensemble.  But the Chinese model was a total pro, and did not let the fall affect her on stage. She kept a smile on the whole time, and even seemed to laugh at herself as she adjusted her hair and continued to walk down the catwalk. She received applause from the other models and the audience, reports E News.  It’s not about how we fall, it’s about how we get up. #VSFashionShow pic.twitter.com/NCe08O8OjU — CBS (@CBS) November 29, 2017  But the backstage footage shows some completely different emotions. Once she was away from the audience, Xi burst into tears. But she didn’t suffer alone: footage shows models coming to comfort their friend.  One source told E News that “Ming was really upset when she fell on the runway. It was a hard fall. She got up as gracefully as she could. She was shaken up after that fall. All the models made her feel better after though. She is OK now.”  The source told E News that Xi is “one of the favorites” to walk the Victoria’s Secret runway and that it is every model’s “worst nightmare to fall.” But the source also said that models “embrace each other” if anything unexpected, like Xi’s fall, happens and that they are all “a team.”  Xi addressed the fall on Instagram.  And let’s be honest, we all wish we looked as good as Xi does when we stumble.  Read full story at E News",0
"Multiple tabloids have been reporting that there is something going on between Robert Pattinson and Emma Watson, leading fans to believe that there could be some merit to the story. Then, after the pair presented together at the Golden Globe Awards, reports surfaced that the two went public with their relationship. But, fans will be disappointed to find out that there is no truth to the story, and the claims that Pattinson and Watson are dating are completely false.  The problem is, celebrities don’t choose who they present with at an awards show. So, the fact that Pattinson and Watson shared a few minutes on stage together in no way means the two are in a relationship. The pair presented the award for Best TV Movie or Limited Series, which went to HBO’s Big Little Lies.  Now, there is a new twist to the rumor, with another publication telling a tall tale about Pattinson propositioning Watson for a one-night stand.  #RobertPattinson opens up: ""This Halloween I walked into the most extreme, ah, fancy dress party. I was absolutely normcore and it was the most humiliating experience of my life."" https://t.co/KWcnK4pU3w — W magazine (@wmag) January 19, 2018  The false story, which appeared in Star magazine, alleged that Pattinson has had a crush on Watson since they starred together in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire back in 2005. It then went on to claim that Pattinson used a terrible pick-up line by asking her, “Do you want to hang out at my house, you know, like overnight?”  The so-called eyewitness then says that, since Watson isn’t a one-night stand type of girl, she made a face like she had eaten some rotten food and ran away.  But, the incident simply never happened. Reps for both Watson and Pattinson say that the two actors had fun at the awards ceremony, but he didn’t hit on her and she didn’t reject him.  Today at the @womensmarch LA I was carrying this sign and all of a sudden I look over and see EMMA WATSON staring at me from 3ft away. She waved, motioned that she loved my sign, and then I cried. I will NEVER be this cool again guys ✨? pic.twitter.com/RAzM6WZVr8 — Molly Pasquarella (@Molly_Pasqui) January 21, 2018  Once Watson split from her boyfriend, entrepreneur William “Mack” Knight, back in November, meaning both she and Pattinson were single, tabloids started to randomly tie the two together just three weeks later. Once one outlet fabricated the romantic connection, others picked it up and copied the story. But, it is all complete fiction.  Watson and Pattinson have not been secretly texting or meeting up in London and Los Angeles. They are simply friends and nothing more.  Advertisement  This isn’t the first time that rumors have spread about the former co-stars. Back in 2009, the same story flew around Hollywood, but Emma Watson shut it down by saying that Robert Pattinson is just a good friend and a super-nice guy, adding he is great to work with.",0
"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people, and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops.Frank Parlato, a former NXIVM publicist-turned-whistleblower told the New York Post that Bronfman is among the harshest leaders in the organization.“She’s the enforcer—the brutal one. Clare’s running the [operation] now, and she’s the most ruthless of them. I’m issuing an absolute warning now. Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there’s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her.” Parlato said.Of Allison Mack, Parlato said that she was a troubled woman, who was both a victim and an abuser.“Mack was both a victim and a victimizer. She was both a mastermind and Raniere’s useful idiot. She started as a slave and she became a slave master. Her nickname among defectors is ‘Pimp Mack,‘” Parlato said.It is highly possible that this is a position that Mack was groomed for since she was a child, as many childhood stars turn from victims to predators as a result of what they often experience behind the scenes in the industry. Oddly enough, one of Mack’s very first roles was in a softcore porn movie called “Night Eyes Three.” She was just 11 years old at the time.Below you can see the full charges against Mack and Raniere here.",0

"NEW YORK (AP) — Jada Pinkett Smith is calling the Tupac Shakur biopic “All Eyez on Me” ″deeply hurtful” for its portrayal of her relationship with the rap legend.  In a series of tweets Friday, just as the film is opening in theaters, Pinkett Smith contradicted several scenes. She said she never had an argument with Shakur backstage, that their parting was fictionalized and that he never read her a poem, as seen in the film. Pinkett Smith said her relationship to Shakur was “too precious” for her not take issue.  Pinkett Smith was close friends from childhood with Shakur. She’s portrayed in the film by Kat Graham, whose performance Pinkett Smith complimented, along with Demetrius Shipp Jr., who plays Shakur.  The filmmakers of “All Eyez on Me” didn’t immediately comment Friday.",0

"A coparenting nightmare! Maci Bookout confessed during part one of the Teen Mom OG reunion episode that she believes Ryan Edwards is doing drugs. The two wouldn’t even get along to talk out their problems on stage during the explosive episode that aired on MTV on Monday, April 16. Also, Catelynn Lowell talked about her suicidal thoughts and treatment while Amber Portwood admitted to relapsing after her breakup from Matt Baier. Check out the biggest moments from the dramatic reunion below.  Maci Thinks Ryan Is Using Again  Maci and Ryan each got their chance to talk about yet another tumultuous year attempting to coparent. Maci has been asking her ex to take a drug test nearly all season so he could see their child, but said she doesn’t believe he is clean.  However, Ryan completely disagrees. “I wonder if she believes the lies she tells?” Ryan muttered backstage.  He talked about his struggle with rehab, admitting that he ended his treatment early and hasn’t really done any post-rehab therapy to help control his addiction. “I didn’t know how I was going to get out and actually stay clean,” Ryan said.  When it was time for the two to come together onstage, Ryan wouldn’t have any of it. “I’m not sitting out here with her,” he said. Hopefully, he calms down during part two so they can try to work out some of their problems.  Amber Discussed Her Relapse  Amber Skyped in to talk about her life, including her dramatic breakup from Matt. She was in such a dark place after being “mentally and physically” abused by him for years that she stumbled in her sobriety and started drinking again. “I definitely was trying to drown my sorrows,” Amber said.  Also, she gushed about Andrew Glennon, the father of her soon-to-be born baby, adding that he is her soul mate and, in a way, saved her life. “He really picked me up before I started doing drugs again,” Amber said. “If it wasn’t for Andrew, I don’t even know if I would be here right now.”  Catelynn and Maci Diss Farrah  Maci and Catelynn were the only two moms physically at the reunion, so they got a chance to discuss Farrah Abraham‘s exit from the show without fear of being attacked by their former costar.  “I feel like she’s always wanted to go down the direction she’s going down so if that’s what she wants to do then that’s probably what she needs to stay doing,” Catelynn said.  Maci was not as diplomatic and said it was so much “nicer” to do the reunion without Farrah there, adding that they also “weren’t really allowed” to talk to Farrah’s daughter. Someone is still bitter!  Catelynn Talks About Her Depression  Catelynn discussed her difficult year — her miscarriage, her suicidal thoughts and being in treatment away from her family. The hardest part for her was thinking about everything she put her daughter, Novalee, through this season.  “When I was in treatment, I struggled with the fact that ‘Am I putting her through the same stuff that my parents put me through?'” Catelynn cried.  She also added that since she returned from treatment, her daughter is constantly scared her mom is going to leave her. “It breaks my heart,” Catelynn said.

"Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores  Photography by​ Philip Cosores  Well, they did it: Radiohead performed “Creep” at Coachella. It wasn’t the first time it’s been heard on this field – the band introduced it deep in their 2004 Coachella debut and Prince incorporated it in his storied 2008 set in terrific extended-shred style. But tonight’s rendition – the main set closer of a 22-song set, which marked the band’s fourth Indio appearance following stellar dual weekends in 2012 – was epic. When Jonny Greenwood hit the palm mute before the distortion kicked in on the first chorus, it was louder than the sound of a shotgun cocking.  Good damn thing it sounded so tremendous – unleashing the rare live gem was the necessary cherry on top of a spectacular rally after undergoing unprecedented sound problems, the worst in Coachella headliner history.  The set began as magically as one might imagine, with bright white pistons of light swirling around the group during airy A Moon Shaped Pool kickoffs “Daydreaming” and the acoustic-led “Desert Island Disk”. But the revelry was halted when, about halfway through third song “Ful Stop”, there was an abrupt buzz and pop – like the sound of a guitar cable coming loose but much louder – followed by a brief outage. That was forgivable. These things happen, and the band took it in stride (“Fucking aliens again,” joked Thom Yorke). But two songs later, well into In Rainbows staple “15 Step”, the sound dropped out once again … and didn’t come back. The band played through to the end, seemingly unaware, as their fans could hear nothing.  After a brief intermission to solve the issue, they roused heartfelt cheers by returning triumphantly with the otherworldly prog-jazz of “The National Anthem”, and for a moment, as they launched into “Let Down”, it seemed like everything was gonna be OK. But for the first time ever (I can’t believe I’m typing this) that classic OK Computer fave fully lived up to its name – the sound kicked the bucket mid-song, and one of the biggest collective groans I’ve ever heard at a festival rose up as the band again played through almost the entire track without realizing it was no longer blasting from the speakers.  “I’m having audio anxiety,” exclaimed one exasperated fan. “I have an actual fear of the music stopping again.”  For a moment, it appeared that what should’ve been one of the most landmark sets of the weekend might end up a complete disaster. True, anyone who was on the fence about seeing Radiohead probably bailed at this point – the audience visibly thinned out by the thousands during the downtime. But over the course of the next hour or so, with all sound issues resolved, Radiohead more than made up for the pauses with a superb set crowned by “Creep”, which was followed by a standout encore of “You and Whose Army?” – replete with a larger-than-life close-up of Yorke’s eye, simultaneously the most wonderfully intimate and terribly uncomfortable sight – alongside the rollicking “Bodysnatchers” and galvanic sing-along “Karma Police”.  Sound problems like these are cringe-worthy for any fest headliner, but in this case, it worked to the performers’ advantage. The snafu provided a rare glimpse of a more humanized Radiohead – they’re not as invincible as some people make them out to be, but they still proved some level of omnipotence by persevering with the asset that launched them to stardom in the first place: fucking great rock music.  Setlist:  Daydreaming  Desert Island Disk  Ful Stop  Airbag  15 Step  The National Anthem  Let Down  Street Spirit (Fade Out)  Bloom  Identikit  Everything in Its Right Place  There There  Weird Fishes/Arpeggi  Burn the Witch  Idioteque  Nude  Creep  Encore:  You and Whose Army?

"A mosque in Georgia is under fire after they solicited donations allegedly for victims of Hurricane Harvey but decided to keep them and send them to a different kind of refugee instead.“Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter,” said Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton. “Allah has told us that we must consider where the need is greater and respond to it.”The mosque recently made headlines for its “Good work” in the community. According to news reports at the time, the mosque had raised more than $340,000 in cash and supplies “for the victims of Hurricane Harvey.” All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to “help” people in refugee camps, which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment.“We intended to send it to the people impacted by the hurricane,” Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community. “But after much prayer, Allah told us that we must help the people who need it most.”Residents are outraged, demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that.[adrotate banner=""3""]It’s time for us to stop tolerating this stuff and make our voices heard!",0

"Miranda Lambert’s life in Oklahoma with Blake Shelton was harder than anyone thought. Following the success of Lambert’s latest album, The Weight of These Wings, the country star revealed that she struggled just making it through her daily life while living on Shelton’s sprawling ranch.  Lambert admitted that things got so rough with Shelton that it started to affect her music. She recalled a time when she was contracted to write a car commercial song and she barely got it done in time. It was at that moment that she realized something needed to change.  “I remember I had to write a song for a Dodge RAM commercial. It was hard. I barely got it out, and I was like, ‘Man, I need some fuel. I have to go fall in love with it again,’” she explained. “So Nashville does that for me.”  Lambert and Shelton have been separated for close to two years. Although Lambert has been more open about the split this year, she doesn’t like talking about the breakup. Instead, the country star lets her music do the talking.  “If you want to hear my side of the story or my opinion of what happened, it’s all on there,” she shared. “There’s no mystery anymore—take from it what you will.”  Speaking of her music, People reports that Lambert did not want to write a typical breakup album. Instead, Lambert wanted to sing about everything that was going on in her life at the moment, including the good and bad.  “I walked in with guns blazing,” Lambert explained. “I just knew one thing: I didn’t want a breakup record. I was like, ‘Let’s feel it all.’ I was ready to have the days where I can’t even stand up and the days where I’m celebrating.”  You ain’t missing nothing, love is so damn hard, take it from me darlin’, you don’t want a heart. -Miranda Lambert pic.twitter.com/38A9WOBKpW — Country Music Quotes (@Country_Voices) July 27, 2017  Lambert added that she doesn’t always feel as confident and fiery as she lets on. While she has her ups and down like anyone else, Lambert explained how the split changed her perspective on life. Lambert no longer takes emotional hardship for granted and understands herself at a deeper level.  While Lambert is still enjoying the success of her latest album, she has found love with boyfriend Anderson East. The couple is currently enjoying their romance in Nashville and Lambert occasionally takes a break on her massive farm close to the city limits.  She may have been bored on Shelton’s ranch, but Lambert enjoys her time alone on the farm, where she can wear whatever she wants and spend all day playing with her dogs.  Although Lambert isn’t afraid to sing about most subjects, she doesn’t like to write about politics. In fact, Lambert believes bringing politics into music just creates a divide amongst fans who just want to have a good time.

"It’s not a nice thing to tell someone they should be ashamed of themselves, Cyrus told Jimmy Kimmel about being pressured to apologize for exposing the skin of her back at age 15.  Miley Cyrus doesn’t worry about yesterday. She doesn’t even care about tomorrow. And she certainly isn't losing any sleep over a scantily clad photo of herself published 10 years ago.  Earlier this week, the pop singer retracted her apology for a controversial photo published in Vanity Fair back in 2008. Her curt Twitter retort still stands: ""IM NOT SORRY. Fuck YOU."" But there’s more.  In a Tuesday night interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Cyrus took a swipe at the New York Post, the POTUS, and everyone who points the finger of shame. ""I never really keep track of the years that have gone by since something like this,"" she said, with a nod to a printout of the resurfaced Post headline about the photo shoot.  ""A lot of things have changed and I think the conversation has changed a lot.... Sure, some people thought I did something wrong in their eyes. But I think it was really wrong of someone to put on top of someone that this is my shame and that I should be ashamed of myself,"" she continued. ""It’s not a nice thing to tell someone they should be ashamed of themselves. Except Donald Trump.""  She also recounted the photo session when, at the age of 15, Cyrus worked with renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz for the Vanity Fair feature. ""There was nothing sexualized about this on set,"" the former Hannah Montana star said. ""It was every one’s poisonous thoughts and minds that ended up turning this into something that wasn’t meant to be. So actually, I should not be ashamed, they should be.""  Cyrus covered a lot of turf during her Q&A with Kimmel, from the thin line between ""hoarding"" and ""collecting,"" her special packet of peanuts, living with Liam Hemsworth and her ""new projects"" in Los Angeles. She kept those plans under wraps, but they’re apparently so important, she gave up smoking pot (her ""first true love"") to ""stay focused.""  Check out more clips from Miley’s appearance below.

"How much did you spend on your actual home? Well, Miranda Kerr has already spent that much on the nursery for her unborn child, according to a new report.  Kento Nara/Future Image/WENN.com  A source told Life & Style that the model and her husband, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, have already dropped $250,000 on the nursery.  The insider tells the mag that the couple is ""super excited"" about welcoming a child into their lives, adding that the baby's nursery contains a custom-made crib and a walk-in closet filled with designer baby clothes from Dior, Stella McCartney, and Ralph Lauren.

'Neither one of us is dead, neither one of us is looking to throw hatchets at each other. It's more like, it's amicable. It's boring, but, you know, we respected each other enough that it was as painless as it could be.

"Selena Gomez has been working on herself since her latest split from Justin Bieber, but it’s not going as planned. Friends are worried the 25-year-old is on a downward spiral and actually “is a mess,” a source tells OK! Magazine.  Even prior to her breakup, Selena’s been very open about struggles she faces, including depression and anxiety, and goes to therapy on a regular basis to work on her battles.  And the split, which of course happened in front of the world, didn’t help matters. Says the insider, “She went from being on top of the world to dealing with nonstop relationship drama. She feels so demoralized and alone.”  On top of that, because her mother Mandy doesn’t particularly like Justin, Selena reportedly chose to end things because she could not take the burden of having her mom at odds with her.  Unfortunately, that choice backfired. The source added, “Selena now feels a lot of resentment toward Mandy about the decision she made, and they’re barely speaking. So she’s essentially lost the two main influences in her life, which could be a recipe for disaster.  What are your thoughts on Selena’s spiral? Let us know in the comments section.",1
"The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is an American and former actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex.[1] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[2][3]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[4] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[5]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[6] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[7] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[8]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[8]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[9][10] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[7][11]  Markle is the second American[note 2] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[12] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[13][14][15][16][17]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[18] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[19][20]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[21] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[22] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living spouse since 2002.[23][24] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[25] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[26] but Kensington Palace have indicated that the decision on whether she will retain dual nationality has not yet been made.[25] Retaining U.S. citizenship is expected to create tax complications.[27] The couple was invited to celebrate Christmas 2017 with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham estate.[28] The official engagement photographs were taken by Alexi Lubomirski (a former assistant to Mario Testino) at Frogmore House, and were issued by Kensington Palace on 21 December 2017.[29]  To mark the wedding of Harry and Meghan, the Royal Mint produced an official UK £5 coin, showing the couple in profile.[30] In May, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[31]  Wedding [ edit ]  Planning [ edit ]  Preparation for wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the wedding day of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was not declared a bank holiday.[32] The wedding was on the same date as the FA Cup Final, which Prince Harry's brother William normally attends in his role as President of the Football Association.[33] Holding the royal wedding on a weekend is a break with the royal tradition of having weddings on a weekday.[34] On 12 February 2018, Kensington Palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 12:00 Midday BST.  Venue [ edit ]  The wedding took place on Saturday, 19 May 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor.[35] The chapel had previously been the venue for the weddings of Prince Harry's uncle, the Earl of Wessex, as well as that of his cousin, Peter Phillips, and for the blessing of the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Harry's stepmother.[36]  Cost [ edit ]  The royal family announced that they would pay for the wedding.[37] The costs for the cake, the florist, and the catering had been estimated to be £50,000, £110,000, and £286,000 respectively,[38] and the overall cost was expected to be around £32 million.[39] The security costs were expected to be lower than those of the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.[40] By the end of May, it was estimated that the security costs were ""between £2 million and £4 million"". The police and crime commissioner could also apply for special funding if the costs were to exceed 1% of the Thames Valley Police force's annual budget, but at the time the cost was ""well below the £4 million required to make a claim"".[41] The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead reportedly spent £2.6 million on cleaning the town and roads.[40] It was predicted that the wedding would trigger a tourism boom and boost the economy by up to £500 million.[42]  Wedding attire [ edit ]  The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of ""Dress Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit""; for women, ""Day Dress and Hat"".[43]  Bride and bridesmaids [ edit ]  The wedding dress was designed by the British designer Clare Waight Keller under the aegis of the fashion house Givenchy.[44] It was made of ""double-bonded silk cady cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza"" and had a boat neckline, long sleeves and sweeping train.[45][46] The silk veil was 16 feet (4.9 m) long and was embroidered with 55 flowers, representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[45][47] as well as Wintersweet, which grows in front of Nottingham Cottage, where she and Harry live, and the California Poppy, the state flower of California.[48] It was secured by a diamond bandeau tiara, made in 1932 for Queen Mary and lent to Markle by Queen Elizabeth II.[45][49] The centre brooch had been a wedding gift from the County of Lincoln in 1893. The tiara is a platinum band, made up of eleven sections, a detachable centre brooch with interlaced opals and diamonds.[50] The shoes were also from Givenchy, and had a pointed couture design.[45]  Other ensembles worn by the bride included white gold and diamond earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.[45][49][51] Markle's hair was rolled up with ""face-framing fringe tucked behind her ears"",[52] and was done by Serge Normant.[53] Make-up artist Daniel Martin did Markle's makeup for the occasion.[52][54] The look was described as ""a soft brown eyeshadow"" with minimal makeup on the face.[52] Her nails were painted in a ""neutral pink-y beige"" for the ceremony.[55] The bride's bouquet, designed by Philippa Craddock, contained ""forget-me-nots, scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia, and sprigs of myrtle"".[45] The flowers were chosen by the groom who handpicked forget-me-nots in honour of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales.[45][56] After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother.[57] For the customary bridal themes of ""Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue"", Markle had her gown and veil (the ""new""), the Queen's tiara (the ""borrowed""), sprigs of myrtle taken from ""a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen's wedding bouquet"" and a piece of fabric from Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown (the ""old""), and finally a piece of fabric from the dress she wore on their first date stitched in the veil (the ""blue"").[58][59][60] The young bridesmaids also wore high-waisted silk dresses designed by Clare Waight Keller which had puff sleeves.[61]  Groom, best man and page boys [ edit ]  Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) in which both were commissioned,[note 3] and Prince Harry served for 10 years, including in combat in Afghanistan.[62] The uniforms were made by Dege & Skinner, gentleman's tailors and uniform makers, of Savile Row, London.[63][64] The groom asked for and received the Queen's permission to keep his beard, as beards are only permitted under exceptional circumstances in the British Army.[62] Prince Harry wore the rank of major with the star of the Royal Victorian Order, of which he is a Knight Commander, along with the ribbons of the Royal Victorian Order, Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Army Air Corps wings.[65] Prince William, also with the rank of major, had EIIR cyphers on his shoulder straps and gold aiguillettes on his right shoulder (indicating his position as an aide-de-camp to the Queen), and wore the star of the Order of the Garter, the ribbons of the two jubilee medals, and his RAF wings.[63][66] The pageboys wore uniforms by Dege & Skinner that resembled the uniform of the Blues and Royals worn by the groom and best man. Each page boy had his initials on the shoulders in place of rank badges.[63]  Wedding party [ edit ]  On 26 April 2018, Kensington Palace announced that Prince Harry had selected his older brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, as his best man.[67][68] There was initially no confirmation as to whether Prince William would miss the FA Cup Final, which he would normally attend in his role as President of The Football Association, or if he would be able to attend both the wedding and the football. A statement from Kensington Palace that the timing of the wedding would not clash with the match was released in December 2017.[69] However, it was confirmed in March that the Duke would not be attending the final that day.[70]  There were suggestions that the bride's friend Jessica Mulroney would be her maid of honour.[71][72] In early May 2018, there was confirmation that there would be no maid of honour, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children.[73] A total of ten bridesmaids and page boys were chosen, with the bride and groom each selecting five: two of Markle's godchildren, seven-year old Rylan Ritt and her six-year-old sister Remi, as well as Brian, John and Ivy Mulroney, the three children of her friend Jessica Mulroney, were chosen by the bride, while Prince Harry's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as his godchildren Florence van Cutsem, Zalie Warren and Jasper Dyer, were selected by the groom.[74][75]  On 18 May 2018, Kensington Palace announced Prince Charles would accompany Markle down the aisle, after she confirmed her father, Thomas Markle Sr., would not be attending the wedding due to his recent heart surgery.[76][77] The bride spent the night before the wedding at Cliveden House along with her mother, while the groom stayed at Coworth Park Hotel with his brother.[78][79] Markle made her way to the church accompanied by her mother.[80]  Approximately 250 members of the British Armed Forces were involved in the wedding, the majority coming from units that have a connection with Prince Harry:[81]  Wedding service [ edit ]  The wedding service was conducted according to the Christian liturgy for Holy Matrimony as set out in Common Worship of the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion.[3]  From 8.00 am, the public started to arrive at the grounds of Windsor Castle. The main congregation and the guests[84] all started to arrive at the chapel at 9.30 am, followed by members of the Royal Family. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is tradition, arriving at the chapel at 11.52 am.[85] Shortly after, Markle arrived with the party of junior attendants. She proceeded down the aisle followed by the attendants, where the Prince of Wales met her to escort her through the quire of the chapel. He accompanied her to the altar, where Prince Harry was standing.[86][87]  Prince Harry's maternal aunt, Baroness Fellowes, read a scripture lesson from The Song of Solomon in the Christian Bible. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the service with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performing the marriage ceremony. The sermon was delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (the American member church of the Anglican Communion).[88][89] Curry's 14-minute address, which quoted Martin Luther King Jr., emphasised the redemptive property of love;[90][91] its unexpected length caused the service to overrun by eight minutes.[92] Chaplain to the Queen The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin and Coptic Orthodox Archbishop of London Anba Angaelos offered the prayers.[93]  The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise to ""to love and to cherish"" each other.[94] This was sealed by the exchange of rings.[94] The wedding rings were created by Cleave and Company, with Markle's ring being fashioned out of Welsh gold and the Prince's ring made of platinum.[95] After the signing of the registers, Harry and Markle together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle.[96] They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families.[94] The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel.[97]  Music [ edit ]  Hymns sung at the wedding included Lord of All Hopefulness and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer.[98] Prince Harry was seen wiping away a tear during the congregational singing of the latter, which was a favourite of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and was sung at her funeral in 1997;[99] it was also the opening hymn to William's wedding in 2011.  Two choirs, an orchestra, the chapel organ and fanfare trumpeters provided music for the service. The orchestra was made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In addition to the Choir of St George's Chapel, the Kingdom Choir, a gospel group led by Karen Gibson, sang ""Stand By Me"" in what was described as ""an incredible and powerful moment"".[100] The State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry, who played a fanfare, included Kate Sandford, the first female state trumpeter at a British royal wedding.[101] The music was under the overall direction of James Vivian, the chapel's Organist and Director of Music; and the orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green.[102][103]  The bride walked down the aisle to ""Eternal source of light divine"" (from the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne) by Handel, sung by soprano Elin Manahan Thomas, with the trumpet obbligato performed by David Blackadder.[104] Other music during the service included the motet ""If Ye Love Me"" by Thomas Tallis; the song ""Stand by Me"" by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and Ben E. King, arranged for choir by Mark Delisser; and ""The Lord bless you and keep you"" by John Rutter. During the signing of the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and the orchestra played Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis, Fauré's Après un rêve, and an arrangement for cello and orchestra of Schubert's Ave Maria. For the procession, the musicians performed the Allegro from the Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major by William Boyce and ""This Little Light of Mine"" by Etta James, Jester Hairston and Harry Dixon Loes.[105]  Family celebrations [ edit ]  St George's Hall, Windsor Castle Frogmore House  Following the ceremony, there was a carriage procession through Windsor. Two receptions were held; the first, for those attending the ceremony, was hosted by the Queen and took place in St George's Hall after the carriage procession. Singer Elton John performed for the guests and the groom and the Prince of Wales each gave a speech.[62] A second reception at Frogmore House, for family and close friends and hosted by the Prince of Wales, occurred later in the day.[88] Harry drove his new wife to the reception at Frogmore in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, with left-hand drive. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Sussex wore a halter-neck, open back dress by Stella McCartney and an emerald cut Aquamarine ring formerly belonging to Diana, Princess of Wales.[106][107] George Northwood was her hairstylist for the private party.[107] In a break with tradition, the bride made a speech at the event.[62] The Duke of Cambridge also gave a best man's speech. DJ Idris Elba and The Atlantic Soul Orchestra performed at the event.[108][109][110] The event ended with small fireworks displayed above Frogmore House.[111]  The wedding cake was a layered lemon and elderflower cake and decorated with peonies in shades of white and cream.[112] The cake designer Claire Ptak, based in London, was chosen in March 2018.[113]  Three official wedding photos were released. They were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Windsor Castle following the ceremony.[114]  Guests [ edit ]  In April 2018, it was announced that an ""official list"" of domestic and international political leaders was not required for the wedding and that Prime Minister Theresa May, Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and other leaders would not attend the ceremony. President of the United States Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama were also not invited.[115] This was in contrast to the wedding of Prince Harry's elder brother, which had a large number of such guests due to his position as a future monarch.[116] The decision not to invite political leaders to the wedding was taken in part because of the limitations of the venue, and also took into account Prince Harry's position as sixth in line to the throne.[116] The only politician invited was the former Prime Minister Sir John Major as he previously was ""a special guardian on legal matters to Princes William and Harry after the death of their mother"".[62]  With a smaller ceremony and reception at St George's Hall, the guest list included approximately 600 people, most of whom have a ""direct relationship"" with the couple.[117] Also, 200 close friends of the couple were invited to attend the evening reception at Frogmore House.[118] Approximately 1,200 members of the public were invited to greet the couple outside the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.[117] The invitees outside the chapel were ""people from charities, Windsor Castle community members, people from the royal households and the Crown Estate, and local school children"".[119]  Sarah, Duchess of York, the former wife of Prince Andrew, was invited to the wedding even though she had not been invited to the weddings of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008, or Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in 2011. However, she was not invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles and was reportedly ""deeply upset"" by her omission.[120]  Amongst the non-royal guests were Markle's Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams (with wife Troian Bellisario), Gabriel Macht (with wife Jacinda Barrett), Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer, actors George Clooney (with wife Amal Clooney), Idris Elba and Tom Hardy, actresses Oprah Winfrey, Priyanka Chopra and Carey Mulligan (with husband Marcus Mumford), television host James Corden, tennis player Serena Williams (with husband Alexis Ohanian), David and Victoria Beckham, musicians Sir Elton John (with husband David Furnish), James Blunt, Joss Stone, and rugby players Jonny Wilkinson and James Haskell. Megan's close friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney (with husband Ben Mulroney) and Harry's ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy were also in attendance. Other guests were members of the Middleton family.[121][122][123][124][125]  The only foreign royal guests at the wedding were Prince Harry's friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded, after the death of both of their mothers, the Sentebale foundation to help AIDS-stricken orphans in Lesotho, and his wife Princess Mabereng.[126]  Gifts for guests [ edit ]  The 2,640 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were gifted gift bags to commemorate the event. The bag had the initials of the couple, date and venue location printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet for the wedding, a gold chocolate coin, a bottle of water, a fridge magnet, a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop and a tube of handbag shortbread.[127]  Charitable donations [ edit ]  In April 2018, the couple requested that, rather than sending wedding gifts, people should make a donation to one of seven charitable organisations, none of which they had a formal association with:[128][129]  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association): The small charity supports more than 1,000 young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland.  Crisis: The national homeless body works with thousands of people a year to help rebuild their lives.  The Myna Mahila Foundation: The organisation, based in Mumbai, helps empower women through offering stable employment and breaking cultural taboos around menstrual hygiene. Myna Mahila also teaches women life skills such as maths, English and self-defence.  Scotty's Little Soldiers: The charity supports children who have lost a parent while serving in the British Armed Forces.  StreetGames: The organisation uses sport to help young people and communities become healthier and safer.  Surfers Against Sewage: The national marine conservation body works to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife.  The Wilderness Foundation UK: Vulnerable teenagers from urban communities are taught about the great outdoors and rural employment opportunities.  Coverage [ edit ]  People watching the wedding at the official residence of the UK Ambassador to Italy, in Rome  Peak viewing figures of 18 million were reported in the UK.[130] About 29 million were reported to have watched in the United States, up from the 23 million Americans who watched the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.[131] The global audience was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.[132]  Coverage of the royal wedding in the UK was shown on BBC One, ITV, Sky News, CNN (International) and E! (Europe) [133] The wedding was also streamed live online on YouTube via the British Monarchy's official The Royal Channel.[134] Huw Edwards hosted coverage for BBC TV with Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young and BBC Radio 2 DJ Dermot O'Leary. The BBC Radio coverage was co-hosted by Chris Evans and Scarlett Moffatt.[135] Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham hosted coverage for ITV.[136] Kay Burley, Anna Botting and Alastair Bruce, among others, hosted coverage for Sky.[137]  CBC broadcast the wedding in Canada with Adrienne Arsenault and retired broadcaster Peter Mansbridge presented live coverage that was simulcast on CBC Television, CBC Radio One and CBC News Network.[138] TVNZ screened it in New Zealand along with SBS and Nine in Australia.[133][139] The wedding received 4 million views in Australia.[140]  In Fiji, Fiji Television broadcast the event via BBC with coverage starting from 8:30 pm FJT on 19 May and finishing at 12:30 am on 20 May, when it switched back to normal programming.  In the United States coverage aired on CBS, NBC, ABC, E!, PBS, BBC America, TLC, FOX, and HBO.[141] CBS's coverage began at 4 a.m. EDT with CBS Presents ""The Royal Wedding""[142] and Gayle King provided commentary during the broadcast. ABC began its coverage at 5 a.m. EDT with a special edition of Good Morning America.[143] NBC aired the ceremony at 4:30 a.m. EDT with a special edition of The Today Show.[144] The pay subscription network HBO hosted a live broadcast titled ""The Royal Wedding Live with Cord and Tish!"" starting at 7:30 a.m. EDT.[145] The parody hosts were Cord Hosenbeck and Tish Cattigan, the alter egos of former Saturday Night Live actors Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon. BBC America provided a live simulcast of BBC One's coverage, albeit with limited commercial breaks.[146]  The wedding was also aired on the Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster RTÉ.[147]  Comments in a ""posh"" British accent by a self-claimed British expert on some media turned out to be by an American, Thomas Mace-Archer-Mills.[148]  Titles [ edit ]  Traditionally, royal princes have been awarded peerages prior to their marriages; this occurred with both of Prince Harry's uncles, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex, as well as his elder brother, the Duke of Cambridge.[149] Hours before the wedding, Prince Harry was granted the titles Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel, and Markle assumed the style ""Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex"" upon marriage.[1]  Reactions [ edit ]  British reactions to a mixed-race American marrying into the British royal family ( Voice of America  The wedding was widely reported as being significant for its departure from tradition typically associated with the Royal Family and for its inclusion of African-American culture in the service.[150][151][152][153][154] It was described as a ""landmark for African Americans"", for Black British, black and mixed-race women, and for the Royal Family itself.[155][156][157][158] Other reports cited more limited impact, including that ""Markle being biracial as opposed to African American impeded black people embracing her as one of their own"".[159][160]  The wedding, particularly Markle's choice of dress, as well as the cake and flowers, influenced the choices of other British brides for their weddings.[161]  Honeymoon [ edit ]  The couple did not leave for their honeymoon the day after their marriage, and were both scheduled to carry out public engagements in the week after the wedding.[162] The location of the honeymoon has been kept secret, although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as Namibia, Rwanda, and Botswana.[163][164][165]  See also [ edit ]",0
"Chrissy Teigen doesn’t mind calling out her husband for the whole world to see.  The supermodel took to Twitter to roast John Legend for stealing all ― yes, all ― of her phone chargers.  “Yes @johnlegend I buy and leave all the phone chargers all around the house just so you can unplug them all and take them to work with you. all of them!” Teigen wrote on Wednesday, her words dripping with sarcasm. “I love that you love chargers! they’re all for you! I just love you that’s why I buy them. because you love them!”  The “Lip Sync Battle” commentator tweeted then that she was going to purchase a unicorn charger so Legend might avoid taking it:  @johnlegend take this one u thief — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 8, 2018  As one Twitter user put it, the two are facing a “power struggle.”  It sounds like the two of you are facing a bit of a... power struggle.    I'll show myself out. — Jon S. (@SleepiestNinja) February 8, 2018  But clearly, the charger-stealing scenario hit a nerve with people in relationships.  “Orange Is the New Black” star Ruby Rose tweeted at her girlfriend, Jessica Veronica of The Veronicas, and called her out for doing the same thing as Legend:  @Jessicaveronica lol .. You. You are why I need 50000 chargers on my rider. — Ruby Rose (@RubyRose) February 8, 2018  Many others shared their power struggles:  This is marriage summed up in one tweet. — Katie👸🏼 (@katiemylady__) February 8, 2018  I’m married to the same kind of person. Who knew so many men loved chargers this way. Nothing makes my day like frantically looking for a charger when I’m on 2%. And he has them all. Every single one for one phone. — lynnethedreamer (@lynne816) February 8, 2018  pretty sure this is a universal husband/ wife struggle. 😂😂 — Pamela Phillips (@pameladphillips) February 8, 2018  This battle over wall chargers is so relatable lol https://t.co/gq17fYoPES — KristinLasVegas (@KristinLasVegas) February 8, 2018  Teigen has never shied away from calling out Legend on social media. When the musician posted a beautiful ― but low-quality ― photo on Instagram for his wife’s birthday, Teigen simply commented “How about a hi-res,” a reference to the blurriness of the picture.  They also use outlets like Twitter to help each other, like the time Teigen seemingly couldn’t find one of the couple’s toilets (yes, really). Luckily, Legend knew what happened and tweeted an explanation.  And despite all the charger-stealing and blurry pictures, Teigen told Us Weekly in a 2016 interview why she won’t ever leave Legend.",0
"Justin Bieber is smitten! The singer confirmed his engagement to Hailey Baldwin with a lengthy Instagram post about their future together.  “Was gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast, listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you!” Bieber captioned a black-and-white photo of the couple on Monday, July 9. “So committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindLY. I promise to lead our family with honor and integrity letting Jesus through his Holy Spirit guide us in everything we do and every decision we make. My heart is COMPLETELY and FULLY YOURS and I will ALWAYS put you first!”  “You are the love of my life Hailey Baldwin and I wouldn’t want to spend it with anybody else.

The thing I am most excited for is that my little brother and sister get to see another healthy stable marriage and look for the same!!! Gods timing really is literally perfect, we got engaged on the seventh day of the seventh month, the number seven is the number of spiritual perfection, it’s true GOOGLE IT! Isn’t that nuts? By the way I didn’t plan that, anyways My goodness does feel good to have our future secured! WERE GONNA VE BETTER AT 70 BABY HERE WE GO! ‘He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains FAVOR from the Lord!’ This is the year of favor!!!!”  Ariana Grande, who defended Bieber’s quick engagement after the news broke, was quick to comment on the post, writing, “Hoooooraaaaaaaaaaaaaaay omg.” Us Weekly exclusively confirmed last month that the “No Tears Left to Cry” singer was engaged to Pete Davidson after a few weeks of dating. Kylie Jenner also liked the post.  Us Weekly confirmed on Sunday, July 8, that Bieber, 24, proposed to Baldwin, 21, during their recent romanic getaway in the Bahamas. Later that day, the model was spotted wearing a large diamond ring.  After dating from 2015 to 2016, Bieber and Baldwin rekindled their romance last month. Us Weekly exclusively confirmed the pair, who had stayed “best friends,” had started “hooking up again.” The twosome were first spotted together in Miami, Florida, with friends on June 8 after his March split from his on-again, off-again girlfriend Selena Gomez.

"However much Tom Hiddleston might be denying that his turn in the updated espionage thriller The Night Manager was his way of auditioning to be the next James Bond, it certainly seems fans are having none of it. Coral bookmakers in the U.K. had to suspend betting on the actor, The Guardian reports, after a huge bet launched the actor’s perceived chances from 2-1 to 1-2. Similarly, the Ireland-based independent bookmaker BoyleSports announced Sunday in a press release that they’d also been forced to suspend betting after Hiddleston’s support skyrocketed. It seems, regardless of what anyone claims, the world is really trying to will this casting decision into existence—and really, who can blame anyone for trying?  According to BoyleSports’s release, Hiddleston was the 6-4 favorite for them before the whirlwind of bets—including one four-figure online bet from the U.K. Hiddleston was his nearest rival at 5-2, followed by Idris Elba and Damian Lewis, who were tied at 5-1.  “Judging by the gamble on Tom Hiddleston we expect that it’s only a matter of days before he is announced as Daniel Craig’s replacement,” BoyleSports representative Liam Glynn said in the press release. That might be a little hyperbolic, and lacking in knowledge of how Hollywood business deals usually work, but it’s easy to see why Glynn is excited. Hiddleston speculation—and betting—has been on the rise at least since March.  Earlier this month, Hiddleston delivered a typically charming deflection of the rumors he was being eyed as Bond on The Graham Norton Show. “I promise, no one’s talked to me about it,” he said with a chuckle. It’s not the first time he’s had to deny it, and it won’t be the last. But this particular surge probably springs from the fact that a “source” told the Daily Mail that Hiddleston had been spotted meeting with Bond director Sam Mendes. Mendes, for his part, has already said he’s really done with the franchise this time following Spectre. And of course, Hiddleston’s reps have already said the storied meeting was “completely false.”  So, where does this leave Bond fans? Basically, right back where they started—waiting to find out whether or not Daniel Craig is actually done with the role, and brainstorming all of his enticing potential replacements.

"Federal Judge Peter J. Messitte has just ruled in favor of two attorney generals seeking to subpoena the Trump organization relating to President Trump unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments.D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can now subpoena the Trump organization, thereby forcing them to preserve documents in relation to President Trump’s alleged indiscretions.The case advances a very high-profile attempt to see if President Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which precludes him from receiving gifts from foreign or state governments. The Trump Organization will be compelled to comply with the court’s ruling.“This ruling is an important first step in our litigation against President Trump for unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments,” Racine said in a statement.Per the Post:Because Trump continues to benefit financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties — in some cases from clients affiliated with foreign governments — Frosh and Racine alleged in their June complaint that Trump had committed “unprecedented constitutional violations.” State spending that benefits the president may be considered a violation of the domestic emolument clause, which says the president “shall not receive” any emolument, other than fixed compensation, from “the United States, or any of them.”The Justice Department had sought to squash the subpoena earlier in September, but Judge Messitte wasn’t convinced with their argument.President Trump has been accused of profiting from the presidency, and this case will seek to prove that assertion.",1
"Rapper Rick Ross went on Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club show recently and was asked why he has never signed a female rapper to his label Maybach Music Group. His excuse? It would just be too easy to have sex with them.  He said:  You know, I never did it because I always thought, like, I would end up fucking a female rapper and fucking the business up... I’m so focused on my business. I just, I gotta be honest with you. You know, she looking good. I’m spending so much money on her photo shoots. I gotta fuck a couple times.  Advertisement  It is unfortunately not surprising that a label exec like Ross would expect sex from the artists he signs (or, in this case, doesn’t sign), especially now when the longstanding misogyny of powerful men in music is becoming more transparent in cases like Dr. Luke, R. Kelly or LA Reid. But Ross’s comments about spending so much money on photo shoots for female artists are particularly interesting.  The number of female rappers signed to major labels has been steadily dropping since the 1980s. When NPR interviewed MC Lyte—the first woman with a solo rap record on a major label—about this topic in 2014, one of the reasons she offered for the decline was the fact that signing women is risky because of the costs that add up concerning their looks: hair, makeup, photo-shoots.  And this has long been the excuse. “That’s why labels only release a new female MC every few years,” former Vibe editor-in-chief Mimi Valdes said in 2007. “They’re just too damn expensive!”  Advertisement  “Women are viewed differently because we cost more money, number one,” Nicki Minaj’s former manager Debra Antney told Vice in 2014. “A guy could look like Cyclopes’ twin and get up there and make it. He just throws on a T-shirt and some jeans and he’s fly. For us, it’s the whole glam squad—the hair, the makeup—all these things that you have to have.”  The whole thing just seems like a snake eating its own tail: you have to be professionally gorgeous to be a successful rapper, but then your gorgeousness apparently makes your male bosses want to have sex with you, and then that’s bad for your career. Seems like a good way around this would be to see women rappers as actual artists with agency?",0
"Musicians React to Mel Tillis' Death  The country music world is reacting to the death of Mel Tillis, who passed away Sunday (Nov. 19) after a long illness. He was 85.

"Caitlyn Jenner not only slammed the Kardashians, she vented about the strain of raising Kylie and Kendall Jenner. Read her extremely controversial remarks here!  Well, these comments are going to make for an awkward situation during the next extended family get-together. Caitlyn Jenner, 68, all but called her daughters Kendall Jenner, 22, and Kylie Jenner, 20, a burden all while essentially disowning the rest of the Kardashians. In a recent interview with Piers Morgan, 52, on the show Life Stories, Caitlyn said, “I don’t talk to the Kardashians anymore. The only ones I am concerned about are Kendall and Kylie. They are my biological kids. I spent 23 years carting them around.” Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did Caitlyn just summarize her role as a parent as hauling around Kylie and Kendall for over two decades? That’s a little… harsh.  We reported earlier how Caitlyn also told Piers that she didn’t trust the Kardashians, especially when it came to keeping her gender reassignment surgery a secret. She said, “It’s none of their businesses. I had already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half, OK? I didn’t want them to leak it to the press, OK? There was no reason for them to know about it, of course I didn’t trust them.” Apparently, this was the justification for her leaving the last few pages that detailed her gender reassignment surgery out of her autobiography The Secrets of My Life in a draft she sent to the Kardashians.  In less contentious news, Caitlyn’s dog Bertha who had gone missing after the roof of Caitlyn’s home had been ripped off during the severe winds that struck Southern California in December was triumphantly found the very next day.

"While a rep for the couple denies relationship problems, an insider revealed, ""he seems to always be on the prowl for women despite being married. And he even was talking about other women just weeks after their wedding!  While at dinner with his brother Val, 31, and friends in Beverly Hills, Maksim ""was talking about hot women and sizing them up,"" a source told InTouch. ""They have no shame. It seemed like they loved the idea of stealing women away from other men.""  What makes this news that much worse is that the two just welcomed an adorable boy, Shai Aleksander, last January 4th.  And Peta reportedly cannot stand his flirtation behavior. ""Not only does she get upset, but she gets very jealous,"" added the insider.  ""At this point, many of their friends think their marriage won't last.""",1
"For Gwen Stefani, her new Las Vegas residency is a lifesaver.  That is because the consistent Vegas shows allow Stefani, 48, to live the rest of her life. “As a mom, if you look at my touring for the last ten years, I haven’t really toured,” she told journalist Allison Kugel. “I toured for seven years and it’s hard with the kids because they’re in school and I’m not homeschooling, and you can’t pull them out. It’s not fair to them.  “I did my last tour because I had this unexpected life crisis and then the music came pouring out of me from that,” Stefani explained. “It was such a lifesaver and a beautiful moment for me to be able to write again. I put that tour on at the last minute and went on a summer tour with the kids. It was so much fun for them, they loved it. But it isn’t realistic.”  “The Hollaback” girl confessed her career is winding down following the release of This Is What the Truth Feels Like in 2016, her first album in 10 years.  RELATED: Gwen Stefani Reveals Fun Fact About Blake Shelton’s Ex-Girlfriend  “I’m obviously at the end of my journey of being a musician… because of my age, and I’ve been doing it for thirty-something years,” she said. “It’s perfect for me to be able to do a Vegas show because not only does it work for me as a mom, but it also works creatively.  “It’s going to be a way to express myself and do my whole catalogue of the music that defines every time period in my life; all the crises and all the joys.”  Stefani also dished on the artists that inspire and make her better. Two such names are Jennifer Lopez and Stefani’s boyfriend Blake Shelton.  “I’ve always looked up to her [Lopez] in the sense that we’re exactly the same age and I remember when No Doubt was first coming out and she hadn’t done ‘Jenny from The Block’ yet, but she had that song out, ‘Waiting for Tonight’,” Stefani recalled. “At the time I was working with Prince and he started comparing me and Jennifer.  “I didn’t even see how I was in the same category with her,” she revealed. “She was Jennifer Lopez and I was in a band called No Doubt (laughs). But now here we are both doing these residencies all these years later, and we’ve known each other through the years. She’s always invited me to her kids’ birthday parties and things like that. She is a crazy work[horse].”  Speaking of JLo’s Vegas residency, Stefani paid close attention to how the “On The Floor” singer crafted her shows.  “I was studying the production of her show. The show was incredible, and she works so hard on stage,” explained Stefani. “When I came backstage to talk to her afterwards, she comes out of the dressing room looking like a Barbie doll. She was breathtaking on stage, but when you see her up close, it’s like, ‘What?! It’s not possible. You are so gorgeous!'”  RELATED: Blake Shelton Admits He ‘Thinks About’ Marrying Gwen Stefani  When practising a performance or putting pen to paper, it helps to have a veteran singer-songwriter on standby. Fortunately for Stefani, her country crooning beau is just that.  “Obviously, he’s my best friend, so I’m bouncing stuff off him all the time,” she said of Shelton. “He’s one of those people in my life that’s super supportive and gets me motivated. There’s a whole bunch of songs about him in the show, so that’s fun.  “Like anybody with their best friend, we share everything together. I’ll tell him, ‘I picked my dancers! There were 500 girls that tried out!’ and I’ll send him videos.”  Gwen Stefani’s upcoming Las Vegas residency, Just a Girl, begins June 27 at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino.",0
"Brad Pitt reportedly thinks it's 'disgusting' that Angelina Jolie has gone public with their divorce.  The estranged couple had been working out the legalities of their split behind closed doors with a private judge.  But some of the details of their court battle have been made public and the Hollywood hunk thinks it's 'terrible' for their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, nine.  Not impressed: Brad Pitt reportedly thinks it's 'disgusting' that Angelina Jolie has gone public with their divorce because 'their children will read about it on social media'  The Blast reports that Brad, 53, thinks it's 'disgusting' that some details have been made public because some of their children are old enough to read about it on social media and has been forced to react.  The insider has told the publication that Brad is hoping Angelina will eventually see how their bitter battle is hurting the kids and put a stop to it.  Last week, Angelina denied parting ways with celebrity divorce attorney Laura Wasser and claimed Brad hadn't paid enough child support to her since their split almost two years ago and that she intends to file a request for a court order.  Troubled: Some of the details of their court battle have been made public and the Hollywood hunk thinks it's 'terrible' for their children (pictured in 2015)  Trying to make things better? The insider has told the publication that Brad is hoping Angelina will eventually see how their bitter battle is hurting the kids and put a stop to it (stock photo)  Her lawyer Samantha Bley DeJean claims that: '[Pitt] has a duty to pay child support. As of present, [Pitt] has paid no meaningful child support since separation.  'Given the informal arrangements around the payment of the children's expenses have not been regularly sustained by [Pitt] for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file an RFO [request for a court order] for the establishment of a retroactive child support order.'  The public remark led to the Fight Club star filing his own papers, in which he called Angelina's claim 'a thinly veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.'  Brad's lawyer Lance Spiegel has claimed in the papers that the actor 'loaned' his estranged wife $8million to help her purchase her current house.  Battle: Attorneys for the actress alleged last week that the actor hasn't paid 'meaningful' child support for 18 months, according to court documents  And he has contributed over $1.3m 'in bills for the benefit of [Angelina] and the minor children.'  Brad also 'adamantly disputes the contention that he has not paid child support.'  A Pitt source familiar with the situation hinted to Dailymail.com that the actor would likely fight the allegations, commenting: 'Brad always fulfills his commitments'.  He also reportedly believes her claim to the contrary was 'a thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage' according to the filing.  Later on in the day a spokesperson for Angelina explained to People why the star had requested child support to 'provide closure to the marriage in a way that clears a path toward the next stage of their lives and allows her and Brad to recommit as devoted co-parents to their children.'  Hitting back: Brad 'adamantly disputes the contention that he has not paid child support' - Angelina and the children pictured on August 13  The documents also demand that the divorce be finalized this year, with Jolie seemingly in a hurry to bring the battle to an end.  The divorce proceedings were kick started immediately after their split, but the former couple are not 'even close' to settling things because they can't agree on anything.  A source said recently: 'Brad and Angelina are not even close to settling their divorce.  'They are so hung up on dealing with the custody issues that they haven't even exchanged any financial documents yet, which is routine in divorces and one of the first steps people take in the filing process.  'There will be no settlement or resolution anytime soon. They are kind of at an impasse at this point because the focus has been on custody; nothing else has been hashed out yet.'  MailOnline has contacted a spokesperson for both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for comment.  Jolie’s net worth has been estimated at $160 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth and in 2014, she was ranked 74th highest-earning celebrity by Forbes. The same site puts Pitt's net worth at $240million.  It's been nearly two years since their shocking split was announced. Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016 citing irreconcilable differences.  It came amid allegations that Pitt had been 'rough' with one of their children on a private plane. Pitt was investigated but cleared of all wrongdoing.",1
"Kristen Bell has never released any wedding photos, until now.  The actress sat down with ""CBS Sunday Morning"" and gave viewers the first-ever glimpse into her 2013 wedding to actor, Dax Shepard.  ""We got married in a tiny room in the Beverly Hills courthouse, and it was still one of the best days of my life,"" she said.  Bell shared three photos from their wedding day. One shows them exchanging vows with Bell visibly emotional.  Another photo is of Bell and Shepard signing their marriage license.  A third photo shows the newlyweds sealing their ceremony with a kiss.  Shortly after their wedding, Shepard went on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" and revealed that they got a lot of bang for their buck by having a courthouse wedding.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle is reportedly 'frustrated' by the strict royal protocols that govern her new life since marrying Prince Harry .  Members of the public watching Meghan's transformation from Hollywood actress into the Duchess of Sussex could be forgiven for thinking she'd taken to her new role with ease.  She made an effortless joint engagement with the Queen to open a new bridge, attended the RAF centenary flypast, was a guest of the Irish President alongside Harry, joined sister-in-law Kate Middleton at Wimbledon and looked stunning at Prince Louis' christening.  But she is reportedly confused about aspects of royal life and the old-fashioned ways of the Windsor household.  A source told People.com how Meghan ""has found certain rules in the royal household difficult to understand, like the fact that the Queen prefers women in dresses or skirts rather than trouser suits, and is often asking Harry why things have to be done in a certain way"".  (Image: Getty)  (Image: PA)  The source added: ""I think she finds it a little frustrating at times, but this is her new life, and she has to deal with it.”  The monarchy website includes a reference to Meghan as a ""feminist"".  She had never previously shied away from voicing her opinions on issues that were close to her heart.  But protocol prohibits royal family members from expressing political opinions.  There was no greater example of this than an Irish politician's recent blunder which revealed Meghan's opinions on the country's recent referendum on legalising abortion .  (Image: WPA Pool)  Senator Catherine Noone posted on Facebook : ""A pleasure to meet Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador's Residence this evening.  ""The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result - she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result.""  The comments suggest that Meghan may have broken royal protocol by expressing political opinon.  Since the 17th century, members of the British monarchy have been banned from doing just that, which includes voting.  But from an early age, former Suits star Meghan was politically active.  Aged just 11 she successfully campaigned to have a washing detergent advert's sexist language changed.  She also said in 2016 she would move to Canada if ""misogynistic"" Donald Trump was elected US president.",0
"The hottest stars stepped out for the 2017 Latin GRAMMY Awards to celebrate the biggest night in Latin music at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Thursday night.  The three-hour show, hosted by Roselyn Sanchez and Jaime Camil, included sizzling performances by Luis Fonsi, Steve Aoki, Alessia Cara, J Balvin, Maluma and Person of the Year Alejandro Sanz, among others.  Juanes and Luis Fonsi were among the first winners of the night, with the ""Despactio"" singer taking home all four awards he was nominated for, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Shakira, who is currently on vocal rest and absent from the ceremony, won Best Contemporary Pop Vocal Album for her latest record, El Dorado.  ET caught up with Fonsi, who was nominated for four Latin GRAMMYs, before the ceremony, where he expressed how much the awards show means to him.  EXCLUSIVE: Luis Fonsi on His Influential 20-Year Career and His Mission to Help Rebuild Puerto Rico  “The Latin GRAMMYs to me are the most important music award for Latin music and to have four nominations is certainly an honor,” said Fonsi, who won his first Latin GRAMMY in 2009 for “Aqui Estoy Yo,” which was awarded Song of the Year.  ""To have Record of the Year and Song of the Year nominations are two huge categories, those two have a lot of weight,” he added. “But, you can’t control whether you win or lose and all the artists that are nominated are amazing, so I’m really just truly blessed to be among a great group of artists that I admire.""  Lin-Manuel Miranda was also honored with the President's Merit Award for his outstanding and numerous contributions to the Latin community, including his relief efforts for Puerto Rico following the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Upon taking the stage, the Hamilton creator thanked his team and his wife, Vanessa Nadal.  ""My people! Thank you, it's an honor to be here,"" Miranda began his Spanglish speech. ""No one gets here alone,"" he added before expressing how proud he was of the Latino community and dedicating the award to Puerto Rico.  ""I know I'm a weird theater kid here, with a weird accent,"" he continued. ""But let's keep collaborating and show the world that Latinos can change the world when we collaborate.""

"athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn’t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she’s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a “sideshow” for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn’t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she’s constantly finding ways to lose them with her inability to act decently in public and her outrageous attempts to place herself in the spotlight.She’s in the spotlight again, but it’s not the type of spotlight a celebrity should want to be in since this doesn’t seem to be a way to gain new fans.After her generic low-brow comments, some people might jokingly question if Kathy Griffin is a man. Nowadays, you just can’t tell anymore!How do you feel about Kathy Griffin’s remarks? Share your opinion and then post this on your Facebook page so other people can join the conversation.",1
"Jennifer Aniston.  Jennifer Aniston has been extremely fine and okay and great for some time now — she’s married to the artfully manscaped Justin Theroux, she’s working on a show with Reese Witherspoon, and her ex-husband Brad Pitt is in the process of divorcing Angelina Jolie, the woman he started seeing while he and Aniston were still married, a sad fact that must send a shiver of schadenfreude up Jen’s spine now and again. But Aniston doesn’t want to keep all this fine and okay and great energy to herself, she wants to share it with others who may tragically be less fine. How? As she told Amy Sedaris in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar:  My dream is to open a wellness center. I have a fantasy where you have this beautiful space with facialists, rotating workouts, meditation classes, and a café with recipes that are healthier versions of delicious foods so you’re not deprived. I’m working on it in my brain. Not to sound all woo-woo, but if you go out into the world with inner peace, you’re more joyful. There’s a life’s-too-short policy that I now have with my work; no negative Nancies.  All of that sounds (much like Aniston herself) okay and great, but the Aveeno spokesperson also shared some of the potential risks associated with attaining inner peace through facials:  I had a facial and woke up later with what looked like cystic teenage acne. It was an intense thing to look at Justin’s face. He was like, “What is happening?”  Alarming. But that probably wouldn’t happen at Jen’s wellness center of course, because she’s fine, it’s fine, everything’s extremely fine.",1
"Selena Gomez thinks Charlie Puth’s dating history disclosure was a mistake! A source close to Selena EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com her reaction!  Selena Gomez, 25, is seriously wishing Charlie Puth, 26, didn’t divulge their former relationship. A source close to Selena EXCLUSIVELY gave us the deets about how Selena reacted to Charlie’s confirmation that they dated. “Selena wishes Charlie would have kept his mouth shut about what they had because she is definitely interested in keeping that kind of stuff and her dating life as much under wraps as possible,” our source said. It’s clear that when it comes to who she dates, Selena apparently is all about maintaining her privacy.  According to our source, it’s only a matter of time before Selena responds to Charlie’s bombshell admission that they were briefly an item — and that Justin Bieber, 23, may have caused the two to go their separate ways. “Now, she will definitely have to respond down the line, and it’s just frustrating when people add their dirty laundry to a situation,” our source added. “She’s learned from the first time dating Justin and The Weeknd that less is more, which explains her relationship with Justin now being much more under the radar.” We reported earlier how Selena and Justin put to rest rumors that they had split by reuniting at one of his hockey games. While they arrived separately, the two of them definitely left together.  Time will tell if Charlie’s big reveal will throw a wedge into Jelena’s relationship, but all signs point to the two of them continuing to make it work in 2018.

"CLOSE Walmart is moving Cosmopolitan magazine from the checkout aisle after concerns were raised about the content. Elizabeth Keatinge (@elizkeatinge) has more. Buzz60  Cosmopolitan (Photo: Cosmopolitan)  Walmart is moving Cosmopolitan to a less uptown locale.  The retail giant will remove the women's fashion magazine from checkout lines at 5,000 stores across the country.  In a statement shared with USA TODAY, Walmart spokesperson Meggan Kring said: “As with all products in our store, we continue to evaluate our assortment and make changes. Walmart will continue to offer Cosmopolitan to customers that wish to purchase the magazine, but it will no longer be located in the checkout aisles. While this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard.”  The news was shared Tuesday via a press release from National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), an organization that says it helped instigate the policy change.  ""You can go through and buy your groceries with your family knowing you don't have to be exposed to this graphic and often degrading and offensive material,"" NCOSE Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Haley Halverson said in a Facebook live session Tuesday. ""Instead, all of these magazines will be moved, in isolation, to the magazine racks.""  A Cosmopolitan spokesperson told the Associated Press Wednesday that the magazine is ""proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world.""  Cosmo began running frank content about sex under the direction of editor Helen Gurley Brown in 1965. Brown transformed the once family-oriented magazine into a publication for single women that — along with topics on relationships, beauty, fashion and health — still publishes advice and discussions on sex.  The NCOSE, which changed its name from Morality in Media in 2015, has been working to cover or remove Cosmo from store shelves for years, deeming it porn. In 2015, the group was behind a successful push to place the magazine behind blinders in stores owned by Rite Aid and Delhaize America (which owns Hannaford Stores and Food Lion).  The organization has also been a strong Playboy opposer. Patrick Trueman, president of NCOSE, called Hugh Hefner ""a pioneer in the sexual objectification and use of women"" following his death in September, saying the Playboy founder left behind ""a legacy of sexual exploitation and public health harms.""  The Walton family, heirs to Walmart founder Sam Walton, have traditionally donated more to Republicans, and have had a conservative reputation, though the company dropped out of conservative advocacy group American Legislative Council in 2012.  Walmart's decision comes amid the Me Too movement and a national reckoning on sexual harassment, according to Halverson.  ""This is one less drop of hyper-sexualized media that is going to be bombarding people in their everyday lives, which does make a difference, especially in this Me Too culture that we're living in, where we really want a culture that will respect women and ensure their dignity is understood,"" Halverson said.  The Me Too movement, however, has focused on sexual harassment and assault rather than pornography. It gained momentum in October as bombshell reports from The New York Times and The New Yorkerdetailed decades of alleged sexual harassment and assault by producer Harvey Weinstein. Allegations against dozens of men in positions of power emerged in following weeks, and celebrities and non-celebrities alike flooded social media platforms with the hashtag #MeToo with their own stories of harassment, highlighting the depth of the problem.  USA TODAY's exclusive industry-wide survey revealed 94% of women say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment or assault over the course of their careers in the entertainment industry.  In a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday, Halverson says NCOSE hopes other major retailers follow Walmart's example.  ""We are not expressly calling for any boycotts, but we are asking Target and Walgreens to follow Walmart's example and also remove Cosmo from their checkout aisles,"" she wrote.  The Cosmo ban has caused debate on social media, with some praising Walmart's decision and others saying the company missed the point of the Me Too movement.

"No drivers, crew or other team members protested during the national anthem to start the NASCAR Cup series race after receiving warnings that they would be fired.  Several team owners and executives had said they wouldn't want anyone in their organizations to protest at The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing race in Loudon, New Hampshire, today.  Richard Childress, who was Dale Earnhardt's longtime team owner, told the Associated Press: 'It'll get you a ride on a Greyhound bus.'  Childress, 72, says he told his team that 'anybody that works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people gave their lives for it. This is America'.  No drivers or crew members were seen protesting during the singing of the 'Star-Spangled Banner, the United States national anthem, at Sunday's NASCAR Cup series race in Loudon, New Hampshire. Pictured is Martin Truex Jr, who won the event's first stage  Pictured at right is racer Brad Keselowski during the national anthem. Some NASCAR team owners have come out against the idea of protesting during the national anthem  Pictured is racer Jimmie Johnson during the national anthem. Some team owners even said they would fire any drivers who protested during the national anthem  Hall of Fame driver Richard Petty's sentiments took it a step further. The 80-year-old said: 'Anybody that don't stand up for the anthem oughta be out of the country. Period.  'What got 'em where they're at? The United States.'  When asked if a protester at Richard Petty Motorsports would be fired, he said, 'You're right.'  Pictured is Kyle Busch, who won the second stage of the race.

Unlike players in the NFL, no NASCAR drivers protested during the national anthem. At least 130 NFL players did protest at various games today  Another team owner Chip Ganassi, 59, says he supports Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin's comments.  Tomlin said before the Steelers played on Sunday that players would remain in the locker room and that 'we're not going to let divisive times or divisive individuals affect our agenda.'  NASCAR drivers have only been standing for the National Anthem for the past 20 years. Previously, they were strapped inside their cars, reports Yahoo Sports.  The comments come amid protests from other sports leagues, particularly the National Football League and the National Basketball Association against President Donald Trump and social justice issues such as police violence.  Several NFL players, starting last season with then-San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, have either knelt, sat or raised fists during the anthem to protest police treatment of African Americans and social injustice.  Last week at NFL games, four players sat or knelt during the anthem, and two raised fists while others stood by the protesters in support.  And on Sunday, at least 130 players knelled, sat with linked arms, gave black power salutes or did not show up for the national anthem out of protest.  Players from both the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars were the first to protest by taking a knee ahead of their game at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday morning.  No players were kneeling during the playing of God Save The Queen - the British national anthem.  Richard Childress, Dale Earnhardt's longtime team owner, said that a protest during the national anthem will 'get you a ride on a Greyhound bus.' The 72-year-old added: 'Anybody that works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people gave their lives for it. This is America.' He is pictured in May 2017  Hall of Fame driver Richard Petty, 80, said: Anybody that don't stand up for the anthem oughta be out of the country. Period. What got 'em where they're at? The United States.' He said he would fire any of his employees at Richard Petty Motorsports if they protested. Petty is pictured in June 2017  Chip Ganassi (right, pictured with Dario Franchitti in May 2012), said he supports Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin's comments. Tomlin said that 'we're not going to let divisive times or divisive individuals affect our agenda'  The protests came in the wake of Trump's critical remarks toward players who don't stand for the anthem.  'That's a total disrespect of everything that we stand for,' Trump said, encouraging owners to act. He added: 'Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, you'd say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He's fired.'  On Saturday, Trump echoed his stance.  'If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem,' Trump tweeted. 'If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!'  NASCAR has seen four black drivers in its nearly 70-year history and currently has one: Darrell 'Bubba' Wallace, 23, of Mobile, Alabama.  At the New Hampshire race, Martin Truex Jr of Furniture Row Racing won the first stage while Kyle Busch of Joe Gibbs Racing won the second.",0

"There's no doubt about it: Kelly Clarkson totally digs Gwen Stefani.  In her first season serving as a coach on The Voice, the ""Since U Been Gone"" singer has developed stronger friendships with Adam Levine, Alicia Keys and Blake Shelton.  At the same time, the Grammy winner has become closer with an idol she grew up listening to.  While chatting with E!

"We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman.

"No time to waste! Kylie Jenner isn’t going to let the first year of 4-month-old daughter Stormi pass her by without planning for the best 1st birthday bash Calabasas has ever seen.  The 20-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star revealed her plans for the celebration — or lack thereof — with followers in a series of Snapchat videos on Wednesday, June 27.  “Stormi is gonna be 5 months this weekend, which really is tripping me,” she began the first Snap. “That means we’re halfway to a year — almost — and I’m already thinking about her first birthday and how it’s going to be epic, OK?”  She continued to reveal that she had already decided on a theme, but sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian used it for their daughters’ joint birthday parties earlier in June. “I was going to do super magical unicorn theme, but North and Penelope beat me to it, so I have to think of something else.”  Jenner welcomed her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott on February 1. The lip-kit maven kept her pregnancy news under wraps until the birth announcement post on social media three days after the baby’s arrival.  “I understand you’re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. my pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world,” the reality star wrote at the time. “I knew for myself i needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way i knew how. there was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal i had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.”  The Life of Kylie star wasn’t shy about sharing sweet pics and videos of the baby girl until earlier this month, when she revealed that she’s not sharing photos of her little one “right now” after a followers accused her of cutting Stormi out of a selfie.  “Yeah I cut my baby out. I’m not sharing photos of my girl right now,” Jenner responded. She also went a step further and deleted all of the previously shared photos.

"Music's hottest couple is a couple no more. Blake Shelton left his girlfriend of two years Gwen Stefani high and dry when he dumped her before heading off on tour in February, In Touch has exclusively learned, and she's not taking it well. “Gwen doesn’t know what hit her,” said the insider. “She’s heartbroken.”  But wait, Gwen just posted a photo with Blake three days ago, so what gives? Apparently, it's a desperate attempt to ignore the truth. “She continues to send him loving social media support from LA while he’s been out on the road,” said another insider. “But Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.” He certainly hasn't reciprocated her online affection.  A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 1, 2018 at 3:52pm PST  “Blake’s through with Gwen’s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,"" explained the source. Apparently, Gwen was jealous over his closeness with The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski, and Blake got sick of trying to make her trust him. “She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""  “Blake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her,” said the source. “Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.” Watch the video below to look back at the couple in happier times.  Even worse, Blake has been looking for solace with newly-single ex-wife Miranda Lambert! “Miranda reached out to Blake via text,” said the insider. “Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships.

"The actor told friends he’s responsible for encouraging Brad to reignite his romance with former wife Jennifer Aniston, who George has always had a close friendship with.  Just last weekend, George and Brad were spotted out together for the first time in more than five years – marking a new chapter in their friendship.  The pair enjoyed dinner with other Hollywood heavyweights including Sean Penn, Bradley Cooper and Laura Dern in LA, with George even using Jen Aniston’s private bodyguard.  And it seems George didn’t hold back in telling dinner guests just how happy he is that Brad and Jen have reunited.  Brad, Jen and George have been friends for years Getty  ‘George has always hated Ange and really disliked the way she controlled Brad throughout their marriage,’ says a source.  ‘He loved Brad and Jen when they were together and was devastated when they split – especially when he found out it was because of Ange, who he’d never heard good things about.  ‘So when Ange and Brad split, George was the first person to call him and reconnect – and also plant the seed about reaching out to Jen.  ‘He’d stayed in contact with Jen even after her divorce from Brad – and they’ve never stopped being close.  When George heard that her marriage to Justin was on the rocks, he really stepped up efforts to reconcile the pair.  ‘Now it’s happened, he’s out there telling anyone who’ll listen that he’s responsible. He’s pretty chuffed about it.’  While Brad would’ve been more than happy to finally catch up with George and Sean – friends who he wasn’t allowed to hang out with while he was married to Ange – one notable no-show at the pre-Oscars weekend dinner was Jen.  Sources say she and Brad chose not to go to the restaurant together, to avoid any public scrutiny so soon after her official split from husband Justin Theroux – however it’s believed she caught up with Brad and George later.  ‘Jen lent George her bodyguard, knowing he and Brad would be coming back to her place in Bel Air after dinner,’ says a source.  ‘Given that George and Amal are mostly based in the UK now, he doesn’t have his own security detail in LA anymore – so Jen was only too happy to help.  ‘After the dinner, George and Brad went back to her place and they had a nightcap. Like old times.  ‘Brad raved about what a great mum Jen has been to his kids – that made him fall in love with her even more. And because George is a new dad he could really appreciate it.  ‘Brad said the kids have taken to Jen and they get really upset when they have to leave. He’s really enjoyed watching them bond.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",1
"Although the Kardashian-Jenners came together to celebrate model Kendall Jenner‘s birthday last week, her dad Caitlyn Jenner says they’re still not one big, happy family.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Caitlyn, 68, spoke to students at the U.K.’s Cambridge Union on Monday night, discussing her memoir, Secrets of My Life, which opened old wounds for the royals of reality TV surrounding her decision to transition from male to female in 2015.  “It’s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,” she told the crowd, according to the Cambridge News. “To be honest, I don’t talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven’t talked to in a year.”  Former stepdaughter Kim Kardashian West publicly supported Caitlyn’s journey but cut ties after reading her book, which alleged Kris Jenner — Caitlyn’s ex-wife and Kim’s mom — knew more about her gender identity crisis than she’s admitted.  “They don’t want me in their lives, the bashed me pretty badly. It’s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt,” Caitlyn continued. “I don’t know what the future holds. We will see.”  Still, the Olympic icon and Kris, 62, both attended daughter Kendall’s 22nd birthday bash at Petit Taqueria restaurant in Los Angeles, along with Kim, 37, and sister Kourtney Kardashian, 38. (Pregnant sisters Khloé Kardashian, 33, and Kylie Jenner, 20, skipped, continuing to keep low profiles.)  “Kris and Caitlyn only had a brief interaction to say hello, but everyone seemed fine,” a source told PEOPLE. “They were all focused on making it a special birthday for Kendall.”",0
"When Jennifer Aniston opens the door to the Malibu bungalow she’s been holed up in lately, she gives me a radiant smile and an effusive hello. Then she bursts into tears. We have scarcely sat down in the living room, a serene little haven simply furnished with cushy white sofas and white flowers and white candles, when her face crumples. She is instantly aghast. “I haven’t been feeling emotional lately, really I haven’t,” she wails, fluttering her hands like Rachel Green in distress, except that this time it isn’t funny. Other than the 24-hour security detail guarding her safety, Aniston is all alone in the modest rental where she has camped out while dealing with the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt—and its devastating aftermath, which has been far worse than the actual split. The last few months have brought an endless nightmare of hurtful headlines about her soon-to-be-ex-husband, along with blatantly fraudulent stories about herself, in the tabloids and supermarket gossip magazines. Pursued around the clock by the rabid paparazzi she refers to as “ratzies,” she is ambushed even on her own deck by photographers who lurk on the beach outside her door, spying on her every move. As she squeezes her eyes shut in an effort to stop crying, the scene provides a painful contrast with the last time we met. Little more than a year ago, I interviewed Pitt at the Beverly Hills mansion that he and Aniston had just spent two years renovating. A testament to both his passion for architecture and the couple’s hopeful vision of their shared future, the beautiful old house awaited only a baby in a bassinet to complete a picture-perfect existence. When I left, they both walked me out to my car. Their home, its windows lit and welcoming, glowed in the twilight. As we said our good-byes, Pitt and Aniston leaned together in the driveway, arms twined around each other. Her head rested trustingly on his buff chest, still pumped up from his rigorous training to play the warrior Achilles in Troy. They seemed the most fortunate couple imaginable—two beautiful superstars who had hit the jackpot, earning not only fame and riches but also an enduring love. Their fans had long been captivated by the romance of America’s Sweetheart and the Sexiest Man in the World, and now they were ready to begin a thrilling new chapter. Aniston’s 10-year run on Friends was ending, and she and Pitt had vowed to start a family when her stupendously successful television series was finished. Pitt’s final words to me reinforced the impression of connubial bliss: “I’m happier than I’ve ever been.” But the ensuing months brought an onslaught of rumors that he had gotten involved with Angelina Jolie while filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Instead of the joyful announcement many had anticipated from the Pitts, there was only silence. The New Year began with photographs of the beautiful couple strolling hand in hand along the beach on Anguilla, looking relaxed and happy. Immediately the buzz shifted into rhapsodic re-appraisals of the state of their union. And then came the oh-so-civilized announcement, on January 7, that Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt were separating—that their parting was “the result of much thoughtful consideration,” that it was not caused by “any of the speculation reported by the tabloid media,” and that they would remain “committed and caring friends with great love and admiration for one another.” If Pitt had kept a low profile in the months to come, that might even have turned out to be true. Instead, the ominous drumroll of gossip began to crescendo as he and Jolie rendezvoused in exotic locales, still denying that they were an item. With the paparazzi snapping away, Pitt stepped into what looked suspiciously like a paternal role with Jolie’s adopted Cambodian son, Maddox. “It was extremely hurtful to Jen that he was seen with another woman so quickly after they were separated,” says Andrea Bendewald, an actress who has been one of Aniston’s closest friends since they were teenagers. Instead of being reviled as The Other Woman, Jolie posed for pictures on an energetic round of appearances as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations—and then trumped even that public-relations bonanza by adopting another orphan, an African girl whose parents had died of AIDS. In the blink of an eye, the twice-divorced Jolie—previously known as a tattooed vixen with a taste for bisexuality, heroin, brotherly incest, mental institutions, and wearing her husbands’ blood—had morphed into a globe-trotting humanitarian who seemed to be channeling Audrey Hepburn. For the 36-year-old Aniston, who had expected to spend the past year being pregnant, the pain of watching this spectacle unfold was compounded by vicious rumors about herself. As misogynist as they were false, sensationalistic stories claimed the real reason the marriage ended was that Aniston refused to have Pitt’s baby because she was so ambitious she cared only about her career. Even now, that sexist slur makes her face darken. “A man divorcing would never be accused of choosing career over children,” she says. “That really pissed me off. I’ve never in my life said I didn’t want to have children. I did and I do and I will! The women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children; why would I want to limit myself? I’ve always wanted to have children, and I would never give up that experience for a career. I want to have it all.” Aniston’s intimates note acidly that Pitt could have done more to refute the mean-spirited rumor that his wife wouldn’t bear his child, which reinforced the impression that he had good cause to leave her for Earth Mother Jolie. To some, this looks like sheer hypocrisy. “When Brad and Jen were in the marriage, having a baby was not his priority—ever,” says one mutual friend. “It was an abstract desire for him, whereas for Jen it was much more immediate. So is there a part of Brad that’s diabolical? Did he think, I need to get out of this marriage, but I want to come out smelling like a rose, so I’m going to let Jen be cast as the ultra-feminist and I’m going to get cast as the poor husband who couldn’t get a baby and so had to move on?” As the image wars raged in the gossip media, a heartbroken Aniston retreated to her Malibu hideaway to lick her wounds in private, accompanied only by her elderly corgi-terrier mix, Norman, who spends most of his time snoring on his dog bed. Public sympathy seemed to be on her side; the Hollywood boutique Kitson reported that its “Team Aniston” T-shirts were outselling “Team Jolie” T-shirts by a margin of 25 to 1. But that was cold comfort as Aniston was assaulted by one provocation after another. When the Pitts split up, Brad insisted he hadn’t slept with Jolie, and Aniston accepted his denial. “She wasn’t naïve,” says Kristin Hahn, an executive at the Pitts’ production company, Plan B. “She’s not suggesting she didn’t know there was an enchantment, and a friendship. But Brad was saying, ‘This is not about another woman.’” The moment he and Aniston separated, however, he re-emerged in what looked like a full-blown affair with Jolie. Struggling to accept a separation she never wanted, Aniston found that the “facts” she had been told kept shifting like quicksand beneath her feet. When I ask about that gracious, no-one-is-to-blame announcement of their separation, she takes a deep breath. “What we said was true—” As I raise my eyebrows, she pauses for a moment, and then adds carefully, “—as far as I knew. We wrote it together, very consciously, and felt very good about it. We exited this relationship as beautifully as we entered it.” All Aniston wanted then was to figure out what happened; how did the happy life they’d planned drift so far off course? But everything changed on April 29, when photographs broke of Brad and Angelina frolicking on the beach with Maddox at a romantic resort in Africa. “The world was shocked, and I was shocked,” she says, still bending over backward not to excoriate her ex. But to say that this news was like pouring salt in the wound would understate its impact considerably; how about pouring molten lava into the hole where somebody ripped your heart out? And then things got worse.  The skies over Los Angeles are uncharacteristically gray today, and the Pacific shimmers with an opalescent sheen. Although the weather is gloomy, the ocean is calm; waves lap gently at the shoreline, making a soft shushing sound that Aniston has found very soothing lately. “That’s quite a backyard, in my opinion,” she says as we stand on her deck, watching the hypnotic rhythm of the waves. “Just being able to go to the water’s edge and scream—” Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. She grins. “Not too loudly. You don’t want people to think that you’re crazy. But it can be very cathartic.” She is wearing a white tank top and white drawstring linen pants, with a vivid lavender cashmere cardiwrap around her to ward off the unseasonable chill. Formidably toned by yoga, her body is in superb shape, but despite her tanned skin and megawatt smile she looks fragile and wan. She remains resolutely upbeat nonetheless, casting her current situation in the most positive light possible. “It’s beautiful here; I love it,” she says. “I’ve always wanted to have a little Malibu beach house, and it feels good. I’m enjoying simplifying things.” Although the bungalow was dark and depressing when she first saw it, a quickie makeover has transformed it into a cozy sanctuary that’s far more representative of Aniston’s personal taste than the showplace she and Pitt shared, where the décor seemed all hard edges and unforgiving materials. “Brad and I used to joke that every piece of furniture was either a museum piece or just uncomfortable,” Aniston says. “He definitely had his sense of style, and I definitely have my sense of style, and sometimes they clashed. I wasn’t so much into modern.” I mention Nicole Kidman’s quip after splitting up with Tom Cruise, when she was asked what she looked forward to in her new life without the diminutive husband who had abruptly ended their marriage. “Wearing high heels again,” Kidman retorted. So I ask Aniston—who filed for divorce on March 25 and expects it to become final this fall—what she’s enjoying about being on her own. “I can have a comfortable couch,” she says with a wry smile.  In the tabloids and celebrity gossip magazines, the soap-opera version of her life continues to hurtle along like a runaway express train, rushing Aniston through major life stages with ludicrous speed: Jen Is Devastated! Jen Is Furious! Jen Gets Revenge! Jen Has a New Man! Jen Is Over Brad! Most of the stories are wrong. (No, Oprah didn’t try to get Brad and Jen back together; no, Jen is not romantically involved with Vince Vaughn, her co-star in The Break-Up, a comedy about a separating couple who continue to live together, which they shot in Chicago over the summer.) Other reports are just idiotically simpleminded, breathlessly advancing a plot that bears little resemblance to the long, complex, painful experience of getting over a divorce. While the tabloids insist on dividing Aniston’s emotions into neat, distinct chapters, the reality is that pain and denial and anger and resignation all blur together, sometimes at the same moment—and the lengthy process of mourning is nowhere near over. “There are many stages of grief,” she says. “It’s sad, something coming to an end. It cracks you open, in a way—cracks you open to feeling. When you try to avoid the pain, it creates greater pain. I’m a human being, having a human experience in front of the world. I wish it weren’t in front of the world. I try really hard to rise above it.” Aniston is struggling to find a deeper meaning in the debacle. “I have to think there’s some reason I have called this into my life,” she says. “I have to believe that—otherwise it’s just cruel.” Her friends are filled with admiration for the way she’s handled the whole mess. “This woman is basically having a root canal without anesthesia, but she’s really trying not to numb the pain or shove it under the rug,” says Hahn. “She’s grown so much, and she continues to grow on a daily basis, because every time you think, ‘Well, I’ve dealt with this,’ there’s another hurdle to get over. It’s a bit Job-like at the moment.” Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue.  Aniston’s response has been to retreat into her cocoon, “in an effort to take care of myself and my heart,” she says. “I feel like I’m nesting. I love being home. I have friends that come over. My girlfriends I’ve had for 20 years. When things happen, the tribe gathers around and lifts you up. I’ve had lonely moments, sure, but I’m also enjoying being alone. There’s no question it takes getting used to; I’m a partnership person, and if something happens your instinct is to share it—but you’re no longer part of a couple. I definitely miss that. It’s sort of like Bambi—like you’re trying to learn how to walk. You’re a little awkward; you stumble a little bit. The things you would do with your partner, you don’t do. It’s uncharted territory, but I think it’s good for me to be a solo person right now. You’re forced to re-discover yourself and take it to another level. If you can find a way to see the glass half full, these are the moments when you learn the most. I’ve had to re-introduce myself to myself in a way that’s different.” She doesn’t downplay the difficulties. “Am I lonely? Yes. Am I upset? Yes. Am I confused? Yes. Do I have my days when I’ve thrown a little pity party for myself? Absolutely. But I’m also doing really well,” she says. “I’ve got an unbelievable support team, and I’m a tough cookie.… I believe in therapy; I think it’s an incredible tool in educating the self on the self. I feel very strong. I’m really proud of how I’ve conducted myself.” A crucial part of Aniston’s strategy has been to ignore the putrid stew of rumor, speculation, and outright falsehood in the tabloid media. “It’s been very important for me not to read anything, not to see anything,” she says. “It’s been my saving grace. That stuff is just toxic for me right now. I probably avoided a lot of suffering by not engaging in it, not reading, not watching.” She gestures toward Norman, who has roused himself for a moment to check on his mistress’s whereabouts. “It’s like those dog cones,” she says, encircling her neck as if putting on one of the plastic cones prescribed by vets to prevent dogs from scratching their ears. “I have my imaginary dog cone on, so I don’t see anything. It just allows for a much more peaceful life.”  Nevertheless, as Pitt publicly flaunted the instant family he had created with Jolie, the tableaux of their newfound togetherness were humiliating. “I would be a robot if I said I didn’t feel moments of anger, of hurt, of embarrassment,” Aniston acknowledges. But she tries to keep the lurid details to herself. “She is grieving, but she’s taken the high road,” says Bendewald. “She’s mourning the death of a marriage, and she’s done it very privately. She can have her moments of rage, but she doesn’t want to out him, and that keeps her heart clear. She’s not bad-mouthing him. She doesn’t want to make him the villain and her the victim.” Indeed, Aniston vehemently rejects the interpretation that she was left for another woman. “I don’t feel like a victim,” she says. “I’ve worked with this therapist for a long time, and her major focus is that you get one day of being a victim—and that’s it. Then we take responsibility for our own input. To live in a victim place is pointing a finger at someone else, as if you have no control. Relationships are two people; everyone is accountable. A lot goes into a relationship coming together, and a lot goes into a relationship falling apart. She’d say, ‘Even if it’s 98 percent the other person’s fault, it’s 2 percent yours, and that’s what we’re going to focus on.’ You can only clean up your side of the street.” These days, one index of recovery is the fact that Aniston’s sardonic humor is resurfacing. When I tell her that my 13-year-old son is a big fan of hers, she doesn’t miss a beat. “Is he single?” she asks, deadpan. She’ll toss off a crack about Pitt’s startling transformation into a punky bleached blond. “Billy Idol called—he wants his look back,” she murmurs with a sly smile. By now she can even talk about those gut-wrenching photos of Jolie and Pitt in Kenya with mordant resignation rather than tears. “I can’t say it was one of the highlights of my year,” she says. “Who would deal with that and say, ‘Isn’t that sweet! That looks like fun!’? But shit happens. You joke and say, ‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.’” She sighs. “I feel like I’ve earned a superpower shield,” she says. Then, afraid of sounding grandiose, she adds, “I’m not comparing my suffering to other people’s suffering. Everybody has their own.”  Aniston’s friends were particularly horrified by W magazine’s 60-page photo spread featuring Pitt and Jolie as an early-1960s-style married couple with a brood of miniature blond Brads. “You want to shake the shit out of him and say, ‘Your timing sucks!’” says one. “He’s made some choices that have been tremendously insensitive.” The W feature, which was entitled “Domestic Bliss,” couldn’t be blamed on the paparazzi; not only did Pitt conceptualize it, but he retained the international rights, so he actually profited from it. Aniston’s eyes widen in surprise when I mention that last fact, and she grimaces. “I didn’t know that,” she says. But she refuses to indulge herself in an angry reaction. “Is it odd timing? Yeah. But it’s not my life,” she says. “He makes his choices. He can do—whatever. We’re divorced, and you can see why.” She shakes her head in exasperation. “I can also imagine Brad having absolutely no clue why people would be appalled by it,” she adds. “Brad is not mean-spirited; he would never intentionally try to rub something in my face. In hindsight, I can see him going, ‘Oh—I can see that that was inconsiderate.’ But I know Brad. Brad would say, ‘That’s art!’” She rolls her eyes, pretending to screw something into her forehead. “There’s a sensitivity chip that’s missing,” she says. Aniston’s friends are amazed at her willingness to give Pitt the benefit of the doubt, but they basically agree with her assessment. “I don’t think he was trying to hurt Jen,” says Courteney Cox, Aniston’s dear friend and former co-star on Friends. “I don’t think that Brad is malicious, or a liar. The W thing was his idea, but I don’t think he thought that one through, about what it would look like to anyone else.” Although Aniston remains determined not to lash out, she sometimes questions her own restraint. “Why am I protecting him?” she exclaimed to one friend, only to continue with what she sees as the dignified course of action. “I’m not interested in taking public potshots,” she explains. “It’s not my concern anymore. What happened to him after the separation—it’s his life now. I’ve made a conscious effort not to add to the toxicity of this situation. I haven’t retaliated. I don’t want to be a part of it. I don’t have a halo that I’m polishing here; everyone has their personal thoughts. But I would much rather everyone move on. I am not defined by this relationship. I am not defined by the part they’re making me play in the triangle. It’s maddening to me. But I had a mom who was very angry about her divorce, and made shots, and I don’t want to play that out. If people are frustrated that I don’t want to do that, I’m sorry. I’m figuring this out as I go along. This is my first time at this particular picnic.”  As befits a storybook tale, the Pitts’ marriage was the first for both of them, and some of Aniston’s fondest memories are from the time they shared before the world discovered their romance. “We had so much fun falling in love,” she says wistfully. “It was so private; we kept it to ourselves for so long. It was something we were really proud of.” But after the relationship became public, it was always difficult to reconcile their mythic image with the quotidian reality of their private life, which was more likely to involve watching television, ordering takeout, and having close friends over than swanning around on red carpets. Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. “We were put on a pedestal, but we were just a couple like anybody else,” Aniston says. “When we were home, we’d watch the shows we loved, and one time there was this program called It’s Good to Be Brad and Jen. It was all about us going to Scotland and Greece and having our matching S.U.V.’s, and it wasn’t my life—I’d never even been to some of these places, but even I got sucked in. We’re sitting there saying, ‘Yeah, boy, it sure must be good to be Brad and Jen!’ So is it our responsibility to demystify this, to say, ‘This is not what it’s like—it’s not that fabulous, not that great’? There’s no doubt our life is fortunate, but … “ But even golden couples struggle with the formidable challenges of marriage. “It’s like the ebb and flow of every relationship,” Aniston says. “It’s hard; it gets easy; it gets fun again. What’s hard to sustain is some ideal that it’s perfect. That’s ridiculous. What’s fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person, and looking across the room and saying, ‘I’m still here. And I still love you.’ You re-meet, reconnect. You have marriages within marriages within marriages. That’s what I love about marriage. That’s what I want in marriage. It’s unfortunate, but we live in a very disposable society. Those moments where it looks like ‘Uh-oh, this isn’t working!’—those are the most important, transformative moments. Most couples draw up divorce papers when they’re missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection.” She sighs heavily and turns away to light a Merit cigarette. “That’s not Brad’s view of it,” she says, glum again. “We believe in different things, I guess. You can’t force a relationship, even if it’s your view of how you would like it to be conducted. Obviously two people leave a relationship because there’s a different thought pattern happening. My goal is to try and achieve a very deep, committed relationship. That’s what I’m interested in, but it’s someone’s prerogative to be or not to be in or out of a relationship.” “I think Jen wanted to work it out, and I don’t think he wanted to work it out,” Andrea Bendewald observes. “I don’t think he knew what he wanted.” Nevertheless, Aniston has only kind words about her marriage. “I still feel so lucky to have experienced it. I wouldn’t know what I know now if I hadn’t been married to Brad,” she says. “I love Brad; I really love him. I will love him for the rest of my life. He’s a fantastic man. I don’t regret any of it, and I’m not going to beat myself up about it. We spent seven very intense years together; we taught each other a lot—about healing, and about fun. We helped each other through a lot, and I really value that. It was a beautiful, complicated relationship. The sad thing, for me, is the way it’s been reduced to a Hollywood cliché—or maybe it’s just a human cliché. I have a lot of compassion for everyone going through this.”  As for what went wrong, Aniston rejects any simplistic explanation. “It’s just complicated,” she says. “Relationships are complicated, whether they’re friendships or business relationships or parent relationships. I don’t think anybody in a marriage gets to a point where they feel like ‘We’ve got it!’ You’re two people continually evolving, and there will be times when those changes clash. There are all these levels of growth—and when you stop growing together, that’s when the problems happen.” Friends say that it was always difficult for Aniston and Pitt to maintain the intimacy they craved while juggling their demanding work schedules, which often required long separations. Those tensions notwithstanding, Aniston believed her marriage was the real thing. “We both did,” she says. So what happened? “I think—it changed,” she says haltingly. “We both changed.” She sighs again. “You do the best you can, and I think we did. We did the best we could.” Both of them? She looks me straight in the eye. “Both parties,” she says. But nagging questions remain about Pitt’s conduct during the months leading up to their separation. “She was committed to the marriage,” says Bendewald. “He wanted to figure out who he was and what he wanted, but he seemed to want to do it without being married. She wanted him to figure out what he wanted and stay married. He didn’t think he could do that, so at that point she was like, ‘O.K., go figure it out.’” Throughout that period, Pitt insisted that his relationship with Jolie was not the cause of his marital discontent, but his actions since the separation have suggested otherwise. “I just don’t know what happened,” Aniston admits. “There’s a lot I don’t understand, a lot I don’t know, and probably never will know, really. So I choose to take away with me as much integrity and dignity and respect for what that relationship was as I can. I feel as if I’m trying to scrounge around and pick up the pieces in the midst of this media circus.” Does she buy Brad’s claim that he didn’t cheat on her before they separated? “I choose to believe my husband,” Aniston says. “At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised by anything, but I would much rather choose to believe him.”  Their friends are still trying to parse what happened with Jolie. “I don’t think he started an affair physically, but I think he was attracted to her,” says Courteney Cox, who vacationed with her husband, David Arquette, and the Pitts on Anguilla just before they announced their separation. “There was a connection, and he was honest about that with Jen. Most of the time, when people are attracted to other people, they don’t tell. At least he was honest about it. It was an attraction that he fought for a period of time.” He may have been fighting it, but Pitt virtually checked out of his marriage as soon as he began working with Jolie, according to Aniston’s intimates. “He was gone,” says one. Aniston has met Jolie only once, when she took a passing opportunity to say hello. “It was on the lot of Friends—I pulled over and introduced myself,” Aniston recalls. “I said, ‘Brad is so excited about working with you. I hope you guys have a really good time.’” But he soon became emotionally unavailable to his wife, at a time when she needed him desperately. Pitt’s withdrawal coincided with the end of Friends, which Aniston experienced as a huge loss. “That was really painful. It was a family, and I don’t do great with families splitting up,” says Aniston, who was deeply wounded by her parents’ bitter divorce, which happened when she was 9. “It was hard to have such a wonderful constant in your life, a place to go every day, and then all of a sudden it’s not there.” When she reached out for her husband’s support, she didn’t get it. “He just wasn’t there for me,” she says. To the amazement of Aniston’s friends, Pitt didn’t even show up for the final taping of Friends. “He was working,” she says, still defending him, even though movie stars have been known to request changes in a shooting schedule to accommodate events that are important to them.  Although she isn’t talking to Pitt these days, Aniston remains in regular contact with his mother, whom she loves dearly, and she doesn’t rule out a better relationship with Brad in the future. “I really do hope that someday we can be friends again,” she says. She certainly doesn’t regret her four-and-a-half-year marriage—not even the million-dollar wedding with 50,000 flowers, a 40-member gospel choir, a Greek bouzouki band, and fireworks exploding over the Pacific. (“It was fantastic!” she says.) But she does have other regrets. “There’s a lot I would probably do differently,” she says. “I’d take more vacations—getting away from work, enjoying each other in different environments. But there was always something preventing it; either he was working or I was.” She made more profound mistakes as well. “I wouldn’t give over so much of myself, which I did at times,” she admits. “It was that thing about being a nurturer; I love taking care of people, and I definitely put his needs before mine sometimes. It’s seamless; somewhere along the way, you sort of lose yourself. You just don’t know when it happens. It’s such an insidious thing, you don’t really see where it started—and where you ended. There’s no one to blame but yourself. I’ve always been that way in relationships, even with my mom. It’s not the healthiest. I feel like I’ve broken the pattern now. I’ll never let myself down like that again. I feel like my sense of self is being strengthened because of it.” Aniston’s unhappy family history colored her experience of marriage from the outset. “I come from a fighting family, and I had a tough time arguing,” she says. “Fighting scared me. I wouldn’t speak up for myself. That’s something I’ve learned; I will always speak my mind.” In recent months, the process of healing from the breakup with Brad has also created a new openness to healing relations with her mother. Their estrangement began nearly a decade ago, when Nancy Aniston gossiped about Jennifer on a television show, and worsened when she tried to cash in on Jennifer’s fame by writing an appalling book called From Mother and Daughter to Friends. Jennifer severed all contact, but she is now re-assessing their relationship. “We’ve exchanged messages,” she says. “Our doors are open. We’re taking baby steps. It’s a good thing.” Although Aniston incurred criticism for distancing herself from her mother, who did not attend her wedding, she offers no apologies. “I feel pretty good about the choices I’ve made. The choice of not speaking to Mom for a while—that’s ours. Nobody else has to understand it. The same thing with Brad and myself,” she says. “I wouldn’t change my childhood, I wouldn’t change my heartaches, I wouldn’t change my successes. I wouldn’t change any of it, because I really love who I am, and am continuing to become. “Besides, it’s all in the past,” she adds. “This doesn’t kill you. You move on. You can’t let the devastation of a divorce take over and win—let it make you this bitter, closed-off, angry, skeptical person. Then you’re just falling victim to it. You don’t want to shut your heart down. You don’t want to feel that when a marriage ends, your life is over. You can survive anything. Compared to what other people are surviving out there in the world, this is not so bad, in the grand scheme of things. Human endurance is unbelievable. Think of what mothers of soldiers have to rise above! Everything’s relative.” She looks down at her firm, fit body. “Nothing’s broke,” she says. Catching the quizzical look on my face, she concedes, “Maybe a little bruised.”  A few weeks later, on a stiflingly hot day in Chicago, Aniston and I are sitting in her hotel suite looking out on Lake Michigan, which is studded with little white boats. I’ve just told her about the gossip magazine that says she’s registered here as “Mrs. Smith.” The report claims Aniston is taking perverse pleasure in making hotel staffers address her as Mrs. Smith, even though they know perfectly well who she is. The only problem with this amusing tidbit is that it’s not true. “I wish I’d thought of it,” says Aniston, who is registered under an entirely different, although equally humorous, name. Despite her vow of abstinence, she succumbed to a celebrity magazine the other evening—and immediately regretted it. “I feel like I’ve fallen off the wagon,” she moans. Unfortunately, the first publication she picked up featured an insult from Kimberly Stewart, Rod’s party-girl daughter. “She said I’m homely,” Aniston says. “It literally ruined my night. I got my feelings very hurt, actually. That was my instant Karma.” She has always fretted about her appearance, although that is often hard for others to believe. Posing for her Vanity Fair cover shoot, Aniston was equally fetching in French-dance-hall-girl black stockings and in a half-open oversize shirt that evoked every man’s favorite just-rolled-out-of-bed look. With her tousled hair, cobalt-blue eyes, and dazzling smile, she seemed the ultimate adorable sexpot. Far from pining away in seclusion, she appeared to be sending a far more spirited message—like “Eat your heart out, Brad!” Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. But Aniston has never been able to reconcile the glamorous Jen on page or screen with the self-doubting woman she sees in the mirror, and the current tabloid coverage has exacerbated that gap. “It’s literally two different people—the real me, and the ‘Jen’ they write about, ‘fighting back,’ ‘getting revenge’—everything I couldn’t be farther from wanting to do,” she says. “So I’m back on the wagon.” When she arrived in Chicago to film The Break-Up, the gossip media, frantic for a new development, immediately plunged her into a torrid romance with her co-star, Vince Vaughn. This affair apparently does not exist. “I adore Vince Vaughn, but I’m not going out with Vince Vaughn,” she says. “I barely know the guy. We’ve exchanged a wine-and-cheese basket for the start of the movie, and we’ve gone out to dinner with the director and other people. We’ve got to get to know each other.” But is Aniston seeing him—or anyone else? “Nobody,” she says firmly. “I like a lot of people, but I am sooo not ‘in like’ with anybody. I am really enjoying being by myself. I’m excited that I know there’s somebody out there for me, but I am absolutely in no rush. This is all very fresh, very new. This was a seven-year relationship that was very dear, very complicated, very special. I need to honor it.”  Aside from her initial flurry of tears, Aniston remains calm and thoughtful through hours of conversation with me over the course of several weeks. But there is one final topic to be addressed, and it’s the most hurtful of all. The rumor that Jolie is pregnant with Pitt’s child has swept around the world; some reports even have her finishing her first trimester. When I ask Aniston about that, she looks as if I’ve stabbed her in the heart. Her eyes well up and spill over. Several long minutes go by as the tears keep rolling down her cheeks; she bites her lip, seemingly unable to speak. Finally she shakes her head; this subject is simply too excruciating to discuss. “My worst fear is that Jen will have to face them having a baby together soon, because that would be beyond beyond painful,” says Kristin Hahn.",1

"Meghan Markle misses her day job!  The Duchess of Sussex, who starred as Rachel Zane for seven seasons on USA's Suits, told an Irish well-wisher that she misses acting.  Fiona Moore, a fan, recalled her conversation with Meghan -- who was wearing a suit that was reminiscent of her fictional counterpart -- following the Duchess' walkabout with her husband, Prince Harry, in Dublin, Ireland, on Wednesday.  ""I'm a fan of Suits and I said to her that I miss it and she said, 'So do I',"" Moore told Hello!  Moore added of Meghan's disposition, ""She seemed very relaxed and was joking and laughing.""  Getty Images  When Meghan's character walked down the aisle to marry Mike Ross -- played by Patrick J. Adams, who also recently departed the show -- in the season finale, the fictional couple left a bit of a hole in the world of Suits. With Katherine Heigl joining the cast for its eighth season -- which premieres next week -- and Dulé Hill and Amanda Schull being bumped to series regulars, creator Aaron Korsch is hopeful about the show's future.  ""I’m going to miss Meghan and Patrick, but I think there are still interesting stories to tell,"" Korsch tells The New York Times in a piece published earlier this week. ""And then on the other side of it, you have a rejuvenation with new energy, on screen and off.”  On Thursday, the 36-year-old actress had a shot at earning an Emmy nomination for her last-ever acting role. Last month, a rep for USA confirmed to ET that Meghan was submitted for Emmy consideration in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category -- but ultimately didn't make the cut.  Meghan and Prince Harry, 33, have had a jammed pack itinerary the last couple of days. The newlyweds made stops at Trinity College, Croke Park and even met Michael Higgins, the president of Ireland, during their time in the country.

"The sun may be shining in Los Angeles, but there's still a cool breeze.  Jennifer Garner stayed warm and cozy on Tuesday by wearing a multi-colored and oversized scarf (reminiscent of Lenny Kravitz's infamous outerwear he wore in 2012) while out with her gal pals in L.A. on her birthday. The former Alias star, who turned 46 this week, outfitted the knitted scarf with sporty black leggings, a gray zip-up jacket, red-white-and-blue sneakers and tortoiseshell shades. Her brunette tresses were up in a long ponytail and she carried a water bottle, coffee cup and her phone in one hand.  BG004/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images  Garner later revealed on Instagram that that the massive scarf was a birthday gift from her daughter Seraphina.  ""When your nine year old weaves a 12ft long scarf on a peg loom for your birthday present, you’d better #werk #fashionfriday #thecarpoollineismyrunway #proudmom,"" she captioned another pic of her colorful fashion statement.  The actress appeared to have been in good spirits during her birthday, turning herself into a meme and taking to Instagram to thank everyone for their well wishes.  ""I’m having the best birthday and so much of it is because of all of you. Thank you for the birthday love! ❤️❤️❤️,"" she wrote alongside the silly pic of herself doing her hair.  Undoubtedly, 46 will be a good year for Garner as she makes her return to television with the series Camping, will kick-ass in the spy-thrillerPeppermint, and continues to treat fans to all her wonderful Instagram videos and pics.

"One February day in 2004, Maura Murray climbed into her car and drove away from her dorm room at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She headed north, her destination unknown. As night descended, a local in New Hampshire caught one last glimpse of Maura and her wrecked vehicle along a desolate stretch of Route 112.  By the time police responded to the crash, Maura was gone, seemingly vanished into thin air. Maura Murray’s disappearance shocked her family and friends. Nearly 14 years later, the cold case continues to baffle authorities, armchair detectives, and internet sleuths around the world. It has inspired everything from books and podcasts, to an increasingly bizarre web of conspiracy theories and true crime message board threads. Yet the mystery remains: What do we truly know about the disappearance of 21-year-old Maura Murray? Last weekend, Oxygen launched its own investigation into the Maura Murray case with a six-part series called The Disappearance of Maura Murray. Investigative journalist Maggie Freleng helms the search, enlisting the help of former U.S. Marshal Art Roderick as they trace the details of the baffling case. You can catch up on the first episode HERE. We plan to follow Oxygen’s investigation very closely. In the spirit of the pursuit, here’s what we know about Maura Murray’s life and her mysterious disappearance.  A Bright Life  Photo Credit: Oxygen  On the surface, Maura Murray’s life seemed ideal. She was a promising student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in pursuit of a nursing degree; she came from a loving family, and shared a strong relationship with her boyfriend of a few years. Yet all was not as it seemed. In November 2003, around three months before her disappearance, Maura was caught fraudulently using a credit card number that was not her own. The young woman had to have been desperate—she used the card only to order pizza, charging less than $80.  Want more disappearance cases?

Then, on February 7, 2004, two days before her disappearance, Maura’s father Fred arrived in Amherst, Massachusetts for a visit. Maura borrowed her father’s car to go to a party. Around 3:30 A.M., while driving back to Fred’s room at the Quality Inn, Maura hit a guardrail on Route 9. The police responded to the scene, but they didn’t perform a sobriety test. Maura may have believed that these encounters with the law would tarnish her professional record, thus threatening her dreams of becoming a nurse. Some sleuths point to this as a motive for Maura to disappear of her own volition. The theory seems extreme—Fred Murray does not buy it. Since there was no ticket cited at the scene of the crash, there would be no reason for Maura to believe this was the end of the line. Nevertheless, something changed in Maura after the crash that night.  Preparing for Departure  Photo Credit: Oxygen  In the early hours of February 9, Maura researched and printed out MapQuest directions to two different locations: one set that led to the Berkshires, the other to Burlington, Vermont. Throughout the day, she also phoned vacation rentals in the northeast, inquiring about availabilities. Nothing was booked. Then Maura’s messages took a dark turn. She wrote to her professors and work supervisors stating that she would be away from campus for a week. The reason? There was an unexpected death in the Murray family. No such death had occurred. At approximately 3:30 P.M., Maura Murray got in her car and left the UMass Amherst campus. Inside her vehicle were clothes, toiletries, some textbooks, and her birth control pills. Soon after her departure, Maura was recorded withdrawing $280 from a nearby ATM. She then entered a liquor store, where she purchased wine, coffee liqueur, and vodka. Security cameras captured Maura at the ATM, providing some of the last confirmed sightings of her before the disappearance. In the footage, she was alone. Whether Maura meant to temporarily escape the pressures of her life or disappear for good may never be clear. Upon leaving the liquor store, Maura drove north and then left Massachusetts.  Maura Disappears  Photo Credit: Oxygen  Sometime after 7:00 P.M., 145 miles north of Amherst in Haverhill, New Hampshire, a resident heard a heavy thump outside her home. She peered out her window to see a car crashed against a snow bank on Route 112. The witness phoned the police. Meanwhile, an area bus driver who lived down the road came upon the scene of the accident. He noticed a young woman—whom he later identified as Maura Murray. The bus driver offered to help. The young woman convinced him not to call the police, claiming she had already spoken to AAA. The man agreed to the woman’s request and left. Yet he found her claim about a phone call odd. He knew the area lacked cell phone service. Upon arriving home, he decided to phone the police. At 7:46 P.M. police arrived at the scene. The car was locked, its windshield cracked, and the airbags deployed. The police later reported that they found an empty soda bottle that smelled as though it had once been filled with alcohol. But Maura Murray was nowhere to be found. The bus driver who stopped and spoke with Maura didn’t think she seemed intoxicated. Nevertheless, many theorists believe that Maura had been drinking that night. A shaken and inebriated Maura may have left the scene of her own accord. She may have stumbled into the dark woods and lost her way. Or—as Maura’s father maintains—she may have encountered a dangerous individual, who wished to do her harm. The following day, at 12:21 P.M., police issued a BOLO (“Be On the Look Out”) for the young woman. Twenty-four hours after the discovery of the abandoned car, police officially declared Maura Murray missing.  Theories Emerge  Photo Credit: Oxygen  Maura’s family, especially Fred, view the police’s investigation as substandard. They point to their slow response and failure to thoroughly investigate every lead as the reason why Maura’s fate remains a mystery. The police, meanwhile, have criticized Fred’s involvement in the investigation. A 2014 article in Boston Magazine cites Jeff Strelzin, chief of the homicide unit at the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office and the lead prosecutor in the Murray investigation, who said, “Fred [Murray] has been a difficult person to deal with from the beginning.” Strelzin went on to describe Fred’s anger at the police as understandable but misplaced. As relations between Maura’s family and the police soured, rumors of infidelity and secret lives surfaced among armchair detectives and internet sleuths intent on cracking the case. James Renner, author of True Crime Addict: How I Lost Myself in the Mysterious Disappearance of Maura Murray, claimed to have evidence that Maura and her boyfriend were cheating on one another. Others believe that Maura may have been pregnant, bulimic, or both, and fled to escape judgment from her loved ones. Theories then split over whether she simply got lost and perished somewhere in the woods, purposefully disappeared to begin a new life, or if someone snatched her along Route 112. Despite legions of obsessives searching for the truth, there have been no definitive breaks in the case. That’s why we’re eager to dive back in to Oxygen’s The Disappearance of Maura Murray. Their search will examine the many unanswered questions that still haunt the investigation—and may change the case forever. The Disappearance of Maura Murray airs Saturdays at 7:00 P.M. EST/6:00 P.M.

"Tarek and Christina El Moussa are still filming the seventh season of Flip or Flop post-split, and the hit show won’t be their last together.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In fact, the friendly exes are diving into a new venture: producing.  Chi-Town Flip, which follows husband-and-wife team Bryan and Maira Segal as they transform homes in the Windy City follows the same model as Tarek and Christina’s successful series, and will be the first launched by the production company the El Moussas formed last year, before they separated.  “We’ve been working together for a really long time, It’s our job. Obviously, we know each other really well,” says Tarek of the former couple’s dynamic as business partners. They’re co-executive producing the series, which he notes they began working on “before separation. So it’s been a long, long process.”  But they’re not simply seeing the project through before parting ways. Tarek tells PEOPLE exclusively, he’s not ruling out the possibility of working together again down the line. “It’s hard to say right now because we’re just letting the dust settle. But I’m always looking for growth, always looking into tomorrow,” he says. “The future is bright. We’ll see what happens,”  WATCH THIS: Christina and Tarek El Moussa’s Divorce Has Not Stopped Their Business Relationship  Christina and Tarek discovered their proteges at one of their real estate seminars, where Bryan, a former police officer, made sure to leave a lasting impression on the HGTV stars. “While we were doing pictures with all the students,” Tarek explains, “he comes up to me and shakes my hand and says, ‘You’re gonna know me.’ And I’m like, ‘Okay, nice to meet you,’ and he goes, ‘No,’ and he wouldn’t let go of my hand, ‘You are going to know me.’ I thought he was funny. Ten minutes later he comes back. He went back in line again to tell me, ‘You are gonna know me.'”  And he was right. The two connected after the seminar and became fast friends. “I definitely mentored Bryan quite a bit,” Tarek notes. “And it’s really worked out. He’s created a really successful business with his wife.” Bryan and Maira take on similar roles to Christina and Tarek, with the guys focussing on construction and the women designing to sell.  In the premiere alone, they face possible bullet holes in the windows, unsightly facades, and 100 years worth of potential damage — and that’s all before they step inside.  Check out the trailer above and watch the premiere of Chi-Town Flip August 6 at 2PM on HGTV.",0

"It’s Tom Cruise’s big butt and he cannot lie. In August, an eagle-eyed Valkyrie viewer, amazed by the thickness on display, suggested that the actor was using some sort of movie magic. Was it a butt double? Or a prosthetic? VFX? A cushion? Screen Rant asked Cruise to clear up the bun debate, which he apparently had no idea about. “There was no prosthetic in Valkyrie. No,” he confirmed. Cruise thought the question was funny, and further clarified that he does his own booty work in Doug Liman’s American Made, in which he playfully moons his onscreen wife Sarah Wright. “It’s me,” Cruise told Screen Rant. “It’s not CGI, it’s me. I do my own mooning in films. So let it be known — I do my own mooning.”  hello, please, i present the theory that for one single shot in Valkyrie (2008), at 5:12, tom cruise wears a fake butt. observe: pic.twitter.com/Tw6yTbsQUe — swizz keats (@iluvbutts247) August 20, 2017",1
"The reality of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's break becoming a permanent breakup may be sinking in for the Biebs, or so People's new report suggests. A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him—at church, the ice rink, and beyond. “He loves her. He wants her back,” the source said, adding that Bieber “misses” Gomez.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Bieber and Gomez's last big public date was his father's wedding in Jamaica, where they recreated their 2011 wedding kiss. They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids.  But Gomez's family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly's source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. “[He] doesn’t care about anyone but himself,"" the source told Us on March 12. ""The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn’t need him.”  The break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber's March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: ""Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,"" a source told E! on March 21. ""It wasn't his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.""  Meanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. ""Selena realized even though he's made some positive improvements, they just aren't a perfect match right now,"" a source told the outlet.  But Gomez's birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.  Gomez was most recently photographed with her friends yesterday, posing in pink pajamas and Puma merch. She was also filmed lipsyncing in the car by her assistant Theresa Mingus:  Instagram  Bieber attended Holy Wednesday church service with Baskin Champion but has not been photographed with her since. His last appearance was on his social media on Easter, when he posted four bunny selfies.",1

"If, on Wednesday morning, you had risen early enough and rejoined the torrid, infinite march that is Twitter, you might have first learned of NBC’s termination of its morning-news lodestar, Matt Lauer, through neutral channels. At 6:52 A.M., the Times’s media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, tweeted, “BREAK: NBC Matt Lauer fired, inappropriate workplace behavior . . . story to come.” But, at 7 A.M., the “Today in New York” warmup ended, the friendly corporate bells chimed, and the “Today” show, as it has since 1952, started. The minutes in between were a chasm.  Stills of Lauer—bespectacled and reviewing notes in one, professorially inquisitive in another—crossed the screen as the voice of his co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie, announced the breaking news that Lauer’s employment had been terminated overnight, after an employee had come forward on Monday “reporting behavior in violation of our company’s standards.” Guthrie’s voice trembled as the camera captured the tableau—Guthrie and her guest co-anchor, Hoda Kotb, palpably sombre, the Popsicle-orange “Today” show logo floating between them. Guthrie clasped Kotb’s hand. She read the entirety of a statement from the NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack, which was composed in the corporate “we”: “we” had reason to believe that the employee’s complaint wasn’t an isolated incident; “we were deeply saddened by this turn of events”; “we will face it together as a news organization—and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.” Then Guthrie and Kotb offered their personal expressions of shock and dismay. Lauer had been loved by so many; “we” loved him. “As I’m sure you can imagine, we are devastated,” Guthrie said. “We’re trying to process it and make sense of it, and it’ll take some time for that,” Kotb said. Expressions of disorientation not dissimilar from expressions of mourning continued for the rest of the show. As Rebecca Traister wrote earlier this month, a “powerful white man losing a job is a death.”  We have witnessed a theatre of accountability insidiously refine itself, quite quickly, in the past few months. Louis C.K.’s statement, for example, following the exposé in the Times of his sexual harassment of female comics, was not as passionate as, but was more coherent than, Harvey Weinstein’s ramblings about Jay-Z and the gun lobby. The opportunistic finesse of Kevin Spacey’s coming-out certainly tripped some social alarms, but he nonetheless garnered some sympathy. Power brokers like the Pixar animation baron John Lasseter have even scooped long-labored-over articles by preëmpting them altogether. (Lasseter is taking a six-month leave of absence.) No display was savvier than NBC’s orchestration on Wednesday.  The “Today” show’s artful transposition of grief where there would naturally be scrutiny continued into the 10 A.M. slot, in which the veteran host Kathie Lee Gifford spoke of how much she, too, loved Lauer and how sad she was. It continued on this morning’s program, with Guthrie and Kotb again at the helm. Not since Bill Cosby—or Bill O’Reilly, depending on one’s television diet—has the scourge of sexual assault so acutely infiltrated the righteous perimeter of the American home. (President Trump, also affiliated with NBC and accused of assaulting women, never quite depended on a family-man image.) The influence of a behind-the-scenes figure like Weinstein can feel diffuse, removed from our everyday cultural consumption; Lauer was, and is, synonymous with the family feel of “Today.” Part of this comes from the network’s bloated investment in Lauer—he reportedly earns between twenty million and twenty-five million dollars a year. (In 2014, a source told Page Six that the company chartered helicopter rides for Lauer from his Hamptons compound to its Rockefeller Center studios at his request.) When, in 1996, Lauer wrested the anchor chair from Bryant Gumbel, gossip magazines swooned over his geometric jaw and feathery hair; twenty years later, he was transforming comfortably into a smug but wise paternal figure. His tenure at the “Today” show was the longest in its history. Now instances of Lauer’s public pettiness toward women seem like the exertions of a holistically awful campaign. In 2012, he admonished the actress Anne Hathaway for photographs that the paparazzi had taken of her exiting a car. “Seen a lot of you lately,” he said. And, famously, Lauer was an architect of “Operation Bambi,” a plan that succeeded in getting his former co-anchor Ann Curry fired from the show that same year. (“ ‘Chemistry,’ in television history, generally means the man does not want to work with the woman,” Curry said, according to Brian Stelter’s insider anatomy, “Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.”) On her final show, Curry wept and Lauer pretended to soothe her. His interview of Hillary Clinton last year was intrusive and aggressive when compared with his handling of Trump. How a man thinks of women dictates how he works with them.  The stakes with Lauer, as with Charlie Rose, who was fired from both CBS and PBS last week, for sexual harassment, threaten the geniality and social integrity that are the trade of the morning-show apparatus. And so it is no surprise that, to convey something like moral mooring to a vastly female audience, the networks rely on women anchors to break the public fall. An ether of remorse already fogs the perception of Lauer’s ousting, though Lauer waited a day to issue a statement and in it said, “Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.” It seems likely that, at least when it comes to the fact of Lauer’s firing, Guthrie had truly been caught off guard. The company, however, wasn’t; reporters at Variety and the Times had spent months investigating claims against Lauer. Guthrie’s vulnerable pose conferred an unearned armament to a company that had employed a reckless man for two decades. The woman anchor’s surprise becomes the network’s surprise; her sorrow, its sorrow. “How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they behaved badly?” Guthrie asked, her eyes glassy. For her, and for Gayle King, who asked a similar question when reporting on her co-host Rose’s transgressions last week, on CBS, the question of loyalty may be relevant. (It was Lauer who lobbied for Guthrie’s co-anchorship, in 2012, following the success of “Operation Bambi.”) But neither love nor loyalty nor sadness excuses NBC, the company that passed on its own employee’s reportage of Weinstein’s abuse of women. The Variety report on Lauer, published on Wednesday afternoon, included accounts of harassment from three unnamed women. It showed an emboldened player whose harmful wiles were accommodated by the network around him. The news mediates the news.  One detail from Ramin Setoodeh and Elizabeth Wagmeister’s reporting in Variety mentions a contraption, apparently common in the offices of executives of his stature, that in this context sounds like something used by a villain from a Bond film. The installation of a button under Lauer’s desk made it possible for him to lock himself, and anyone else who might have been invited into his office, inside, without getting up from his seat. The Times reported that NBC on Wednesday had received at least two more complaints from employees about Lauer’s behavior. One woman told the Times that Lauer locked her in his office in 2001: “She said the anchor then stepped out from behind his desk, pulled down her pants, bent her over a chair and had intercourse with her.” She passed out and was taken to a nurse by Lauer’s assistant. Reading the article, I wondered who had seen that commotion, and I thought about the lock, an instrument of security turned into an instrument of violence.",0
"Hugh Jackman was a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight, and Colbert had an important question for the Logan actor: now that he’s done playing Wolverine, will we finally get to see “fat Jackman?”  Jackman has been playing Wolverine since 1999, and it’s been seventeen years that he’s had to stay in peak physical condition so that he could perform shirtless scenes for the movies. Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.  One of us! One of us! One of us!  Logan is in theaters now.  (Last Updated )",0
"(JTA) — Most artists would see playing one concert at New York’s Madison Square Garden as a crowning achievement. Billy Joel has now done it 100 times.  Before and after his landmark show last week at the “World’s Most Famous Arena,” the native Long Islander gave a series of interviews about his legacy. In one with CBS News, he was asked about the most memorable moments during his incredible — and likely all-time record-breaking — MSG run.  After mentioning the nights that involved his daughter Della onstage, Joel brought up the concert during which he wore a yellow Star of David. Joel pinned the star to his jacket during the encore of a Garden show last August, shortly after white supremacists and neo-Nazis led a deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia.  “This past year or so, there was the night I wore the Star of David, after the Charlottesville incident,” he said.  Although Joel is usually described as atheist or secular, his father was a German-born Jew who recalled the rise of Hitler and lost relatives in the Holocaust. CBS interviewer Anthony Mason pointed out that Joel usually avoids taking political stands.  On the weekend of the rally, President Donald Trump said “both sides” were to blame for the violence that occurred — and that were some “very fine people” among the far-right marchers as well as their opponents. That struck a dark chord with the songwriter.  “I had to do something that night,” Joel responded. “The president said [after the Charlottesville rally], you know, ‘There’s some good people on that side …’ No, Nazis aren’t good people.  “It really enraged me, actually,” he continued. “My old man, his family got wiped out. They were slaughtered in Auschwitz. Him and his parents were able to get out. But then he was in the U.S. Army during the war and fought with Patton and was shot at by Nazis. … My family suffered. And I think I actually have a right to do that.”  While many found the act courageous, it prompted some criticism.  But the singer also started a trend. Soon after, TV star Nev Schulman and musician and producer Jack Antonoff (both outwardly Jewish) both wore Jewish stars at the MTV Video Music Awards — Schulman wore one pinned to his suit jacket, and Antonoff wore one in necklace form. Lena Dunham, Antonoff’s girlfriend at the time, said he ordered the necklace after feeling like Nazis had become a “mainstream thing again.”  RELATED:  Billy Joel wore a yellow Jewish star. Thanks, but the trend should stop there.",0
"Shannon Beador has been 'blindsided' by her estranged husband David's new relationship.  David has gone public on Instagram with new girlfriend Lesley, who he reportedly started dating in December, just two months after Shannon announced their separation after 17 years of marriage.

He also added emojis of a plane, a tropical island, a sun and two glasses of wine.  The pretty blonde had captioned the photo with a simple heart emoji but replied to David in the comments, writing: '@david_beador Happy Valentine’s Day to the most kind, funny, motivated, loving & man!

'He’s always been selfish and is clearly not thinking about how this will affect his children.'  It first emerged last month that David was no longer hiding his new love as he referred to himself as 'the lucky one' in the comments of Instagram photo Lesley shared of the two of them.  'David wasted no time and has already started dating again and has moved on entirely,' an insider told E! News at the time.  'It’s disgusting and cruel that David would be putting this out so publicly as their divorce is not yet finalized' a source told People  Falling apart: Shannon, 53, shared this inspirational quote to Instagram last week  'He’s been seeing this woman for at least a few weeks now and the word has spread around Newport Beach.'  Shannon meanwhile returned to filming Season 13 of the Real Housewives on February 9.  Last week the mother-of-three shared an inspirational quote to Instagram which read: 'Sometimes when things are falling apart they may actually be falling into place.'  According to Page Six Shannon is requesting spousal support and attorneys' fees to be paid by David.  The star is also asking for sole physical custody of their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody.  Shannon has requested David be granted child visitation.  She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.  The Bravo star filed documents in Orange County Superior Court in December after announcing her separation in October.  She and David will be in divorce court on March 12.  The split came two years after the couple worked to repair their relationship after David admitted to having an affair.  Single: The split came two years after Shannon and David worked to repair their relationship after David admitted to having an affair  The crumbling of their marriage was documented on Real Housewives with David admitting that he'd been unfaithful to her during season 10; on season 11 they renewed their vows. But still there were problems.  During the season 12 reunion show of RHOC she broke down in tears when she said it was David, not her, who wanted the marriage to end.  'It’s not what I wanted and it’s been really, really hard,' she said.  'We went on a trip to Hawaii, which I kind of hoped would bring everything together, but he left the trip early. And when I came home, he said, ""We’re done,""' she told the reunion host Andy Cohen.  The star is asking for sole physical custody of her their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody  'I said to David, when he told me it was over, ""What happened? We had a couple of amazing years."" And he goes, ""We had a couple good months."" It was just a knife in the heart.'  Shannon also revealed David became distant from her when she gained 40lbs.  She has been very frank with her fans about her struggle to lose weight and how the stress from her bad marriage made her eat more.  She told People last year: 'It’s heartbreaking for me and my daughters that this is the road that had to be taken but it’s the only way.  'I felt alone in my marriage.

News that it was one of the hardest readings he has done yet.  ""That was really probably one of the toughest ones of the entire season because Teresa's reading, her grief was still very tangible. It was really clear in her face,” he told E! News exclusively.  ""She was still very much grieving her mother. And I think the reading came at an important time. I think it was necessary for her to have that experience. I think it's one of those ones where it will take time for her to really process the magnitude. Not only the experience but also of her grief. It was just a really vulnerable, emotional side of Teresa that I think people will see and be able to relate to. And I really appreciate that she put her grief so openly out there to the world because people will relate to it and also be able to heal from it who are in similar situations, just through that reliability. So that was really special.”  The good thing about the reading was that it brought Teresa some much needed closure, according to Tyler. ""I think obviously the inherent nature of this is comforting in knowing that our loved ones are around. I think for her it was also just about talking through the physical loss and I think she was still very much focused on that physical loss, and that's a very normal state to be in especially when a passing is so recent.”  He also added that Antonia made no mention of Teresa’s past legal troubles nor her husband Joe's future behind bars.  ""When she came through, her mother was really very much just focused on the present moment,"" he said. ""And obviously her death came at a very difficult time when the family was going through a lot and anticipating a lot so I think she was just very much focused on kind of picking up those pieces and regrouping. There were messages that focused towards the future obviously for Teresa. I don't know what will be shown, what won't, but it was all very positive. There was nothing that came through that was any way negative and it was just very much focused on telling her what to focus on and what's worth your energy, what's not. Just help to provide that clarity for her so that was good.”",1
"From Miley Cyrus' secret marriage to her pregnancy, there have been a lot of rumours in the air lately about the Malibu hitmaker's personal life.  Recently her Thanksgiving tweet sparked speculation about the songstress being pregnant which apparently drove her so crazy that she took to Twitter to retweet the picture and addressed all the rumours.  Also read: Miley Cyrus pregnant? Malibu singer has a hilarious response to the baby bump rumours  She wrote: ""RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a s— ton of tufurkey.""  Even after that, Hollywood Life reported that the Wrecking Ball singer wanted to get 'pregnant ASAP' with fiance Liam Hemsworth.  An insider reportedly told the website, ""Miley's totally ready to start a family with Liam.""  Although she did not appreciate the speculations that she was pregnant ""because it is something she has thought about for a while that hasn't happened yet.""  RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a shit ton of tufurkey pic.twitter.com/rjNjquxvLb — Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) November 23, 2017  The source reiterated: ""She wants to be married, she wants to start a family but Liam isn't 100% ready for all of that just yet. She can only hint about it so much.""  Hence those kinds of baby bump rumours have driven her crazy ""because she would want nothing more than for those rumours to be true.""  ""Miley is just waiting for Liam to be just as ready as she has become. She knows that it is all in time but if it was up to her, she would love to speed up the process,"" the source also told Hollywood LIfe.  But as usual, Gossip Cop exposed the truth behind all these speculations and claimed that the insider's statement is entirely fabricated.  Given that, the Hollywood Life's report looks contrary to its own insider's statements. While Miley herself rubbished all the pregnancy rumours on Twitter during Thanksgiving, how is it possible that she told the insider about her willingness to get pregnant?  Besides this, the songstress clarified in a radio interview a few months back that she is in no rush to have kids. Talking to 104.3 Myfm, Cyrus said, ""No, I love pigs more than kids, to be honest.""  Thus it is quite clear that the story about Cyrus wanting to ""get pregnant ASAP"" and ""have babies with Hemsworth"" is entirely made up.",1

"It's not a good time to Jennifer Aniston. After her marriage with Justin Theroux ended, she has been constantly in the limelight being scrutinized for her reactions on how her ex is moving on after the split. A while ago it was Selena Gomez and now it is another actress who has been drawn into the picture. The Friends actress is fed up with hearing news of Emma Stone and Justin's budding romance.  The actress is reportedly furious seeing how things are unfolding for Emma and Justin. According to Radar Online, Jennifer is filled with 'furious rage' looking at both of them get close and taking various trips together. “It bugs the hell out of Jen that Justin got close to Emma during their marriage and she isn’t taking this lying down,” a source told the website.  Jennifer is not taking news about Emma and Justin well (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)  It seems like Jennifer is taking every bit of help she can from her pals in order to get back at Emma. “She’s dragging Emma every chance she gets and warning pals like Jason Bateman and Jimmy Kimmel to avoid her,"" the source added. The website further added that Jennifer is ""fuming"" over their now public romance. “Jen and her squad take issue with the fact that Emma never met a role she couldn’t steal from another actress [most famously ‘La La Land’ from Emma Watson],” the source revealed.  “I don’t think she realizes who she messed with and how far Jen’s reach is,"" the source added. The website claims that the rage Jennifer has towards Emma is a lot like she had over Angelina Jolie after Brad Pitt broke up with her to be with the Maleficent actress. “This is a pattern for Jen, never directing the rage or gossip at the guy who left her but instead at the next woman he hooks up with,"" the source revealed.

The rumors about Emma and Justin dating emerged after the two were spotted dining together in NYC. The pair was all smiles as they were photographed heading into Blue Ribbon Sushi in Soho for a night out.  At the same time, nearly a month after Justin announced his split from Jennifer Aniston, he made his first public appearance at the Louis Vuitton fashion show during Paris Fashion Week on March 6. The actor was seen sitting next to Michelle Williams and Emma. The following month, Justin shared some pictures on his Instagram where it was seen that the actor was hanging out with the Queer Eye's Jonathan Van Ness and Emma. Knowing how one photo is enough to raise speculation, Justin was careful of the words he used and made sure that he made their relationship status clear in the caption.  ""Save lives! Save lives! Saving lives! Doing the most! Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs,"" he wrote. The pair was also spotted leaving Met Gala together even though they arrived separately at the event. Emma looked flawless as she wore a navy dress with gold embellishments for the event, while Justin chose to keep his look a bit casual as he opted for an all-black ensemble. The pair has been good friends ever since they worked together for Netflix's show 'Maniac'.",1

"Nearly two years after Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, the former power couple have reached a new temporary custody agreement over their six children for this summer, Us Weekly confirms.  According to court documents obtained by Us, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County determined that “not having a relationship with their father” would be “harmful” to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9. The court said that the kids “are safe with their father” and that it is “critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship” with both of their parents. However, Maddox is essentially free to go with either parent because of his age.  Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, were ordered to arrange a phone call between them, their children and two psychologists “to explain the summer schedule,” the documents state. The Fight Club actor will have physical custody of the minor children (all but Maddox) for four hours a day from June 8 to 17 in London, where the Maleficent actress rents a house. Pitt must spend time with each child at least twice during the 10-day period with one of the psychologists present. Jolie will not be present during her estranged husband’s custodial time.  The Moneyball actor will have custody of the minor children for 10 hours each day from June 27 to July 1 with the other psychologist present. He also has custody for four hours a day from July 8 to 14. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Pitt will have custody of the kids from July 21 to 29. He is responsible for returning them back to Jolie in London on July 29, in addition to paying for their transportation. He will have custody again from August 11 until the estranged couple’s next court hearing on August 13.  In addition, the Tomb Raider actress must provide Pitt with “each of the minor children’s personal cellphone numbers so that [he] may text them,” according to the documents obtained by Us. She cannot monitor the texts.  Jolie and Pitt separated in September 2016. In light of the latest arrangement, a source tells Us, “This [divorce] has been a longstanding back-and-forth, and hopefully now there will be greater collaboration for the benefit of the kids. The kids have always been a priority for both parents and hopefully everyone will comply with the court order going forward. Brad will be wherever he needs to be for the kids.”  A spokesperson for Jolie responded to the release of the custody agreement in a statement to Us on Wednesday, June 13: “This misleading leak is not in the best interests of the children. From the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately. It’s deplorable that someone, for their own selfish reasons, leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",0

"Just when it seemed things couldn’t get any worse.…They did. Capping of a tumultuous week of bizarre rants and a Trump-related Twitter firestorm, Kanye West showed up in the TMZ newsroom on May 1 and dropped a few new bombshells. During a rambling 42-minute interview, the erratic rapper announced that he’d been hooked on opioids after liposuction in 2016 and declared that ""when you hear about slavery for 400 years…that sounds like a choice."" His shocking comments were met with instant backlash from fans, fellow celebrities and especially his own wife, Kim Kardashian.  ""She’s just so mad at him for embarrassing her — and her family — over and over and over again,"" says a Kardashian source, noting that Kim is fearful about how Kanye’s behavior affects everything from their children to the Kardashians’ public image and business empire. The pair fought bitterly, adds an insider, because ""Kanye was furious that she would even try to silence him. He stormed off, leaving Kim in tears."" Now with Kanye, 40, holed up at a Wyoming resort — purportedly to work on his music — Kim, 37, is facing the fact that her third marriage is in free fall. ""She’s more humiliated than ever,"" says the source. ""Her sisters and mom, Kris Jenner, are asking her how much more of this she can take.""  She’s put up with so much already. ""Kim has tried to talk to Kanye about the effect his words are having, not only on his friends and his fans, but on those closest to him,"" says the insider, noting that she’s been living in fear for the family — including kids North, Saint, and Chicago — after rapper Daz Dillinger urged the notorious Crips gang to “f--- Kanye up.”  While Kanye brushed of the danger during his TMZ rant, he and Kim did appear to beef up security, says the insider: ""They’re taking this very seriously."" All of the Kardashians are on red alert. ""This is most definitely a family crisis,"" says the insider. ""Everyone has been in heated conversations, trying to figure out how the hell to shut Kanye up."" And how to keep the family businesses running smoothly.  ""Kim hopes people won’t hold Kanye’s actions against her,"" says the source, ""but Kris has been on the phone tirelessly with the execs they work with to make sure that there are no problems."" Kim is already breathing a little easier now that Kanye’s out of town. ""It’s way less stressful,"" says the source, noting that they hardly speak when he’s working. ""She wants to unwind and not make any rash decisions. But just having him out of LA has already been great for her mental state. And she’s doing whatever she can to be vocal about how Kanye’s opinions are NOT hers.""  But Kim knows his actions reflect on her — and she’s got a big decision to make about their future. As embarrassing as it will be for the reality star to have ""a third failed marriage under her belt,"" says the insider, ""there’s no coming back from Kanye’s latest meltdown.

"Caitlyn Marie Jenner (born William Bruce Jenner on October 28, 1949) is an American television personality and retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete.  Jenner was a college football player for the Graceland Yellowjackets before incurring a knee injury that required surgery. Coach L. D. Weldon, who had coached Olympic decathlete Jack Parker, convinced Jenner to try the decathlon. After intense training, Jenner won the 1976 Olympics decathlon event at the Montreal Olympic Games,[3][4] gaining fame as ""an all-American hero"".[5] Jenner set a third successive world record while winning the Olympics. The winner of the Olympic decathlon is traditionally given the unofficial title of ""world's greatest athlete"".[6] With that stature, Jenner subsequently established a career in television, film, writing, auto racing, business and as a Playgirl cover model.[7]  Jenner has six children with three successive wives: Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner. Since 2007, she has appeared on the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians with Kris, their daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and step-children Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian. Previously identifying publicly as male, Jenner revealed her identity as a trans woman in April 2015, publicly announcing her name change from Bruce to Caitlyn in a July 2015 Vanity Fair cover story. Her name and gender change became official on September 25, 2015.[8] She has been called the most famous openly transgender woman in the world.[9][10] From 2015 to 2016, Jenner starred in the reality television series I Am Cait, which focused on her gender transition.  Early life  Caitlyn Marie Jenner was born William Bruce Jenner on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York,[11] to Esther Ruth (née McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner. Her father was an arborist.[12][13] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and Welsh descent.[14] She has two sisters, Lisa and Pam.[15] Her younger brother, Burt, was killed in a car accident in Canton, Connecticut on November 30, 1976, shortly after Jenner's success at the Olympic Games.[16][17] As a young child, Jenner was diagnosed with dyslexia.[18]  Jenner attended Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, New York, for her freshman and sophomore years[19][20] and Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut, for her junior and senior years, graduating in 1968.[21] Jenner earned a football scholarship and attended Graceland College (now Graceland University) in Lamoni, Iowa, but was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury.[22] Recognizing Jenner's potential, Graceland track coach L. D. Weldon encouraged Jenner to switch to the decathlon.[23] In 1970, Jenner placed fifth while debuting in the decathlon at the Drake Relays in Des Moines, Iowa.[24] Jenner graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.[25]  Decathlon career  All Olympic events and medals are for men's events and prior to her gender transition.  Early career  At the 1972 U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, Jenner was in fifth place in the men's decathlon, behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes. Needing to make up a 19-second gap on Gough in the men's 1500 metres, Jenner qualified for the Olympic team by running a fast final lap, finishing 22 seconds ahead of the other runners. (Video on YouTube @25:58) This prompted the Eugene Register-Guard to ask: ""Who's Jenner?""[26][27] Following the Olympic Trials, Jenner finished in tenth place in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.[28] By watching Soviet Mykola Avilov win the event, Jenner was inspired to start an intense training regimen. ""For the first time, I knew what I wanted out of life and that was it, and this guy has it. I literally started training that night at midnight, running through the streets of Munich, Germany, training for the Games. I trained that day on through the 1976 Games, 6–8 hours a day, every day, 365 days a year.""[29]  Jenner at the 1975 Pan American Games  After graduating from Graceland, Jenner married girlfriend Chrystie Crownover and moved to San Jose, California. Chrystie provided most of the family income by working as a flight attendant for United Airlines.[30] Jenner trained during the day and sold insurance at night, earning US$9,000 a year.[31][32] In the era before professional athletes were allowed to compete in Olympic sports, this kind of training was unheard of. During this period, Jenner trained at the San Jose City College (SJCC) and San Jose State University (SJSU) tracks.[33][34] San Jose was centered around SJCC coach Bert Bonanno; at that time, the city was a hotbed for training and was called the ""Track Capital of the World"".[32] Many other aspiring Olympic athletes also trained at San Jose; the list included Millard Hampton, Andre Phillips, John Powell, Mac Wilkins, and Al Feuerbach.[33][35] Jenner's most successful events were the skill events of the second day: hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin and 1500 meters.[5][36]  Olympic success  Jenner was the American champion in the men's decathlon event in 1974, and was featured on the cover of Track & Field News magazine's August 1974 issue.[37][38] While on tour in 1975, Jenner won the French national championship,[39] and a gold medal at the 1975 Pan American Games, earning the tournament record with 8,045 points.[25] This was followed by new world records of 8,524 points at the U.S.A./U.S.S.R./Poland triangular meet in Eugene, Oregon on August 9–10, 1975, breaking Avilov's record,[40] and 8,538 points at the 1976 Olympic trials, also in Eugene.[27][41] The record in Eugene was a hybrid score because a timing system failure and wind aided marks. Still, Jenner was proud of “A nice little workout, huh?”  “We got what we wanted. We scared the hell out of everybody in the world only a month away from the Games.”[42]  Of the 13 decathlons Jenner competed in between 1973 and 1976, the only loss was at the 1975 AAU National Championships, when a ""no height"" in the pole vault marred the score.[25]  At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Jenner achieved five personal bests on the first day of the men's decathlon – a ""home run"" – despite being in second place behind Guido Kratschmer of West Germany. Jenner was confident: ""The second day has all my good events. If everything works out all right, we should be ahead after it's all over."" Following a rainstorm on the second day, Jenner watched teammate Fred Dixon get injured in the 110 meter hurdles,[43] so took a cautious approach to the hurdles and discus, then had personal bests in the pole vault, when Jenner took the lead, and javelin.[44] By that point, victory was virtually assured, but it remained to be seen by how much Jenner would improve the record. In the final event—the 1500 meters, which was seen live on national television—Jenner looked content to finish the long competition. Jenner sprinted the last lap, making up a 50-meter deficit and nearly catching the event favorite, Soviet Leonid Litvinenko, who was already well out of contention for the gold medal, but whose personal best had been eight seconds better than Jenner's personal best before the race. Jenner set a new personal best time and won the gold medal with a world-record score of 8,618 points.[5][27][29][45][46]  Olympic world record performance:[47]    100m (wind) Long jump (wind) Shot put High jump 400m 110H (wind) Discus Pole vault Javelin 1500m 10.94 +0.0 PB  819 7.22 +0.0 PB  865 15.35 PB  809 2.03 PB  882 47.51 PB  923 14.84  866 50.04  873 4.80 PB  1005 68.52 PB  862 4:12.61 PB  714  Impact  After the event, Jenner took an American flag from a spectator and carried it during the victory lap, starting a tradition that is now common among winning athletes.[48][49] Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: ""In 1972, I made the decision that I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, and then I would move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this.""[29] Jenner explained, ""It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got the rest of my life to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?""[5]  As a result of winning the Olympic decathlon, Jenner became a national hero and received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States and was also named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in 1976.[4][22]  Jenner's 1976 world and Olympic record was broken by four points by Daley Thompson at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow; Thompson's victory was perhaps tainted by the U.S. led boycott of the Moscow Olympics, though the top American at the time, Bobby Coffman, was not expected to push Thompson or challenge Jenner's record. In 1985, Jenner's Olympic decathlon score was reevaluated against the IAAF's updated decathlon scoring table and was reported as 8,634 for comparative purposes. This converted mark stood as the American record until 1991, when it was surpassed by eventual gold medalist, and world record holder, Dan O'Brien of Dan & Dave fame.[50] As of 2011 , Jenner was ranked twenty-fifth on the world all-time list and ninth on the American all-time list.[51] Including the 2012 emergence of a new world record holder Ashton Eaton, Jenner's mark has moved to No. 27 worldwide and No. 10 U.S.[52]  Jenner was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1980, the Olympic Hall of Fame in 1986, the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame and the Connecticut Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, and the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.[53] For almost 20 years, San Jose City College hosted an annual Bruce Jenner Invitational competition.[54][55][56]  International competitions  National events  Personal records  All information from IAAF[60]  Post-Olympic career  Capitalizing on Olympic fame  In the 1970s, Olympic athletes were considered to be amateurs and were not allowed to seek or accept payment for their positions as sports celebrities. During the Cold War in 1972, three major Olympic titles that had a long history of American success – basketball, the 100 meter dash, and decathlon – were won by Soviet athletes. Jenner became an American hero by returning the decathlon title to the United States. ""After the Games were over,"" Jenner said, ""I happened to be the right guy, at that right place, at that right time.""[29] Tony Kornheiser of The New York Times wrote: ""Jenner is twirling the nation like a baton. He and wife, Chrystie, are so high up on the pedestal of American heroism, it would take a crane to get them down.""[5][30][61]  After the expected Olympic success, Jenner planned to cash in on whatever celebrity status could follow a gold medal in the same mold as Johnny Weissmuller and Sonja Henie, who had become major movie stars following their gold medals. This would require forgoing any future Olympic competition. At the time, Jenner's agent George Wallach felt there was a four-year window – until the next Olympics – upon which to capitalize. Wallach reported that Jenner was being considered for the role of Superman, which ultimately went to Christopher Reeve. ""I really don't know how many offers we have,"" Wallach claimed. ""There are still unopened telegrams back at the hotel and you just can't believe the offers that poured in during the first two days.""[62]  Jenner appeared on the cover of the August 9, 1976, issue of Sports Illustrated,[63] the February 1979 issue of Gentleman's Quarterly,[64] and on the cover of Playgirl magazine.[7] Jenner became a spokesperson for Tropicana, Minolta, and Buster Brown shoes.[29] Jenner was also selected by the Kansas City Kings with the 139th overall pick in the seventh round of the 1977 NBA draft despite not having played basketball since high school.[65] The publicity stunt was executed by team president/general manager Joe Axelson to mock the Kansas City Chiefs' yearly claims that they planned on selecting “the best athlete available” in the National Football League Draft. Jenner was presented with a jersey customized with the number 8618, his Olympic-gold-medal-winning score, but would never appear as an active player with the Kings.[66]  Wheaties spokesperson  US$400 after she announced her transition in 2015.[67][68] Wheaties boxes featuring Jenner came out around the same time the athlete became a spokesperson for the breakfast cereal. A box would later sell on eBay forafter she announced her transition in 2015.  In 1977, Jenner became a spokesperson for Wheaties brand breakfast cereal and appeared in an iconic photograph on the cover of the cereal box. After taking over from Olympic champion Bob Richards, Jenner was second in a succession of athletes featured as spokespersons for the brand. Mary Lou Retton succeeded Jenner in 1984.[69]  On November 22, 1977, Jenner went to San Francisco to refute charges filed by San Francisco district attorney Joseph Freitas that General Mills—the maker of Wheaties—had engaged in deceptive advertising in its campaign that featured Jenner. Jenner liked Wheaties and ate the breakfast cereal two or three times a week, which supported the advertising campaign's claims. Two days later, Freitas withdrew the suit, saying that it was ""a case of overzealousness"" on the part of his staff.[70]  When Jenner came out as a trans woman in 2015, General Mills stated that: ""Bruce Jenner continues to be a respected member of Team Wheaties."" After a negative response to this initial statement, Mike Siemienas, General Mills's brand media relations manager, clarified it by saying: ""Bruce Jenner has been a respected member of Team Wheaties, and Caitlyn Jenner will continue to be.""[71]  Television and film career  Jenner starred in the disco-era Village People comedy Can't Stop the Music (1980). The movie was a flop. Jenner's performance was nominated for the 1980 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor; the film won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.[72] It was Jenner's only theatrical release until 2011. Jenner had some success with a television career, starring in the made-for-TV movies The Golden Moment: An Olympic Love Story[73] (1980) and Grambling's White Tiger (1981).[74] During the 1981–1982 season, Jenner became a semi-regular cast member in the police series CHiPs, guest-starring as Officer Steve McLeish for six episodes, substituting for star Erik Estrada, who was locked in a contract dispute with NBC and MGM.[3] Jenner also appeared in an episode of the sitcom Silver Spoons called ""Trouble with Words"", wherein her personal issues with dyslexia were revealed in a storyline about a recurring teenage character with the same problem.  Jenner appeared in the series Learn to Read[75] and in the video games Olympic Decathlon[76] (1981) and Bruce Jenner's World Class Decathlon (1996).[77] The ""hero shot"", the finish of the final event of the 1976 Olympic decathlon, and the Wheaties cover, were parodied by John Belushi on Saturday Night Live, endorsing ""Little Chocolate Donuts"".[78] In 1989, Jenner played herself in the comedy short Dirty Tennis written by James Van Patten.[79]  Jenner in 2012  Jenner has appeared in a variety of game shows and reality television programs, including starring with Grits Gresham in an episode of ABC's The American Sportsman.[80] The program features Gresham hunting, fishing, or shooting in exotic areas with celebrities. In the early 1990s, Jenner was the host of an infomercial for a stair-climbing exercise machine called the Stair Climber Plus.[81]  In January 2002, Jenner participated in an episode of the American series The Weakest Link, featuring Olympic athletes.[82] In February and March 2003, Jenner was part of the cast of the American series I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.[83] She made a cameo appearance in a season-three episode of The Apprentice, which aired in May 2005.[84] She also partnered with Tai Babilonia for Skating with Celebrities[85] in a series that aired January – March 2006 (they were eliminated during the fifth of seven episodes), served as a guest judge on Pet Star on Animal Planet,[86] as well as (with the Kardashian family) on Celebrity Family Feud.[87] In November 2010, a photograph of Jenner was shown in a janitor's resume in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.[88]  Additional television and talk show appearances by Jenner include: Nickelodeon's made-for-TV film Gym Teacher: The Movie[89] as well as episodes of Murder, She Wrote,[90] Family Guy,[91] the Lingo Olympic Winners episode,[92] and talk shows such as Hannity[93] and season 1, episode 21 of The Bonnie Hunt Show in 2008.[94]  Since late 2007, Jenner has starred in the E! reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians along with wife Kris Jenner, stepchildren Kourtney, Kimberley, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian (from Kris's marriage to attorney Robert Kardashian), and daughters Kylie and Kendall.[95]  In 2011, Jenner appeared in the Adam Sandler comedy Jack and Jill in a scene with Al Pacino as an actor in a play.[96] Like Can't Stop the Music, the film won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture and swept every Razzie category.[97]  In September 2016, Jenner appeared as herself on the Amazon Prime TV series Transparent in a dream sequence during the season three episode ""To Sardines and Back"".[98]  Motorsports career  Jenner was a successful race car driver in the IMSA Camel GT series (International Motor Sports Association) in the 1980s.[99] Jenner's first victory came in the 1986 12 hours of Sebring in the IMSA GTO class driving the 7-Eleven Roush Racing Ford Mustang with co-driver Scott Pruett. The pair won their class and finished 4th overall in the 12-hour endurance race. 1986 was also the most successful year of Jenner's career, finishing second in the championship to Pruett.[100][101] Jenner commented, ""I was a lot more badass runner than I was a driver.""[102]  Business  Jenner had licensed her previous name for Bruce Jenner's Westwood Centers for Nautilus & Aerobics in the early 1980s to David A. Cirotto, president of other local Nautilus & Aerobics Centers. She had no ownership in the licensed name centers,[31] which were solely owned by Cirotto.[103] Jenner's company, Bruce Jenner Aviation, sells aircraft supplies to executives and corporations.[31] Jenner was the business development vice president for a staffing industry software application known as JennerNet, which was based on Lotus Domino technology.[104]  In March 2016, Jenner announced that she had been chosen as the face of H&M Sport.[105] Later that year, H&M created a six-minute film featuring Jenner, called Caitlyn Jenner's Greatest Victories: A Timeline.[106]  Gender transition  Coming out as a transgender woman  The Washington Post commented that Jenner's debut Vanity Fair cover, shot by [6][107] commented that Jenner's debutcover, shot by Annie Leibovitz , had special significance for its subject: ""After all the magazine covers that featured the former athlete, once lauded as the 'world's greatest athlete,' the Leibovitz photograph will be the most meaningful. Looking directly at the camera, Jenner is finally herself for the first time publicly.""  In a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in April 2015, Jenner came out as a trans woman, saying that she had dealt with gender dysphoria since her youth and that, ""for all intents and purposes, I'm a woman."" Jenner cross-dressed for many years and took hormone replacement therapy but stopped after her romance with Kris Kardashian became more serious, leading to marriage in 1992.[108][109][110] Jenner recounts having permission to explore her gender identity on her own travels but not when they were coupled, and that not knowing the best way to talk about the many issues contributed to the deterioration of the 23-year-long marriage, which ended formally in 2015.[110]  Jenner has undergone cosmetic surgery, and completed sex reassignment surgery in January 2017.[111] She said she has never been sexually attracted to men, but has instead always been sexually attracted to women, and that, keeping in mind the difficulty people have understanding the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity, she will identify as asexual for now.[112][113]  Media attention  In June 2015, Jenner debuted her new name and image, and began publicly using feminine pronoun self-descriptors.[114] Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name Caitlyn Marie Jenner.[115][116] Prior to her 20/20 interview, a two-part special titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce was filmed with the family in which she answered questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition.[117] In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized that there is no one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to ensure that all her children were independent first before focusing on her transition.[117] In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.[118]  Jenner's announcement that she is transgender came at an unprecedented time for trans visibility, including legislative initiatives.[119][120] The 20/20 interview had 20.7 million viewers, making it television's ""highest-ever rated newsmagazine telecast among adults 18–49 and adults 25–54"".[121] The Daily Beast wrote that Jenner's honesty, vulnerability, and fame may have caused ""cheap jokes"" about trans people to ""seem mean to a mainstream audience on an unprecedented scale"".[122] Noting the shift in how comedians treated Jenner's transition, The Daily Beast saw the change as the same evolution that took place in acceptance of LGBT people as a whole when ""comedians finally cross the critical threshold from mockery to creativity in their joke-telling"".[122]  Jenner's emerging gender identity was revealed in a Vanity Fair interview written by Buzz Bissinger. Annie Leibovitz photographed the cover, the magazine's first to feature an openly transgender woman, which was captioned ""Call me Caitlyn"".[123][124] Using her Twitter handle, @Caitlyn_Jenner, she tweeted: ""I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me."" Time magazine declared this tweet the tenth most re-tweeted tweet of 2015, based on re-tweets of tweets by verified users from January 1 to November 10 of that year. Jenner amassed over one million Twitter followers in four hours and three minutes, setting a new Guinness World Record and surpassing United States President Barack Obama, who, a month before, accomplished the same feat in four hours and fifty-two minutes.[126][127] Four days later Jenner was up to 2.37 million followers, with another 1.5 million followers on Instagram.[128]  However, Jenner was also mocked. Beginning in September 2015, she was depicted on the satirical American animated program South Park, which parodied her supporters' political correctness, as well as her driving record. The Jenner-related episodes were ""Stunning and Brave"", ""Where My Country Gone?"", ""Sponsored Content"", ""Truth and Advertising"" and ""PC Principal Final Justice"" from the show's 19th season.[129][130][131]  In April 2016 during the Republican presidential primaries, Jenner became an exemplar for candidate Donald Trump's opposition to North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, with Trump saying that Jenner could use any restroom of her choosing at his Trump Tower property. Jenner soon posted a video showing that she had taken Trump up on his offer. She thanked Trump and assured Trump's adversary Ted Cruz that ""nobody got molested"".[132][133]  In June 2016, Jenner was one of several celebrities depicted using synthetic nude ""sleeping"" bodies for the video of Kanye West's song ""Famous"".[134] Later that month, an episode of Epic Rap Battles of History was released featuring Jenner, as Bruce (portrayed by Peter Shukoff) and then Caitlyn (portrayed by transgender rapper Jolie ""NoShame"" Drake), rap battling against The Hulk (portrayed by Lloyd Ahlquist).  Reception  General  In August 2015, Jenner won the Social Media Queen award at the Teen Choice Awards.[135] In October 2015, Glamour magazine named her one of its 25 Glamour Women of the Year, calling her a ""Trans Champion.""[136] In November 2015, Jenner was listed as one of Entertainment Weekly's 2015 Entertainers of the Year.[137] In December 2015, she was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of 2015.[138] Also in that month, she was listed on Time magazine's eight-person shortlist for the 2015 Person of the Year,[139] and Bing released its list of the year's ""Most Searched Celebrities"", which Jenner was at the top of, and declared Jenner's Vanity Fair cover the second in a list of ""top celeb moments of 2015.""[140][141] She was the second most searched for person on Google in 2015.[142] In April 2016, she was listed in the Time 100.[143] In June 2016, Jenner became the first openly transgender person to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. The cover and associated story marked the 40th anniversary of her winning the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon.[144][145]  Feminist author Germaine Greer called Glamour magazine's decision to award Jenner with a ""Woman of the Year"" award misogynistic, questioning whether a transgender woman could be better than ""someone who is just born a woman.""[146] Jenner also received criticism from individuals such as actress Rose McGowan, for stating – in a BuzzFeed interview[147] – that the hardest part about being a woman ""is figuring out what to wear"". McGowan argued: ""We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well fucking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege."" McGowan later stated that she was not transphobic, and added: ""Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism.""[148][149]  Chris Mandle of The Independent stated: ""Jenner has gone on to inspire countless men and women, but her comments, which were made after she was celebrated at Glamour magazine's Women Of The Year in New York were branded 'offensive and insulting'."" He added: ""People began tweeting the other, harder things women have to deal with, such as institutionalized oppression, abuse and sexual assault"".[150] James Smith, husband of Moira Smith, the only female New York Police Department officer to die on September 11, 2001, returned Moira's ""Woman of the Year"" award, given posthumously. Referring to Jenner as a man, he stated that he found Glamour giving Jenner the same award insulting to Moira's memory, and referred to the matter as a publicity stunt.[151][152] Smith later said that, having supported transgender youth and Glamour's decision to honor transgender actress Laverne Cox in 2014, he did not object because Jenner is transgender; he objected to Jenner's ""hardest part about being a woman"" commentary; this proved to him that Jenner ""is not truly a woman. I believe this comment and others he has made trivializes the transgender experience as I have witnessed it.""[153]  Conversely, Adrienne Tam of The Daily Telegraph argued that Jenner deserved the Glamour award, stating: ""What McGowan failed to take into consideration was the jesting manner in which Jenner spoke."" Tam said:  [Jenner] also immediately followed up her ""what women wear"" dilemma with: It's more than that. I'm kind of at this point in my life where I'm trying to figure this womanhood thing out. It is more than hair, makeup, clothes, all that kind of stuff. There's an element here that I'm still kind of searching for. And I think that'll take a while. Because I think as far as gender, we're all on a journey. We're all learning and growing about ourselves. And I feel the same way.  Tam considered McGowan's criticism to be over the top, and stated of James Smith's criticism, ""The salient point here is one about courage. We easily recognise physical courage such as saving orphans from burning buildings, or ordinary people putting their lives in the line of fire. It is far harder to recognise mental courage."" She added: ""Without a doubt, the police officer who died in the September 11 attacks was courageous. But so is Jenner. It's a different kind of courage, but it is courage nonetheless.""[154]  LGBT community  With her profile raised by her coming out as a trans woman in 2015, Jenner has been called the most famous openly transgender woman in the world.[8][9][10] She is also one of the most recognized LGBT people in the world and arguably the most famous LGBT athlete.[155] Jenner acknowledged in her 20/20 interview that part of her reason for being so visible was to bring attention to gender dysphoria, violence against trans women, and other transgender issues.[156] She also sought to promote more informed discussion of LGBT issues at a time when the trans community has unprecedented visibility.[156] She signed with Creative Artists Agency's speakers department and will collaborate with the CAA Foundation on a philanthropic strategy focusing on LGBT issues.[157] She made a private appearance at the Los Angeles LGBT Center in June 2015, where she spoke with at-risk trans youth.[158]  Jenner received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the 2015 ESPY Awards in July 2015. ESPN executive producer Maura Mandt said Jenner was given the award because ""she has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.""[159] She is the third consecutive openly LGBT person to receive the award following footballer Michael Sam (2014) and anchorwoman Robin Roberts (2013).[160]  In October, Jenner presented the Point Foundation's Horizon Award to television producers Rhys Ernst (of the show Transparent) and Zach Zyskowski (of the show Becoming Us).[161][162] This was her second public speaking engagement after her gender transition.[162]  In November, Jenner was listed as one of the nine runners-up for The Advocate's Person of the Year.[163] That month she was also listed as one of the Out100 of 2015, with Out calling her the ""Newsmaker of the Year.""[164] On International Human Rights Day, Jenner discussed transgender rights with Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.[165] In 2016, Jenner was on the cover of The Advocate's February/March issue.[166]  MAC Cosmetics collaborated with Jenner on a lipstick, called Finally Free, which was made available for purchase April 8, 2016, with MAC stating, ""100% of the selling price goes to the MAC AIDS Fund Transgender Initiative, to further its work in support of transgender communities.""[167][168] Also in April 2016, Jenner was listed as No. 8 on Out magazine's Power 50 list.[169][170] In May 2016, her interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015 won Outstanding TV Journalism – Newsmagazine at the GLAAD Media Awards.[171]  In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Jenner and others told the stories of the people killed there.[172][173]  In July 2016, Jenner spoke about coming out as transgender and Republican at a Republican National Convention ""Big Tent Brunch"" for the conservative group American Unity Fund.[174][175]  Show and memoir  Jenner's gender transition is the subject of I Am Cait, initially an eight-part TV documentary series, which premiered on E! in July 2015 to an audience of 2.7 million viewers.[176][177][178] Jenner is an executive producer of the show.[179] The show focuses on Jenner's transition and how it affects her relationships with her family and friends. The show also explores how Jenner adjusts to what she sees as her job as a role model for the transgender community.[180][181] In October 2015, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2016.[182] The show tied for best Outstanding Reality Program at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2016.[183][184]  Jenner's memoir, The Secrets of My Life, was published on April 25, 2017.[185]  Politics  Jenner is a Christian, leans towards political conservatism and is a Republican.[186][187] ""I have gotten more flak for being a conservative Republican than I have for being trans,"" she has said.[188] Although stopping short of an endorsement, Jenner said she liked Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, despite Cruz's negative views of trans people.[189] On her reality show I Am Cait, Jenner said that although she does not support Donald Trump, she thinks he would be good for women's issues; she then stated she would never support Hillary Clinton.[190] She ended up voting for Trump in the 2016 presidential elections.[191]  In February 2017, President Trump rescinded federal requirements giving transgender students the right to choose the school restroom matching their gender identity. In response, Jenner tweeted ""Well @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.""[192]  In April 2017, Jenner said she was in favor of same-sex marriage.[193]  In July 2017, Jenner announced that she was contemplating running in the 2018 race for the US Senate to represent California.[194]  Later in the month, she condemned Trump for issuing an order to reinstate a ban on transgender people from serving in the military. In her tweet, she wrote ""What happened to your promise to fight for them?"", juxtaposing it with Trump's tweet from June 2016 in which he promised to fight for the LGBT community.[191]  Personal life  Marriages  Prior to her public gender transition, Jenner had been married three times, first to Chrystie Scott (née Crownover) from 1972 to 1981. They have two children, son Burton ""Burt"" Jenner and daughter Cassandra ""Casey"" Marino (née Jenner).[195][196] Jenner and Scott's divorce was finalized the first week of January 1981.[197]  On January 5, 1981, Jenner married actress Linda Thompson in Hawaii.[198] They have two sons together, Brandon Jenner and Sam Brody Jenner (known as Brody).[199] By February 1986, Jenner and Thompson had separated and subsequently divorced.[200] Their sons later starred on the reality show The Princes of Malibu,[201] and Brody appeared in the reality show The Hills.[202]  On April 21, 1991, Jenner married Kris Kardashian (née Houghton) after five months of dating.[203] They have two daughters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner. While married, Jenner was also the step-parent to Kris's children from her previous marriage – Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Robert – who star in Keeping Up with the Kardashians. The couple announced their separation in October 2013,[204][205] though they had actually separated in June.[206] Kris filed for divorce in September 2014 citing irreconcilable differences.[207] Their divorce terms were finalized in December 2014 and went into effect on March 23, 2015, because of a six-month state legal requirement.[208]  Fatal car collision  In February 2015, Jenner was involved in a fatal multiple-vehicle collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. Kim Howe, an animal rights activist and actress, was killed when Jenner's SUV ran into Howe's car. Accounts of the sequence of collisions have varied, as have the number of people injured.[209] Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges, but three civil lawsuits were brought by Howe's stepchildren and drivers of other cars involved in the collision.[210][211] Jessica Steindorff, a Hollywood agent who was hit by Howe's car, settled her case in December 2015. Howe's stepchildren settled their case in January 2016.[212] Financial details were not disclosed in either case.[213]  See also",0

"A dispute in Angela Merkel’s coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader’s own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor’s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent’s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That’s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel’s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it’s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn’t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party’s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It’s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany’s ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU are sister parties, with a joint parliamentary caucus and electoral program. Think of the CSU as the center-right’s Bavarian chapter — the CDU operates in all of Germany’s 16 states except Bavaria.So a breach would be drastic, but not unprecedented. In 1976, CSU chairman Franz-Josef Strauss called off the joint caucus, but the split was short-lived. For the Bavarians, going it alone would theoretically open a path for the CDU to campaign in Bavaria, weakening the CSU’s position.A hoax tweet that rattled markets on Friday raised exactly that possibility. It presented a fake quote from the CDU state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, as saying his party should prepare to set up a Bavarian chapter for the next national election. Merkel’s chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, quickly stepped in to say the report was invented. “We should all remain calm,” he said.",0
"Jennifer Lawrence said a peculiar thing the other day while talking about Joy, her new film for the notably ""difficult"" director David O. Russell. ""David respects me so much that he will literally forget what sex I am,"" she said with a laugh. ""He sometimes refers to me as a 'he' without realising it."" For anyone interested in gender identity, there is a can of worms right there: even for the charmingly feisty Lawrence, apparently, real acceptance means being counted as one of the boys.  At the same time, Lawrence's honorary gender neutrality invites some reflections on the working partnerships between directors and actors, which can last through several films or even entire careers. This does not, necessarily, mean becoming one of the boys. Some actors – traditionally women – are recognised as muses, inspiring the male directors who construct scenarios around them and explore their faces with the camera. Many muses have become partners or wives: Ingrid Bergman with Roberto Rossellini, Anna Karina and Jean-Luc Godard and Gena Rowlands with John Cassavetes spring to mind, but the list is a long one.  Indeed, the muse model is so pervasive that it has become one of the defining ways we read films. Years ago, I interviewed the French director Leos Carax about the film Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, which starred his then lover Juliette Binoche. As a student, he readily admitted, he would go to the tiny cinemas on the Left Bank to screenings of old movies by Fellini (whose wife Giulietta Masina was his favoured leading lady) or Antonioni (Monica Vitti) and dream of someday directing a film and having a beautiful girlfriend: for him, the work and the woman were so intertwined as to be synonymous. He had then been with Binoche for three years; I wasn't to know they were going through the throes of splitting up. What was it like to work with someone he knew so well? ""I do not think,"" he spat, ""that I know her well at all.""  Such is the ambivalence of the artist-muse relationship: it can be scratchy, even explosive. But even in a relationship as clearly collaborative as that between German director Christian Petzold and the actor Nina Hoss, who have made six films together as platonic friends, there still is a gap of understanding. Hoss believes that difference is a source of strength. ""Even though we are friends, I always have the feeling that Christian thinks he doesn't quite understand me – and I like that,"" she told me in the course of discussing their new film Phoenix. ""I think the ideas he puts into his characters have a lot to do with him, which may be why he always chooses women. It gives him some distance, which keeps it alive and interesting. And I think I am able to surprise him.""",0
"Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month.Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline.Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas.In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma.The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017.A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program.“The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.",0
"Real Housewives of Orange County star Shannon Beador took to Instagram in October after filming the season 12 reunion show to thank her makeup artist for “continual touch ups on a very emotional day.” She wasn’t just being dramatic  In the Bravo special that aired on Monday, November 20, a heartbroken Shannon revealed that her husband, David Beador, was the one to end their 17 year marriage in September. “It’s not what I wanted and it’s been really, really hard,” she admitted through tears. “We went on a trip to Hawaii, which I kind of hoped would bring everything together, but he left the trip early. And when I came home, he said, ‘We’re done,’” Shannon told host Andy Cohen.  “I said to David, when he told me it was over, ‘What happened? We had a couple of amazing years,’” she recalled of the conversation. “And he goes, ‘We had a couple good months.’ It was just a knife in the heart.”  Celebrity Splits of 2017  Shannon wasn’t totally shocked by David’s gut-wrenching announcement. There were warning signs that their relationship was circling the drain. “I did have a conversation with him at the beginning of the summer that I just couldn’t keep living this way,” she said, adding that he lived in a separate wing of the house.  Though Shannon called the breakup “heartbreaking,” the mom of Sophie, 15, and 12-year-old twins Stella and Adeline sees a silver lining.  Hollywood’s Ugliest Divorces  “I’m a role model for my kids and and it got to the point where I wasn’t teaching my daughters positive lessons,” she explained. “They deserve a happy and joyful home and that’s where we are now . . . it’s my job now to show the girls — I’m scared, I’m 53 years old, it’s the first time I’ve been out on my own, but I can do it.”  Sophie, Stella and Adeline have been living with Shannon full-time since the separation, but see their dad regularly. “We’ve agreed for the benefit of our daughters to be amicable,” Shannon said. “It was always a tradition to go to Sunday night dinner so we meet him for dinner on Sunday nights. And we still go to the USC games and take the kids, which is hard, but it’s a benefit for them.”  The Biggest ‘Real Housewives’ Fights Ever: A Definitive Ranking  The former couple’s tumultuous marriage has been chronicled on RHOC since Shannon joined the cast in 2014. Though David was allegedly unfaithful, the two spent time in therapy and even renewed their vows in August 2016.

"Taylor Swift. Andrew H. Walker/Getty  Representatives for Taylor Swift have told streaming services that the pop star's upcoming album, ""Reputation,"" will be kept off streaming during its first week of sales, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw.  Bloomberg's sources said that the streaming services are still negotiating with Swift to determine when ""Reputation"" will be available.  Swift has had a back-and-forth relationship with streaming services in recent years.  The singer kept her last album, ""1989,"" off of Spotify upon its release in 2014, when she removed her entire back catalog from the service.  In July 2014, months prior to the album's release, Swift wrote an op-ed condemning Spotify's free tier in the Wall Street Journal, writing, ""It's my opinion that music should not be free.""  Swift allowed ""1989"" to stream on Apple Music, which does not offer a free tier, upon that service's launch in January 2015.  She eventually made her back catalog and ""1989"" available to stream on Spotify in June, after ""1989"" had sold over 10 million copies.  ""Reputation"" will be available for sale in retail outlets and online stores like the iTunes on November 10.",0
"They only romanced for a matter of months, but it didn’t stop Howard Stern from hoping their relationship could have been so much more.  Speaking to Jake Gyllenhaal about his love affair with Taylor Swift on Wednesday, the shock jock said he wanted the actor to take it all the way to the altar.  Speaking on his Sirius XM show Howard told Jake: ‘I feel—and this is me stepping in—you should have married Taylor Swift, and I'll tell you why…What a power couple!’  Scroll down for video  Third degree: Jake Gyllenhaal was quizzed on his romance with Taylor Swift on Wednesday when he made an appearance on the Howard Stern XFM show  The Southpaw actor, 34, responded: ‘Oh, that's the reason?’  Howard, 61, who was now in his stride, revealed he was ‘super attracted’ to Taylor and said if he had been friends with Jake when they were dating, he would have told him she was worth staying with long term.  The Nightcrawler star, who dated the ‘Shake It Off’ singer for three months back in 2010 admitted: ‘She’s a beautiful girl.’  Romance: He dated the singer for three months in 2010  Jake joked: ‘Why didn't you have me on this show sooner?’  Howard, warming to his topic continued: ‘I would have said, “Jake, this is The One.”  ‘Because to me, nothing is sexier than a woman who can play songs and write.’  Robin Quivers who co-hosts with Howard then brought up Taylor had written a song about her relationship with Jake – their break up is said to have inspired tracks on the Red album.  To the altar: Howard pressed the actor for details and then said he thought they should have got hitched  Jake, feigning ignorance said: ‘Do I?’  Howard chimed in asking which one it was.  The actor replied: ‘I don't know...This is all Robin. She's looking it up right now. She's feverishly looking it up online.’  Howard then asked Jake if he was in love at the moment, who responded he wasn’t.  When asked if he was upset about it, Jake replied: ‘Yeah. I love love, man. Are you kidding me?’  Howard then asked: ‘How many times in your life have you really been in love—really in love?’  Jake answered: ‘Three times but didn’t name any names. He then added: ‘Twice.’  Big love: Jake was asked if he had ever been in love - he said twice. It is thought he was referring to his relationship with Kirsten Dunst - they are pictured here at the American Museum of Natural History in New York in 2004  It is thought he may have been referring to his relationship with Kirsten Dunst, whom he dated from 2002 to 2004, and also Reese Witherspoon, whom he was with for three years from 2007 to 2009.  When asked if something held him back from getting married he revealed it was him and said: ‘I think I probably just got scared.’  However he also said: 'There are a lot of beautiful women, there are opportunities, but I think at the same time, if you find the right person, I believe in monogamy I believe in when you meet somebody who is right it will be right and you will stay there.'  Happy: It thought he was also referring to Reese Witherspoon, whom he was with for three years from 2007 to 2009  Howard also addressed Jakes appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, where Taylor’s song Bad Blood played in the background as the actor was being interviewed.  It became an issue on social media as it was thought the show may have been attempting to make an association between the pair.  Jake reiterated he was unaware of the music, saying: ‘First of all, I did not hear that...When I'm doing an interview when you're up at 5 a.m. and you can't really make sense of words, you're not thinking about the background music that's playing behind you.’  Oops! The star was also asked about his appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, where they played a Taylor Swift song when he came on set  ‘So they aren't they sabotaging you in a sense?’ Howard asked.  ‘Oh, please!’ the actor retorted. ‘Good Morning America?’  When asked if he would have recognised it was a song by Taylor Jake said adamantly he would.  Howard pressed on: ‘You are not defined by dating Taylor Swift. But they are defining you with a Taylor Swift song.’  Jake joked: ‘There are dark things that happen on Good Morning America. That is not one of them.’",1
"Justin Bieber Dodges Water Bottle From Crowd After Refusing to Sing 'Despacito': 'I Don't Even Know It'  While fans may know the lyrics to Justin Bieber's guest spot on the Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee hit ""Despacito"" word for word, it seems that the star isn't quite up to speed.  The Biebs refused to sing the primarily Spanish-language remix while performing at Summerburst Festival in Stockholm over the weekend -- and almost got struck by an attendee's water bottle for it.  ""I can't do 'Despacito,'"" Bieber admitted onstage after an audience member requested the track. ""I don't even know it.""  While some crowd members continued to cheer, one pelted a water bottle at Bieber, just missing the singer's head. ""Don't throw things at me, please,"" Bieber responded calmly.  It's not the first time ""Despacito"" has brought Bieber trouble: When he tried to perform the Song of the Summer contender at New York City club 1OAK in May, fans caught the singer ad-libbing ""I don't know the words, so I say 'Dorito,'"" in between mumbled lyrics.  Fonsi, for one, has forgiven Bieber before for messing up the lyrics, admitting himself that ""the chorus is not easy to sing."" And none of this has diminished the success of the song, which is currently leading the Billboard Hot 100 for the fifth consecutive week.  Watch the whole Summerburst Fest scene go down in the fan-uploaded video below:",0
"COSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California’s Republican convention on Friday.",1
"Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum announced in early April that they're separating after eight years of marriage. Naturally, the news came as a shock to Tatum's and Dewan's fans —though they took solace in the fact that the split is seemingly amicable. In their statement announcing the news, Tatum and Dewan said they'd ""lovingly chosen"" to separate and that ""nothing has changed"" about how much they love each other.  It's not so surprising, then, that Dewan was completely gracious on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Wednesday (May 2) after DeGeneres accidentally called her ""Jenna Dewan Tatum.""  ""Please welcome Jenna Dewan Tatum—Jenna Dewan, sorry,"" DeGeneres said right before bringing her and the other World of Dance judges out to discuss their show. Before the segment wrapped, DeGeneres apologized for her slip-up. ""I'm so sorry; I introduced you [as Jenna Dewan Tatum], and it was just such a habit. I have to say the way that you and Channing are handling everything is beautiful—for your daughter [Everly], and the statements have been great. And I apologize. I just have known both of you for so long, and I'm so used to saying it.""  Dewan's response was warm and calm. ""I know, thank you. And, honestly, thank you—and everybody—for all the love and support. It's truly so moving,"" she said.  Watch all this happen for yourself in the video below:  ""There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision—just two best friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible,"" Dewan and Tatum also said in their joint statement about the split.

"DEMI MOORE SAYS SHE SAVED her from some major business mistakes. Rosanna Arquette says she helped save her daughter’s life. Brad Pitt likes to drop by and play with her 5-year-old son Samson; wellness guru Deepak Chopra calls for advice. And Laura Day, the object of all this celebrity attention? “I’m not what you expect,” she insists. “I’m just your basic, straitlaced Jewish woman.”  Who believes—as do her fans—that she has a highly accurate sense of intuition. “Intuition allows us to predict events,” claims Day, 38. She maintains that everyone has such abilities,, waiting to be developed; her 1996 how-to book, Practical Intuition, sold 133,000 hardcover copies, and her 1997 follow-up, Practical Intuition for Success, is the first part of a two-book, $3 million deal. Before becoming an author, Day earned as much as $5,000 a session advising filmmakers (on script and casting problems) and business executives (about market trends). “I don’t see hallucinations, it’s just a flash of something in my head,” says Day, who’s wary of being thought of as some spacey psychic or guru. “I’m not magical or New Age or a spiritual leader. There’s nothing that sets me apart from anyone else.”  So how to explain all those A-list amigos? “She’s very open and loving,” says Arquette, who met Day through a mutual friend, rocker Peter Gabriel. In 1996, Arquette phoned Day to tell her that her daughter Zoe, then 2, had a fever and diarrhea, which a doctor had said was the flu. “I had a very clear feeling that Zoe was going to die,” recalls Day, who saw to it that the girl was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a rare form of blood poisoning. “Laura’s information saved Zoe’s life,” says Arquette. “It was intense.”  Day’s friendships with Hollywood heavyweights have helped her, too. When HarperCollins didn’t throw a bash for her second book last October, her friends, including close pal Brad Pitt, threw her a party instead. Demi Moore—or “Aunt Demi,” as she’s known to Samson—worked with Day on the set of 199l’s The Butcher’s Wife, in which Moore played a psychic. “Laura has given me a trust in my own intuition,” says the actress, who won’t reveal much about the business situation gone wrong but admits it would have been worse without Day’s intervention. “I took a greater position of responsibility,” says Moore. “Laura put me back in the driver’s seat.”  Day says she discovered her special way of seeing things at an early age. The oldest of four children born in New York City to David Globus, now 67 and an internist, and Vivian, a full-time mother, Day was 11 when her mother, who suffered from depression, slipped into a coma after a suicide attempt. “I wanted her to live,” says Day, “and I needed to know what to do.” She recalls having an instinct to channel her own warmth and energy into Vivian’s body. Her mother pulled through but, three years later, succeeded in taking her own life.  Day went on to study philosophy and religion at Syracuse University and, in 1979, at age 20, married Lee Day, now 39 and a Web site designer. Twelve years later they separated, and eight months after that, Day gave birth to their son Samson. Facing a mound of bills from a divorce that is still being litigated, Day, who had been teaching intuition workshops and taking a few consulting jobs, wondered how she could make ends meet and still be a full-time mother. “At the point when you’re most lost,” says Day, “that’s when intuition kicks in.”  Intuition said: Write a book. Her ensuing success—she writes two hours a day and is now working on Intuition and Love, a guide to finding a mate—allows her to “do bake sales and book sales and be a very involved parent.” A perfect evening is cooking for a gaggle of friends in her New York City loft, which she and Samson share with a cat, three lizards, a mouse and nine fish. “People are drawn to Laura,” says Adam Robinson, 42, an educator and Day’s boyfriend of three years. “She makes them feel at ease and accepted. She radiates empathy.”  And yet, Day only rarely gets intuitive about her own life, despite the success that trusting her gut has brought her. “I don’t want my environment perfect,” she says. “I work very hard to live in the moment. I’m interested in how I’m feeling right now.”  ALEX TRESNIOWSKI    DEBBIE SEAMAN in New York City",0
"That’s right, everyone, the time is near—the week we have all been waiting for is upon us: Pippa Middleton is set to marry James Matthews this weekend in London. (It’s still not too late to book your ticket now to London—yeah, you won’t be able to attend the wedding itself, but you can still sort of camp out nearby and listen for sounds.)  There are no doubt scores of spreadsheets and multiple binders dedicated to making sure everything goes smoothly for Kate’s sister’s nuptials, and most of the plans remain under wraps. And there is a great number of questions about the wedding itself, including what Pippa will be wearing, and what Kate’s exact role will be, and whether or not we will be gifted with a shot of Meghan Markle and Prince George shaking hands. But what we do know, per a new E! report, is how Pippa, reportedly, has been preparing for the wedding.  The outlet claims that Pippa has completed a “strict bridal body boot camp,” a three-month program run out of Grace Belgravia health club. The program, in its description, doesn’t sound too different from a (intensive) gym membership that you might read about a famous person partaking in; the components include “a personal trainer, skincare and leg toning treatments, plus yoga, pilates, spinning, cardio training, dance and meditation classes” and “the club also offers to arrange home deliveries of specialized healthy meals.”  Oh, wait, there’s also this, which sounds positively Paltrow-ian: “The club also has a team of doctors and specialists who can help with anti-aging treatments including botox, peels, fillers, microdermabrasion and an assortment of laser treatments, as well as IV therapies.” E! notes, of course, that it is “unclear if Pippa has undergone such procedures.”  Their source claims that Pippa has “met with her PT about five times a week and mostly sticks to cardio and pilates.” Per the source: “She feels amazing. Her diet is the healthiest ever—she hasn’t even had a glass of wine in months. She’s had facial treatments sometimes once a week or once a fortnight.”  This truly is an impressive feat, as, just over the course of writing this post, we have finished off two glasses of wine and did not complete a single facial treatment.

"Tyler Hoechlin returning as Superman for crossover, Lois Lane to appear  DC has announced that Tyler Hoechlin (Teen Wolf, Supergirl) will be returning to The CW as Superman in this year’s annual Arrowverse superhero crossover event. The Man of Steel will also be joined by Lois Lane, marking the power couple’s DCTV crossover debut.  Hoechlin made his first appearance as Clark Kent in season two of Supergirl as Kara Danvers legendary cousin. After being featured in four episodes of the series, Hoechlin will put back on his cape as we wait to see who will be cast to play Lois Lane.  The CW recently set the dates for the annual crossover, with this year’s storyline heading to Gotham City, a place previously off-limits to The CW. The crossover will start with The Flash on Sunday, December 9. Arrow will continue the story on Monday, December 10, before it all comes to an end in Supergirl on Tuesday, December 11. DC’s Legends of Tomorrow is sitting out of this year’s event, and Black Lightning has yet to establish any firm links with the Arrowverse.  Season 3 saw Supergirl stop Reign and the other Worldkillers’ threat to humanity and our planet, and in the process, Kara was shocked to find her mother Alura alive and living in a salvaged Argo City that survived the destruction of Krypton. Reconnecting with her past caused Kara to realize that her true home is now here on Earth, where big changes are taking place for her and all of her friends in National City – and also, it appears, for a doppelganger in Russia! Season four promises to be full of surprises, action, adventure and lots of big revelations for Supergirl, Alex, James, J’onn, Lena and Brainy.  Supergirl stars Melissa Benoist as Kara Danvers/Supergirl, Mehcad Brooks as James Olsen, Chyler Leigh as Alex Danvers, Jeremy Jordan as Winslow ‘Winn’ Schott, Katie McGrath as Lena Luthor, Jess Rath as Brainiac 5, and David Harewood as Hank Henshaw/J’onn J’onnz. New to the cast for the fourth season is Sam Witwer as hero Agent Liberty.  Based on the DC characters created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the series is executive produced by Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller. Supergirl is produced by Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television.  Supergirl season four will premiere on The CW on its new night, Sunday, October 14, at 8:00 p.m.  Are you excited for Hoechlin to return as Superman? Who do you want to see play Lois Lane?

"That's a wrap for ""Southern Charm New Orleans."" Sunday night's episode of the unscripted Bravo series marked the finale of its first season -- and, one has to believe, probably the finale of the series as a whole.  Of course, the Bravo suits could always surprise us and renew it for a sophomore season. But the fact of the matter is that the show had trouble building a steady audience from the beginning. In fact, after debuting April 25 to more than 1 million viewers, it didn't build at all, posting a viewership decline with nearly every episode, according to figures from ShowBuzz Daily.  Last week's penultimate episode marked the low-water mark, drawing fewer viewers -- 640,000 -- than any other episode so far this season. Nothing charming about that. (Viewership figures on Sunday's eighth and final episode were not available.)  By comparison, the ""Southern Charm"" mother ship, from which ""SoCharm NOLA"" was spun off, has yet to register fewer than 1 million voters in any of the nine episodes that have aired so far as part of its fifth season.  So, while there will certainly be some people who will mourn the end of ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" should Bravo decide to pass on a second season, I've got a feeling most people won't miss it -- because they apparently stopped watching pretty early on.  The reason behind the erosion of interest in the show is pretty simple to nail down: It was boring, built around limp writing and clumsily staged attempts at drama.  Granted, no reality show is actually ""real."" But if a producer wants his or her show to draw a reliable base of return viewers, they've got to help those viewers buy into the illusion. That was seldom the case with ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's an upside to it all, it's that the show was not the pox on local culture that many feared. In fact, its New Orleansness seemed to get more and more watered-down with nearly every episode, eventually reduced to little more than Chamber of Commerce images flashed between scenes, with an occasional bowl of gumbo thrown in. That's just as well, given that the show's efforts at including local culture in early episodes was ham-handed at best.  Even then, though, with so few people watching, it's hard to get too terribly worked up about it. As they say: No harm, no foul.  For those few who did watch regularly, producers were kind enough to wrap up most of the show's loose narrative threads in Sunday's finale. Below find a recap of the high points (and low points) of the Season 1 finale of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  The title: ""Better Late Than Pregnant.""  The centerpiece drama of the week: In what was perhaps the show's cheapest stunt yet -- and its most manufactured -- producers pulled a full-on okey-doke on viewers, in the form of a pregnancy scare for cast member Reagan Charleston.  That particular plot point was teased during the closing moments of the previous episode, but before getting to it in Episode 8, producers had hubby Jeff Charleston express his eagerness to become a father -- followed by Raegan informing him that she's not quite ready yet to be a mom. The next thing we know, her period is conveniently late.  So, she does what anybody would do: She takes a pregnancy test. At a huge season-ending party thrown by fellow cast member Jon Moody. And using a pregnancy test that was a gag gift at an adult Easter egg hunt from Episode 7.  And after all that? Spoiler alert: She ain't preggers.  That's right, ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" fans. You just got punk'd.  In all honestly, it's probably for the best, as on Monday (June 4) -- the day after the finale aired -- Reagan and Jeff announced they are separating.  The libation of the week: A French 75, ordered at breakfast by Tamica Lee.  The New Orleans cliche of the week: From a practical standpoint, the idea of throwing a party to end the season was a pretty good one, giving producers the opportunity to get everybody together one last time -- and decked out in their Sunday best -- to wrap up the season's myriad dramas.  That being said, it's nothing short of shameless that they framed it as a ""Jazz Fest launch party."" The show, and the episode has nothing to do with Jazz Fest. The cast never went to Jazz Fest. In fact, music has played a minor role in the series at best.  The honest question of the week: Speaking of the show's lack of focus on music, why didn't producers pick a local musician or two when they were casting the show? Not only would they have gotten some great music out of it, but the real behind-the-scenes dramas that play out on the local music scene have got to be better than the fake ones that played out on Season 1 of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's one thing that could get me interested in a second season, that would probably be it.  The real moment of the week: Of all the lose threads tied up in the season finale, easily the most touching was the reconciliation between cast member Tamica Lee and her daughter, third-grader Rani, with whom she butted heads in a previous episode -- and who has struggled with the fact that she's the only black kid at her school.  After sitting down for a heart-to-heart with the help of supporting cast member Susan Henry, Tamica and Rani hugged it out -- and cried it out -- in what was probably the sweetest moment of the season.  Granted, it all happened during a staged radio interview at local station WBOK, but this is one case where the end justifies the means. On a related note: If there's an MVP of the season, it's Rani, as far as I'm concerned.  The manufactured moment of the week: Raegan's pregnancy scare. (See ""The centerpiece drama,"" above.)  The quote of the week: ""We're just having some conversations."" -- Justin, to mother Dottie Reese, after she walked in on a heated conversation between Justin and girlfriend Kelsey.  I don't know why, but that line cracked me up. In fact, it's not just the quote of the week. It might be the quote of the whole season. I'm think I'm going to start using it whenever anybody butts into a conversation I'm having with somebody else.  Them: ""What are you guys talking about?""  Me: ""We're just having some conversations."" (Exits.)  The winner: The King Firm, where cast member Justin Reese's day job is. Every episode this season, they've bought airtime during the show for a commercial that prominently features Justin -- and which never fails to fool me into thinking the show is back on, thus prompting me to stop fast-forwarding through the commercials.  Granted, I start fast-forwarding again immediately upon realizing it's a commercial, but I know the firm's name now, whereas I didn't' before.  Nicely played, King Firm. Nicely played.  The loser: Me, for actually sitting through all eight episodes.  On the plus side, it's all been documented through the following stories, so future generations can remember the season that was.  As for me, I'm going to start trying to forget it, starting now.

The cast of the 2016 Warner Bros. film famously (or perhaps infamously) got matching ""SKWAD"" tattoos to commemorate their work together. But now Kinnaman thinks that may have been a bad idea.  Kinnaman was all smiles in a 2015 photo that captured Smith at work (although in the caption, the actor acknowledged, ""Will has many many talents, tattooing is not one of them""). But when asked on Watch What Happens Live, he acknowledged he regretted the tattoo: ""The answer is yes. Absolutely. That was a horrible idea.""  ""You know, don't let a 47-year-old man without his reading glasses tattoo you,"" Kinnaman added ""That is the life lesson.""  Despite that regret, he admitted he received exactly what he asked for in the end. ""It's supposed to be a shitty tattoo,"" he said, ""so that's what it is.""  Suicide Squad 2 is expected to see return Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg, Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto as The Joker and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. No release date has been announced, but the film is believed to begin production this fall.  (via MTV)  Venom Producer Identifies the Scene Where the Film Clicked",0

"Wolf writes that Jolie is a feminist superhero who actually has it all. And not in the Carrie Bradshaw sense (you know—sex, shoes, fashion, NYC, girls' night out!, cosmos); rather, admired for her sexuality as much as for being a good person and mom.  Examples please, Ms. Wolf:  1. It all started with her early roles like Girl, Interrupted and Tomb Raider, which established her as ""sexy and daring, confrontational and independent."" That set the stage for everything else.  2. Then she adopted Maddox. ""Suddenly, she seemed more mature, more beautiful, and more serious"" and made single motherhood look awesome. ""She was reframing single motherhood from a state of lack or insufficiency to a glamorous, unfettered lifestyle choice,"" Wolf suggests.  3. She learned to fly a plane, which is the ""ultimate in single-mom chic."" Also, Wolf points out that flying a plane is typically a man thing, so Angie is metaphorically making her own decisions without the help of men. Girl power!  4. Then she chose the most perfect man who ever existed and didn't care about whether he was married. Yes, this makes her a homewrecker. But Wolf argues that Brad Pitt looked so good with the kids as the ultimate male role model that Angie was able to get away with it unscarred.  5. Taking Brad as her lover was also Angie's big ef you to society and rules (like don't steal people's spouses). Break it down, Wolf-style: ""Jolie's evident disdain of that social constraint certainly, for better or worse, put her in the same self-entitled category as those men who have traditionally taken what they wanted and let the emotional chips fall where they may.""  6. And finally, by visiting Afghan refugees in Pakistan and penning op-eds about Darfur in Time, Angelina makes other female stars look lazy with their silly tanning and partying.  And so, Angie is the ""ego ideal"" for ladies. They can live out the fantasy of achieving ultimate single-mom chic, taking the sexiest married man alive as their lover (consequence free), building a small multi-ethnic baby army and solving the world's injustices—while still being desired sexually throughout it all.

"Actress Janina Gavankar reveals the cutest detail of Prince Harry and Meghan's exclusive wedding reception By Clare Douglas  Details about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle'sexclusive nighttime reception following their royal wedding have been the couple's best-kept secret… until now. The bride’s close friend Janina Gavankar was one of 200 guests to score an invite to the bash and has since revealed some of her favourite highlights from the evening.

Speaking to Town and Country, the former True Blood star let slip a few secrets, including the adorable nod the couple paid to their homelands. Each table was named after a food that is pronounced differently in the UK than in the U.S. ""Potato, potato, tomato, tomato, oregano, oregano,"" explained Janina, adding that it was one of many “nods to the beautiful mashup of two cultures."" Another moment the 37-year-old will not soon forget is the touching speech Prince Harry delivered to his new wife. “The speech was so funny, self deprecating, filled with love, and that guy just has her back.

"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s love story plays out on the small screen in Lifetime’s Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, which premieres on Sunday night.  From their first blind date to their cozy kitchen engagement, the TV movie captured many of the couple’s milestone moments — and Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser’s uncanny resemblance to the real-life couple is worth a double take!  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  But what was real and what was just for show? Here’s a breakdown of the show’s major plot points. And, it goes without saying, spoilers ahead!  RELATED: Download PEOPLE’s The Story of Diana for intimate details, interviews with family and friends and exclusive home footage of Prince Harry and Prince William’s late mother  True: Prince Charles Took William and Harry to Africa After Their Mother’s Death  The first scene opens with brothers Prince William and Prince Harry traveling through Africa with their father, Prince Charles, just after Princess Diana’s death. In real life, Charles brought his sons there to escape the glare of the spotlight following their mother’s death on August 30, 1997. It was a formative trip for Harry, who fell in love with Africa during that time. “I first came in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags — we were going to Africa to get away from it all,” Harry told Town & Country in 2017. “This is where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world. I wish I could spend more time in Africa. I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here.”  Prince Philip, Prince William, Earl Spencer, Prince Harry and Prince Charles walk outside Westminster Abbey during the funeral service for Princess Diana JEFF J. MITCHELL/AFP/Getty  False: Prince Harry Was Deep Into the Party Scene Just Before Meeting Meghan  While it’s true that he was known as the party prince during his 20s, his partying days were well behind him by the time he met Meghan in 2016. In 2005, Harry’s picture was splashed on front pages around the world showing the then-20-year-old wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party. He made headlines again after naked photos emerged from his strip billiards game in Las Vegas in 2012. But after retiring from the Army in 2015 after 10 years of service, Harry had reformed his wild ways. And he was ready to find love and settle down. “Harry’s drinking days are over,” a source told PEOPLE. “All of his best friends have settled and had children, so he’s had fewer people to go out and play with. He realized he was getting a bit older and that it was time to settle down a little bit.” Adds Duncan Larcombe, a former royals reporter who traveled with Prince Harry throughout much of the early 2000s: “He desperately wanted to get married and be happy. He sees his brother has found that. The fact that Meghan arrived when she did completes it for Harry.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Owen Humphreys/PA Wire/AP  True: Meghan Took Issue with an Ivory Soap Commercial  The scene where Meghan was offended by a soap commercial geared towards women rings true. Meghan was inspired to change a TV commercial at the age of 11, after seeing a Procter & Gamble commercial that advertised its Ivory dishwashing soap solely to women. The commercial for the soap struck her as unfair and insensitive when she heard, “women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.” Meghan’s social studies class had been assigned to watch commercials and assess them. The assignment led to a monumental moment for the future royal. Meghan decided to write to the company and asked them to change their slogan from “Women all over America” to “People all over America.” And her efforts paid off. The commercial aired on TV again, this time with the slogan, “People are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory care.” About 20 years after seeing the commercial, Meghan gave a speech about the moment at the United Nations, saying, “I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt. It just wasn’t right and something needed to be done.  RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan Confirm They Will Uphold a ‘Very Important’ Tradition Involving the Wedding Dress!  True: Meghan and Harry Were Set Up on a Blind Date  The newly-engaged couple revealed that they were set up on a blind date in July 2016 and knew very little about each other before they met. “It was definitely a set-up — it was a blind date,” Harry said during the couple’s revealing engagement interview. “It was a blind date for sure.” And as is shown in the movie, Meghan did ask their matchmaker whether Harry was “nice.” “I didn’t know much about him. And so the only thing that I had asked her when said she wanted to set us up was – I had one question, I said, ‘Well, is he nice?’ Because if he wasn’t kind it just didn’t – it didn’t seem like it would make sense,” Meghan said during their interview.  True: One of Their First Dates Was a Trip to Botswana  Unlike what was depicted in the movie, Meghan didn’t spend three days waiting for Harry to call her. In real life, Meghan and Harry’s first date was quickly followed by two back-to-back dates in London, so he was already on speed-dial by that point! But after those initial dates, they did travel together to Botswana. “It was I think about three, maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana,” Harry said of their whirlwind romance. “And we camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. So then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to know each other.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Prince Harry in Botswana Rhino Conservation Botswana/ Kensington Palace/Getty  False: Will and Kate Cautioned Harry About Dating Meghan  In the movie, Prince William and Kate Middleton aren’t overly supportive of Harry dating Meghan in the beginning and they express their concern over her background. But Meghan’s future in-laws have always been in the couple’s corner. “She’s been wonderful,” Meghan said of Kate after the couple’s engagement. Harry added: “Amazing, as has William as well, you know, fantastic support.” Meghan, who will be learning on the job, “is funny and serious and extremely hard-working,” a source close to the former Suits star told PEOPLE. “I can imagine Kate will find a great friend in her.”  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  False: Meghan Wasn’t Invited to Pippa Middleton’s Wedding Reception  While it’s true that Meghan didn’t receive an invite to Pippa’s wedding ceremony, she was invited to the black-tie reception that followed. Following the ceremony, a source told PEOPLE that Harry would travel back to London to pick Meghan up for the wedding reception in Bucklebury. The royal was spotted driving after the post-church Englefield House party. The fact that she did attend the wedding — even if it was the post-church nighttime bash — was yet another sign that the Suits actress and the prince were getting more and more serious.  True: A Royal Relative Wore an Offensive Brooch  While it didn’t happen at Pippa’s wedding as depicted in the movie, a royal relative did wear an offensive brooch to the Queen’s annual Christmas lunch, which was attended by Meghan in December 2017. Princess Michael of Kent, the wife of the Queen’s first cousin, was pictured arriving at Buckingham Palace wearing a brooch on her left shoulder which appeared to be “blackamoor” jewelry, depicting the bust of a black person with a gold crown and colorful crystals. The brooch drew further criticism due to Meghan’s biracial background (her mother is Black and her father is white) — and the fact that Princess Michael chose to wear it on the day Meghan was being introduced to many extended royal family members for the first time. Princess Michael of Kent released a statement following the incident that read: “The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.”  Princess Michael of Kent Mark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty  True: Harry and Meghan Wore Matching Bracelets  Just like in the movie, Harry did give Meghan a bracelet that matched his own. The couple started sporting “his and hers” jewelry early on in their relationship. They were spotted wearing the same blue beaded bracelet on several occasions. Prince Harry reportedly picked up the bracelet during one of his trips to Africa. And the gift rarely left the actress’s wrist! She even posted several photos on her now-deleted Instagram account showing off her sweet trinket.  Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty; Megan Markle/Instagram  True: Meghan Met the Queen  During Meghan and Prince Harry’s revealing engagement interview, the couple revealed that the L.A.-born actress had not only met the Queen a couple times already, she also immediately won over her dogs. “It’s incredible,” Meghan said about meeting the Queen. “To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as Monarch, but with the love he has for her as his grandmother. She’s an incredible woman.” Harry then added: “The corgis took to her straight away. ‘I’ve spent the last 33 years being barked at — this one walks in, absolutely nothing.” And Meghan, who has two dogs herself, replied: “They were laying on my feet during tea!”  False: Harry’s Public Statement Led to a Breakup  While the movie insinuates that Meghan was in the dark about Harry’s rare public statement in November 2016 that confirmed that he was dating the actress and slammed what he called the racist and sexist abuse she had endured since their relationship was revealed, Meghan was most likely fully supportive of that decision. And it didn’t lead to a brief breakup as was depicted in the movie. Since it was such a rare move for a royal family member to release a statement about their private life, Meghan would have been briefed about the statement at length before it was released.  Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance Lifetime  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Alexi Lubomirski/REX/Shutterstock  False: A Member of Harry’s Inner Circle Tried to Intimidate Meghan  The character of Annabella, played by Marlie Collins, doesn’t exist in real life. But the royal interloper, who chided Meghan about her TV career, biracial background and even her biological clock, did represent a lot of the criticism the couple was facing when they took their relationship public.  True: Meghan’s Ex-Husband Is Producing a Show Based on Her Relationship with Prince Harry  Trevor Engelson, Meghan’s ex-husband, is producing an as-of-yet-untitled show with a premise that sounds awfully familiar — because it’s based on his own relationship with Meghan, and her relationship with Prince Harry. The description of the show reads: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level,” according to Deadline. The idea came to be during a discussion between Engelson — who also works on FX’s Snowfall — and Dan Farah, another one of the show’s producers, where they imagined what life would have been like if Engelson and Markle had children, and he potentially had to share custody (and all the associated drama) with the royal family. Though the basis of the show was hatched from reality, Deadline does add that, “It should be noted that the comedy is fictional, the lead characters are not based on Markle or Engelson, who have no kids together, and she has had no involvement in the project.”  Queen Charlotte Indianapolis Museum of Art /Getty Images  True: Meghan Is Not the First Biracial Royal  Although it’s doubtful that the Queen showed Meghan a portrait of Queen Charlotte, a biracial royal, during her palace visit, she is, in fact, a real royal. Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was married to King George III and was queen for nearly 60 years, until she died in 1818. She’s the grandmother of Queen Victoria and the great-great-great-great-grandmother of the current Queen Elizabeth. Though she was born in Germany, the daughter of a Duke, Queen Charlotte was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, which was the black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. Her racial background wasn’t known to the public when she served as queen. It was only discovered many years after her death, thanks to art historians who studied portraits of Charlotte more closely.",0

"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez’s rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper’s decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren’t seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez’s shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt “tied down” in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we’re told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was “heartbroken” over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a “love triangle” with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn’t caused by the “Love Yourself” singer.

"Kendall Jenner is taking a cue from Jamie Foxx and blaming it on the alcohol.  Ellen DeGeneres grilled Jenner when the reality star appeared on her talk show, asking her about her discreet tattoos. Turns out, she wasn’t exactly clearheaded while deciding to get inked on her inner lip back in July 2016.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Before carefully exposing the hidden tattoo (Jenner took pains not smudge her statement lipstick), the model told DeGeneres, “I was drunk! I was not thinking clearly.”  The host also inquired about the 22-year-old’s choice of phrase: the word “meow.”  “It was literally the first thing that came to my mind,” she explained. “I don’t know, just my drunk thoughts.”  Despite DeGeneres’ hesitation, Jenner noted that the location of her tattoo minimalized the pain. The body art done on her fingers where there’s bone, however, hurt a bit, Jenner said.  The talk show star examined the tattoos on Jenner’s fingers, a heart and a dot, done in white ink to be inconspicuous.  “I just wanted to know what it felt like,” Jenner explained when asked why she would elect to have barely visible artwork done. “All my friends have them. I was like, ‘I just want to know what it feels like.’ “  Kendall Jenner JonBoy Tattoo/Instagram  Unlike many who get tattoos with special significance, the model previously wrote on her website that her inner lip ink was just for fun — despite older sister Kim Kardashian West’s advice to never “put a bumper sticker on a Bentley.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kendall Jenner Opens Up About Her Golden Globes Acne: ‘Never Let That S— Stop You!’  “There’s no real meaning behind it, I just wanted to be able to say that I have a tattoo ‘on my face,’ ” she said. “I have two others also: a broken heart on one hand and a full heart on the other.”  Jenner continued, “I definitely want more and even though I used to say I’d only get one if it meant something to me, now I have even more possibilities!”",0

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption As a New York City mayoral candidate, Anthony Weiner confronts a heckler  Acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon H Kim said in a statement that Weiner ""asked a girl who he knew to be 15 years old to display her naked body and engage in sexually explicit behaviour for him online"".  ""Justice demands that this type of conduct be prosecuted and punished with time in prison.""  In addition to jail time, Weiner was sentenced to three years of supervised release, according to a statement from the US Attorney's Office.  Weiner's lawyers contended the former politician had acted out of the ""depths of an uncontrolled sickness"" and was now seeking treatment.  In a letter to Judge Cote, Weiner said he felt ""profound"" regret for his crimes and that his misconduct had ""crushed the aspirations"" of his wife, Huma Abedin, and ruined their marriage.  Ms Abedin filed for divorce on the same day as her husband was found guilty in May.  She did not attend the sentencing, but asked for leniency on their son's behalf in a letter to the judge.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Anthony Weiner (L) and Huma Abedin split last year  The FBI began investigating Weiner last September after the Daily Mail reported that he had exchanged obscene messages with a North Carolina teenager.  The 15-year-old girl said he had asked her to undress on camera.  A month earlier, Ms Abedin announced she was separating from her husband after it emerged he sent a photo of himself in his underpants with his toddler son nearby.  The New York Post reported that Weiner had sent sexual messages along with the photo to an unidentified woman in 2015.  Once a rising Democratic star, he stepped down from Congress in June 2011 after a graphic image sent from his Twitter account went public.  Initially claiming his account was hacked, he eventually confessed to having lied.  Weiner also admitted indulging in explicit online exchanges with at least six other women and pledged to seek therapy.  He tried to revive his political career in 2013 by running for mayor of New York.  But his campaign imploded amid reports of further graphic online messages.  The investigation into Weiner's sexting case played a role in last year's 2016 presidential election, when authorities found emails on his laptop from Ms Abedin, who was a senior aide to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  A separate FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's private use of email while she was secretary of state was closed after officials said nothing incriminating was found.",0
"In a documentary set to air tomorrow, royal expert Katie Nicholl reveals that the smitten prince described the Suits star as his “ideal girl” two years before they met last year. She said: “He had a crush on Rachel Zane two years before he met Meghan and the reason I know is because I was having drinks with one of his friends. “She told me she’d been on a night out with Prince Harry. He was single at the time, so she said, ‘Harry, who’s your ideal girl?’ And he said ‘Meghan Markle from Suits.’” Prince Harry is said to have organised a meeting with his dream woman after having asked mutual friend Markus Anderson, a close friend of the divorcee, to set up a meeting between the two in order to fulfil his Rachel Zane fantasies.  GETTY The smitten couple struggled to keep their hands off each other during their latest appearance  The meeting reportedly took place when the 36-year-old was in London in July last year to watch Serena Williams play tennis at Wimbledon. According to The Sun, Ms Nicholl's added: “He asked Markus if he could set up, not a date, but an opportunity for them to meet and that happened in one of the private rooms of Soho House. “There were about seven or eight of them altogether and it was a perfect opportunity for Harry and Meghan to come together in a really informal environment and actually talk. “She was funny, feisty, confident and she wasn’t swayed or knocked by the fact that he was Prince Harry. She thought he was terribly cute.”  Prince Harry's girlfriend Meghan Markle Sun, September 24, 2017 Prince Harry confirms he is in a relationship with model and actress Meghan Markle Play slideshow Getty 1 of 40 Meghan Markle attends the Invictus Games Toronto 2017  The royal expert revealed that after the pair’s first meeting, Prince Harry described the Suits star as a “cracking girl”.

"At an intimate show in his hometown of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, February 9, Blake Shelton offered the crowd plenty of their favorites — including his girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. “Gwen sat in the stands and was grooving along,” a concert-goer says in the new issue of Us Weekly. “Blake sang a lot in her direction.” At one point, he even shared a sweet detail of their home life, says the witness: “Their dog was having puppies and they couldn’t wait to get home!”  For now, those furry family members are serving as surrogates of sorts. “Blake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold,” an insider shares in the new issue. “Their feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they’ve decided to not focus on it for the time being.”  Stefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals. But the one blessing of their struggle is that it’s made them stronger than ever. The source says Shelton is “absolutely devoted” to Gwen’s sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4: “Blake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys.”  Shelton’s devotion is part of what made the couple try for a child together. “Blake has always wanted children,” explains a friend. “And he’s great with Gwen’s kids, which prompted them wanting their own.”  The No Doubt singer was all in — but not anymore. “Not because of a change in her love for Blake,” explains the source, “but because she feels as if it might not be meant to be.” The country star is on board with her thoughts. “He is completely at peace with the prospect of not having any biological children of his own,” shares the insider.  With no baby, they’ve also put their wedding plans on hold. Says the source, “Gwen is very traditional and wouldn’t want to be pregnant without being married.”  Still, things are hardly cooling off for the Voice coaches. “Their relationship has grown and matured into a stable, loving union,” explains the source. “The need to get married and have kids isn’t the priority it once was.”  When the duo first announced they were dating in November 2015, they were both going through emotional divorces. Stefani split from the father of her boys, Gavin Rossdale, after being married for 13 years, and Shelton had recently ended his four-year union with Miranda Lambert.  Now, the pair have settled in to an “easy, effortless love” together, says the source. That includes spending plenty of time on Shelton’s Oklahoma ranch — something the glamour girl surprisingly adores! Another favorite activity? “Gwen loves hanging out with Blake’s friends and wives,” says the source. The low-key loves enjoyed a couples’ trip with pals in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, this January.

"Just as important as the Met Gala theme reveal—next year’s show is titled “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination”—is the announcement of Anna Wintour’s cohosts. Taking over the duties carried out last time around by Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, Gisele Bündchen, and Tom Brady are three women who are as talented as they are glamorous: Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace.  The big question, of course, is what will they wear? While we count down to the big night—May 7, 2018—we look back at each woman’s personal Met Gala history searching for clues.  Amal Clooney  Met Gala Debut: 2015  Galas Attended: 1  Clooney made a stunning party-of-the-year debut in a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal gown by John Galliano. Its deep red color was presumably a nod to the exhibition’s theme, “China: Through the Looking Glass,” but this dress was an homage to the wearer. Strapless with a corset-like top, its skirt flared slightly in a cascade of tiers creating the narrow, figure-flattering silhouette Clooney prefers.  Advertisement 1 / 7  Rihanna  Met Gala Debut: 2007  Galas Attended: 7  Gala Performances: 2  Rihanna is a Met Gala all-star: No one gets more into the spirit of things than @badgalriri. Consider the yolk-color Guo Pei gown she wore to the 2015 event that not only put the Chinese designer on the map, but also blew up the memosphere. For anyone other than Rihanna, that look would have been a tough one to top, but she managed, arriving at this year’s Comme des Garçons exhibition in a fresh-off-the-runway look by the woman of the hour, Rei Kawakubo. By now, we know to expect the unexpected from Rihanna—even an impromptu performance, like the one she gave with Kanye West in 2009.  Advertisement 1 / 16  Donatella Versace  Met Gala Debut (on record): 1995  Galas Attended: 16  In 1997, the Costume Institute remembered Gianni Versace’s life and work with an exhibition. This year, to mark the 20th anniversary of her brother’s death, Donatella Versace presented a tribute collection to her brother for Spring 2018. Next May, she’ll cohost the gala that she used to attend by his side. While we know what Donatella will wear—one of her own glamorous creations, cierto—precisely which A-listers will form her entourage remains to be seen.

Someone's looking hawt after their post-break-up make-over!  Gone are the bad jeans and the 'Mummy tops'. Newly-single Katie Holmes had a whole new look when she went out for dinner last night.  And we like it!    Wearing a sexy black leather jacket and an elegant green maxi-dress, all glammed up with a boxy clutch-bag, Katie looked the best we've seen her for ages.  Single life obviously suits her.  Katie met her mystery friend for dinner at trendy restaurant Nomad in New York.  And even gave him a peck on the cheek as he put her in a taxi at the end of the night.  He was wearing a wedding ring though, so we're guessing they're just mates.  But still, it's nice to get taken out for dinner and stuff.  (Image: Splash)  (Image: Splash)  (Image: Splash)  It looks like an episode of Sex and The City - and Katie would SO be Charlotte.  Katie was due to make her first red-carpet appearance post-divorce tonight at the Dizzy Feet Foundation gala in LA, but she decided to pull out.  Probably so she could go on more fun date nights in New York.  But if Katie's had a glam-over, six-year-old Suri is taking a back-seat in the fashion stakes.  She took a break from the designer frocks and heels and went out in, um, a blanket the other day.  You can read about that here if you so wish.",0

PHOTOS: Kristen cheats on Rob -- see the crazy pics!  ""S— happens, you know?"" Pattinson, 28, told the magazine with a laugh. ""It's just young people… it’s normal! And honestly, who gives a s—?""  The British actor's latest comments come two years after Us Weekly exclusively revealed Stewart's fling with her married Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders in shocking pics published in July 2012.  PHOTOS: Biggest cheating scandals ever  ""The hardest part was talking about it afterwards,"" Pattinson said of the affair. ""Because when you talk about other people, it affects them in ways you can't predict.""

"Story highlights Brown deleted her account Wednesday  She's the latest celeb to be cyberbullied  (CNN) Millie Bobby Brown has deactivated her Twitter account after becoming the target of a cruel hashtag and meme.  The 14 year-old ""Stranger Things"" star deleted her @milliebbrown account Wednesday.

"© Provided by Bang Priyanka Chopra spent Fourth of July with her boyfriend Nick Jonas and his family in New York City.  Priyanka Chopra celebrated Fourth of July with Nick Jonas' relatives in New York.  The 35-year-old actress is said to be dating the 'Jealous' hitmaker and it looks like she's had no problems settling into his tight-knit family as she arranged a bike ride with her beau, his brother Joe Jonas and his fiancée Sophie Turner on the Upper West Side of the city on Independence Day earlier this week.  A source told E! News: ''Joe and Sophie rode faster with a pack of friends, while Nick and Priyanka were in the back. They seemed very touchy feely.''  The brunette beauty then joined Nick's whole family - including his brother Kevin Jonas, sister-in-law Danielle Jonas, and nieces Alena and Valentina - in the evening on a private roof terrace to watch the fireworks.  This isn't the first time the 'Quantico' actress has been involved in Nick's family celebrations as she was also invited to his cousin's wedding in New Jersey last month.  An insider explained: ''It's a huge deal that Nick brought Priyanka to his cousin's wedding. He's dated a lot over the last couple years but it's never been anything serious, so this is a big step. Nick and Priyanka really like each other, and his family enjoyed getting to know her as well. She fit right in!''  Although things seem to be heating up between her and the 25-year-old singer, Priyanka still doesn't seem keen on getting married in the future.

"Trey Songz can rest a little easier, as he apparently will not be facing felony prosecution for his alleged beating of Andrea Buera in a nightclub over NBA All-Star Weekend.  According to TMZ, the L.A. District attorney wasn't convinced about the validity of the case, leading to the felony charges being dropped against the singer.  Songz's lawyer reportedly presented several eye-witness statements that contradicted the statements given by Buera, as well as other info damaging to Buera's credibility.  The assault was first reported back in February, with Buera giving a press conference with her side of the story in early March, where she claimed that he beat her so badly that she had to be sent to the hospital. She also confirmed that she had received a temporary restraining order against Songz. Since then, Songz was forced to turn himself in to police, and was released from jail on a $50,000 bond. In his sole statement on the situation, Songz claimed that he was ""being lied on and falsely accused for someone's personal gain.""  Despite gaining support from other artists such as 50 Cent, who called the accusations a ""money play,"" Songz still has several accusations against him from multiple women.  However, in this instance it appears he's gotten off easy. Songz still isn't off the hook yet, as his case is now being referred to the L.A. City Attorney, who can still charge him with the lesser crime of misdemeanor domestic violence.  We'll keep you up to date with any more news about the case.",1

"Following the cancellation of his tour, rumour has now spread that Justin Bieber may be planning to start up his own church.  Last night saw Bieber cancel his world ‘Purpose’ tour, months before it was due to end – citing claiming to be ‘burned out’ and exhausted from the months on the road.  Now, sources claim that Bieber may be turning his attention to ‘reconnecting with his faith’ and starting up his own church.  “I am led to believe that the real reason he has come off the road is because he wants to reconnect with his faith and he may be even planning to start his own church,” celebrity journalist Richard Wilkins told Today Extra – after speaking to sources close to him at the annual Hillsong Church Conference in Sydney.  “We know that he was in the country a few weeks ago having meetings and attending the big Hillsong convention that they had here. [He’s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he’s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own – starting his own church – we’re not quite sure, but that’s the word from an inside source.”  Apologising to his fans via TMZ for cancelling his upcoming shows, Bieber said: “I love you guys, I think you guys are awesome. Sorry for anyone who feels disappointed or betrayed, it’s not in my heart [or] anything, and have a blessed day.”",1
"Gus Kenworthy announced on Saturday, May 26, that his dog Beemo died of a heart defect. The Team USA athlete adopted Beemo from a dog farm during the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, earlier this year.  “Two days ago my beautiful baby Beemo passed away,” Kenworthy captioned an Instagram photo showing the pup licking his ear. “It was completely unexpected and Matt [Wilkas] and I are beside ourselves trying to cope with her loss. For a week or so we’d been worrying because she was showing less and less interest in her food. There were several trips to the vet and on our final visit this past Thursday I asked them do a full body scan in case there was an underlying issue they had missed. Beemo went into a panic attack during the x-rays and her breathing became rapid and shallow. The scan revealed that her lungs were deteriorated and that her heart was too big for her body – a birth defect we had no way of knowing about.”  Kenworthy rushed her from that vet, who was unable to treat her, to an emergency vet where she was placed on a respirator in the hope “they could get her vitals back to a normal level so she could be treated but they were never able to do so.”  The athlete wrote that the days since losing Beemo have been “a blur.”  “It all happened so fast that it’s still hard to believe it,” he continued. “The ER doc told us that even if we’d somehow spotted the issue earlier it wouldn’t have made a difference in the end. He said that she’d been living on ‘borrowed time’ from the get go. Beemo was truly the best thing that ever happened to me and I feel so fortunate for our borrowed time together. I’ve never loved anything or anyone in the way that I loved that dog and she is and will always be deeply missed.  “She was so smart and playful. She brought so much happiness to so many people every single day. I’ll always remember being out on a walk with her and every other second she would get stopped by someone wanting to pet her, kneel down and kiss her, hold her in their arms or take a photo and on many occasions a crowd of people would have formed around her. That was her power: she made people smile,” Kenworthy concluded. “She was the kindest, most gentle soul I’ve ever known. She loved people. She loved birds and the snow. She loved me and Matt. But most of all she loved meeting other dogs. If any of you have pets up in doggy heaven please tell them to go find Bee because she could really use a good play date right now. RIP sweet creature – your daddy loves you more than you could ever even know!”  Kenworthy and his boyfriend, Matthew Wilkas, announced in February that they had fallen for the puppy at first sight and planned to take her home after the games.  “This morning Matt and I had a heart-wrenching visit to one of the 17,000 dog farms here in South Korea. Across the country there are 2.5 million dogs being raised for food in some of the most disturbing conditions imaginable,” the freestyle skier wrote on Instagram at the time. “Yes, there is an argument to be made that eating dogs is a part of Korean culture. And, while don’t personally agree with it, I do agree that it’s not my place to impose western ideals on the people here. The way these animals are being treated, however, is completely inhumane and culture should never be a scapegoat for cruelty.”  A month later, the couple revealed Beemo was finally home with them in the states after she was quarantined. Kenworthy gushed to Us in March about the pup.  “I like human names for dogs. When we were coming up with a name from Beemo, we were going over pop queens and divas,” he said. “But then I kind of just wanted to keep it in the family with her older brother who lives with my ex, so we went with another character which is Beemo.”  Kenworthy frequently shared photos of Beemo on Instagram, and even made a separate account for her, which has over 130k followers. Kenworthy also helped rescue four dogs from the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

The thriller, directed by JC Chandor, will replace the actor and continue without him. No word on what specifically made Affleck drop out, but he is still expected to make an appearance at Comic-Con this week to promote part one of Justice League, out in November.  ET reached out to Affleck's rep for comment.    RELATED: Ben Affleck Arrives Solo to Charity Gala in 1st Red Carpet Appearance Since Lindsay Shookus Romance News    In March, Affleck revealed in an intimate Facebook post that he had completed rehab and was taking the necessary steps for a ""positive recovery.""

"John Bernecker, the stuntman who suffered massive head injuries in a fall Wednesday on the set of The Walking Dead, has died at Atlanta Medical Center.  The death was confirmed to Deadline by Coweta County Coroner Richard Hawk, who said Bernecker died of blunt force trauma at 6:30 PM ET on Wednesday. A source at the hospital told Deadline earlier that Bernecker had been placed on a ventilator while his family made arrangements.  Bernecker’s family has agreed to donate Bernecker’s organs through LifeLink of Georgia, a nonprofit group dedicated to the recovery of organs and tissue for transplantation.  Federal workplace monitor OSHA and SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents stunt performers, have launched investigations into the accident.  It’s believed to be the first stunt-related death in the United States in more than 17 years. AMC said earlier today that it temporarily halted production on Season 8 of the zombie apocalypse series in the wake of the accident.  Sources say Bernecker and an actor were rehearsing a fight scene that was supposed to end with a routine fall from a balcony, but he lost his footing and fell 30 feet to a concrete floor. He was pronounced brain-dead at the hospital and was taken off life support today.  IMDb lists more than 90 stunt credits since 2009 for Bernecker, including the recent features Black Panther, Logan, Get Out, The Fate of the Furious and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2. He also was featured in a 2014 episode of the web series Behind the Stunts. Watch a 2016 reel of Bernecker’s stunt work below.  Stunt work has always been dangerous, but less so now than ever before, said veteran stuntman Conrad Palmisano, a member of the SAG-AFTRA stunt and safety committee. “Generally, it’s safer now that it was 20 years ago, and I anticipate it being safer 20 years from now than it was today,” he told Deadline. “But it’s still a dangerous business. The nature of stunts is inherently dangerous, and we work very hard to create stunts in the safest possible manner. However, it’s still dangerous and things can go wrong. It’s never one thing. Usually the planets have to align in all the wrong ways for something tragically to go wrong. When we as a stunt community examine what happened, we look to fix the problem, not to affix the blame.”  Although stunt deaths have become rare in the U.S., falls have proved particularly deadly in the past. In 2000, Brady Michaels was killed while filming the UPN reality show I Dare You when he fell from a stationary train during rehearsals in Arizona and struck his head on a rock.  In 1996, Paul Dallas died of head injuries in a fall on the set of the TV series L.A. Heat. He fell 57 feet from a power plant platform and landed on the airbag that was supposed to break his fall but was ejected backward and hit his head on a metal railing.  Two years earlier, stuntwoman Sonja Davis was killed in a high fall on the set of the film A Vampire in Brooklyn. Jumping from a rooftop, she partially missed the airbag below and struck her head on the pavement.  In 1990, a high fall also took the life of stuntman Jay C. Currin, who was killed in a 60-foot jump from a seaside cliff in Malibu on the first day of filming Bikini Island. Landing on the edge of the airbag, he was thrown into the rocks along the beach.  In 1981, Jack Tyree was killed when he jumped off an 80-foot cliff in Malibu and missed his airbag while filming The Sword and the Sorcerer.  Three years earlier, stuntman A.J. Bakunas was killed on the set of the movie Steel while attempting to set a world record by jumping without a parachute from the 22nd floor of a construction site in downtown Lexington, KY. A canvas and plastic airbag intended to cushion his fall split open upon impact. He’d set a world record for a 230-foot jump the year before on Hooper and was killed while attempting to retake the record from Dar Robinson, who’d made a 296-foot high-fall. Directed by stunt legend Hal Needham, Hooper starred Burt Reynolds as an aging Hollywood stuntman who tries to keep ahead of the new kid on the block (Jan-Michael Vincent).

"That’s one way to spread cheer! Harry Styles gave James Corden a kiss during a Christmas-themed “Carpool Karaoke” segment on The Late Late Show on Monday, December 11.  The late-night host, 39, enlisted several of his Carpool Karaoke guests from the past year — including Pink, Miley Cyrus, Bruno Mars, Sam Smith, Kelly Clarkson and Fifth Harmony — to sing a fun-filled rendition of the Christmas classic “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town.”  The holiday sketch kicked off with Corden and musician Reggie Watts, who leads the Late Late Show’s house band, cruising around Los Angeles. “The great thing about this time of year is I feel like it’s the only time we’re not judged for driving to work dressed like this,” quipped the British star, who was clad in a red Santa hat and a Christmas sweater.  After singing the tune with his many guests, Corden turned to Styles, 23, and said, “Happy Christmas, Harold.” The former One Direction singer initially stayed silent but smirked slightly. He then leaned in to kiss Corden on the lips, placing one of his hands on the comedian’s cheek and wrapping the other around his head.  “Wow, I did not expect that for Christmas,” the TV personality said with a laugh.  This isn’t the first time the fellow Brits have locked lips. During a 2013 episode of the U.K. game show A League of Their Own, the “Kiwi” singer gave Corden a lengthy smooch on the lips during a scripted kiss cam segment.

"That report seemed to open the floodgates. Next, The Shade Room published more photos and videos of Thompson entering his hotel with a woman and showed her later leaving a large bag.  Finally, TMZ unearthed security shots taken in a hookah room in Washington DC last October. It showed that Thompson was approaching two women.  Neither the 33-year-old reality star, who called his 20-month romance with Thompson his ""best"" union, nor the NBA champion have commented on the reports, but privately, a source tells E ! News: ""She feels defeated."" Fortunately, she has her best cheerleaders by her side. Mama Kris Jenner of 62 years, and sisters Kourtney of 38 years, and Kim of 37 years, have joined her, says another source: ""They wanted that was comfortable and not stressed at all. """,1
"First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.",1
"Johnny Depp surprised Disneyland park-goers Wednesday evening when he dressed up as Captain Jack Sparrow aboard the “Pirates of the Caribbean” ride.  Instead of the usual animatronic in Depp’s likeness, visitors were treated to the actual actor reciting lines from the popular film franchise while brandishing his sword at the Anaheim, California, theme park.  This is not the first time Depp has stopped by the ride that inspired 2003’s “Curse of the Black Pearl,” but this is his first appearance during the “Dead Men Tell No Tales” era of his iconic captain’s log.  Some lucky riders were able to capture footage of Depp getting into character on social media.  Life is complete!

The stunt comes just a month before “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” sails into theaters May 26.  The fifth installment of Disney’s swashbuckling franchise will see a departure from 2011’s “On Stranger Tides” in an effort to return to the original film’s feel. Also returning will be Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley in their roles as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who were last seen in 2007’s “At World’s End.”  “Tales” also stars Javier Bardem, Kaya Scodelario, Brenton Thwaites, Kevin McNally, and Geoffrey Rush.",0
"Ryan Gosling is about to star in two of the most anticipated films of recent years. First up in the extraordinary La La Land alongside Emma Stone, which has been receiving rave reviews and huge awards season buzz. Then we'll see him opposite Harrison Ford in Ridley Scott's return to the world of Blade Runner. We know he leaves many of his fans rather breathless and light-headed so we suggest you are sitting as we take a look at his greatest movie moment to date and what makes him so incredible.  GETTY Ryan Gosling is about to star in La La Land and Blade Runner  1. Crazy, Stupid, Love – because he’s a true gent. Gosling’s performance as a bachelor in Crazy, Stupid, Love changes the way we view the world when he instigates the re-enactment of the famous Dirty Dancing Scene with Emma Stone. FUN FACT: Did you know that when shooting the scene, Emma panicked during the lift and accidentally kicked Ryan in the throat? It seems like Ryan is a true gent and didn’t take it to heart as the pair have remained firm friends and went on to work together in Gangster Squad. We can’t wait to see the winning duo reunited again in La La land.  2. The Place Beyond The Pines – because he doesn’t take himself too seriously. Ryan’s electric performance in The Place Beyond the Pines blends toughness and vulnerability as he plays a bank robber determined to provide for his son. FUN FACT: They shot the bank robbery scene using real bank staff and customers. Don’t worry, they were told they were going to be in a movie before the heist took place… What makes us love this on screen moment even more is that Ryan didn’t take himself too seriously; he tells MSN “I think I spotted someone filming me on their camera phone as I robbed the place”.  Ryan Gosling in pictures Tue, November 12, 2013 Here are Ryan Gosling's hottest pictures on and off set for you to feast your eyes on. Play slideshow REUTERS 1 of 30 Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone pose with their Golden Globe awards  3. Drive – because he can hold you captive without saying a word. If you haven’t seen the opening scene of Drive, you’re seriously missing out. Drive is a pulp thriller where Gosling plays a cool stunt driver who secretly works for criminals as a getaway driver. The opening scene is one of the most edge-of-your-seat cinematic moments you’ll experience. Gosling’s character has just picked up his latest comrades from burgling a jewellery store and driving them to safety. The greatest thing about the scene is the suspense. It’s held without any dialogue between the getaway driver and the criminals. All that is heard is the police radio as the police officers try and locate the getaway car.  4. Blue Valentine - because his ukulele performance will melt your heart. Ryan plays a character called Dean in Blue Valentine, which depicts the relationship between him and Cindy played by Michelle Williams. It shows the unravelling of their marriage and flashing back to their courtship. Ryan puts on an endearing performance of “You Always Hurt the One You Love” where he sings and plays the Ukulele whilst Michelle tap dances. FUN FACT: Most people don’t know that both actors were asked to perform a special talent but neither knew what the other would do. So, when the scene played out, the actors discovered each other’s surprising abilities at the same time as the film’s audience.  5. Half Nelson - because he shows his acting skills are as great as his looks. As well as his good looks and dazzling charm, we can’t forget that Ryan can seriously act. A momentous scene takes place in Half Nelson where Ryan plays an inner-city teacher who is found taking crack cocaine in a store cupboard by a young student. FUN FACT: The result of such a performance landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in Leading Role. 6. The Big Short - because he came back. After Ryan announced his break from acting in March 2013, we were all heartbroken. But thankfully he came back and appeared in The Big Short, giving the best explanation of the housing market collapse in America using Jenga. His great performance alongside Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, Christain Bale and Marisa Tomei won six Oscar Nominations for the film.",0
"Kevin Federline wants to triple the $20,000 in monthly child support he receives from Britney Spears.  Federline, 40, claims that Spears’ increased earnings compared with his decreasing income create “an extreme disparity” in their sons’ lifestyles from her home to his, documents obtained by The Blast revealed Tuesday.  Federline alleged in the documents that his work as a DJ nets him less than 1 percent of Spears’ reported $34 million income because he is “less of a name” than he was in 2008 when he took in six figures.  The former backup dancer claims he earns roughly $3,000 per month but that he doesn’t know how much Spears, 36, truly earns because she has allegedly refused to turn over her tax returns or reveal her income.  The couple, who were married from 2004 to 2007, agreed at the time that Spears would make $20,000 monthly child support payments to Federline for sons Sean Preston, 12, and Jayden James, 11. She also gave him $1.3 million at the time of their split.  Spears agreed to the terms through her father, Jamie, who controls her finances through a conservatorship to this day following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007.  Since then, she’s landed two lucrative Las Vegas residencies, gone on tour, released four new albums, five compilation albums, 18 fragrances and a lingerie line.  Federline laments in the documents that “[Spears] is a single woman who lives alone in a 13,264 square foot Neoclassical Italianate villa on 21 acres of land in a gated community with an elevator, a library, a media/game room, 3,500 bottle wine cellar, an additional 1,200 square foot pool house, an orchard, resort-sized pool and spa, lighted tennis court and three-green golf course. In contrast, Respondent lives with his wife, his two minor children from his current marriage, the two minor children he shares with Petitioner and two minor children from a previous relationship in a 2,000 square foot home.”  He claims that Spears (who’s currently dating hunky fitness junkie Sam Asghari) offers the boys amenities including private chefs, tutors, nannies and other staff, as well as the best toys and gadgets available and that he simply can’t keep up with their luxuries in his 2,000-square-foot home, in which his wife Victoria Prince, their two children and his two children from ex-wife Shar Jackson all live.  Federline has previously rejected attempts to settle the child support battle without litigation.  “It’s their position that they don’t have to turn over Britney’s financial information, including tax returns, which is required under the California family code. It’s not California celebrity code edition, she has to comply,” Federline’s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told Us Weekly Tuesday. “This is the choice they have made, and they will now have to deal with it. We are still open to try and settling this without judicial intervention.”  Neither a rep nor an attorney for Spears immediately returned a request for comment.",0
"Brad Pitt may be finding love again, but a source close to him EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that the actor doubts the ‘right guy’ exists for Angelina Jolie. Ouch!  After causing everyone who still believed in true love to shudder collectively after hearing that the two of them were breaking up, Brad Pitt, 53, and Angelina Jolie, 42, still don’t seem to be on the friendliest of terms after their split. A source close to Brad told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Brad doesn’t think a long-lasting love is in the cards for Angelina. “Brad is doubtful Angelina can have a successful marriage after theirs failed. Brad knows first hand how incredibly unique and challenging it is being in Angelina’s family. Brad gave it everything he had and is disappointed they could not stay together,” our source says.  Brad is currently rumored to be dating actress Ella Purnell, 21, but he still has a lot of respect for his ex. The source went on to say, “It is difficult dealing with the media, the fame, career, traveling and everything else that goes with being one of the most powerful women in Hollywood. Brad knows what a dedicated mother Angelina is and how hard that can be for even the strongest men to deal with in a relationship.”  We reported earlier about how Angelina invited Brad to go trick-or-treating with their kids, but that Brad wasn’t “having it” with the prospect of any hangout with his ex. Our source added, “Brad understands that the best, most healthy and lasting relationships need lots of compromise so whoever has a shot at marrying Angelina will need to give up a lot to fit into her challenging lifestyle. Brad feels that while he wishes her the best, after several failed marriages for Angelina, the right guy for her might not exist.” While you muse on whether true love exists or not, check out pics of the celebrity couples who had downright painful breakups.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina will eventually find love again?",1

"The scandal surrounding Bachelor in Paradise isn't over yet.  The lawyer for contestant Corinne Olympios, who was at the center of the alleged misconduct that led to production being suspended on the ABC reality series, is speaking out hours after producer Warner Bros. announced that it had closed its internal investigation into the claim and that production on the current fourth season would resume.  ""It needs to be made crystal clear that production of Bachelor in Paradise was shut down because of multiple complaints received from BIP producers and crewmembers on the set. It was not shut down due to any complaint filed by Corinne against anyone,"" Olympios' lawyer, Martin Singer, said in a statement. ""It comes as no surprise that Warner Bros., as a result of its own internal investigation, would state that no wrongdoing had occurred. Our own investigation will continue based on multiple new witnesses coming forward revealing what they saw and heard.""  Early Tuesday, Warner Bros. TV announced that production would resume on the current fourth season of the spinoff after an internal investigation found no evidence of the alleged misconduct that was first reported on June 11. ""We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a castmember. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any castmember was ever in jeopardy,"" Warner Bros. said in a statement.  Despite the delay in production, ABC confirmed that Bachelor in Paradise would air this summer as planned. ""We appreciate the swift and complete investigation by Warner Bros. into allegations of misconduct on the set of Bachelor in Paradise,"" a network spokesperson said in a statement. ""Given their results, the series will resume production, and will air this summer on ABC.""  Shortly after announcing the cast for this summer's season on June 6, Warner Bros. halted production to investigate a misconduct incident on the Sayulita, Mexico, set. A producer filed a complaint over an alleged sexual encounter between two contestants who had been drinking, Olympios and DeMario Jackson. It remains unclear if the producer witnessed the incident or had seen the footage, though sources tell The Hollywood Reporter Olympios was ""lucid"" and ""conversational"" on the tape. Still, since alcohol was involved, there was a question of whether one or both parties may have been too intoxicated to give consent.  The season four castmates were sent back to the U.S. the same day Warner Bros. announced the investigation, with most arriving home by June 12. When the cast was told to pack their bags, they were informed that they ""might"" return. It remains unclear if either Jackson or Olympios will return to continue filming.  Both Olympios and Jackson lawyered up in the days following the production suspension, with Olympios retaining top Hollywood litigator Singer and Jackson hiring L.A.-based attorney Walter Mosley.  Olympios issued her first and so far only statement about the matter on June 14. ""I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4,"" she said at the time. ""Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production.  ""As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality. As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.""  While many of those associated with the show, including series creator Mike Fleiss, host Chris Harrison and several of the contestants from the current season celebrated Warner Bros.' decision to resume filming, other insiders are questioning the move after Bachelor in Paradise appeared all but destined for cancellation in recent days following fallout from the scandal.  As part of its lengthy statement Tuesday, Warner Bros. said it plans to ""implement changes to the show's policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.""  It also remains unclear what will happen to the tape of the alleged incident at the center of the investigation, which Warner Bros. said Tuesday it does not plan to release ""out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved."" That videotape could be a key piece of evidence in Singer's ongoing investigation into what transpired.  Before being selected for Bachelor in Paradise, Olympios appeared on season 21 of The Bachelor, where she competed for Nick Viall's affections. She placed fourth.",0
"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes’ romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes’ life is that she’s been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter’s philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  “My little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,” Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram.",1
"Need to catch up? Check out the previous Outlander recap here.  Both Brianna and Roger make the leap through time in this week’s Outlander, thank goodness. It’s been fun watching Jamie and Claire channel Bob Vila and all, but I’m ready for the Frasers and Rog all to be in one place (and century) so that the joyful reunions, tearful misunderstandings and 18th-century game of telephone* can get underway!  On a related note, this week’s episode brings back two characters we haven’t seen in a while: Frank and Laoghaire. For the first time, particularly in Laoghaire’s case, we see aspects of both that don’t come to light when the story is told from Claire’s perspective. Also: Nell Hudson doesn’t get nearly enough credit for how masterfully she plays Jamie’s ex-wife.  But wait, before I forget: Did Frank know Claire was destined to go back in time again?  Read on for the highlights of “Down the Rabbit Hole.”  *Don’t know what I’m talking about? You will, and soon!  BRIANNA ARRIVES | Brianna, who definitely made it back to old-timey Scotland, walks through the Highlands in the snow. She occasionally consults an old map, but she’s a long way from anything even slightly resembling civilization. At one point, she falls and severely hurts her ankle; when she soaks it in an icy stream to stem the swelling, we see that it’s badly sprained. But she pushes on, limping along a road and sleeping under the stars. She’s able to start a fire using a box of matches she wisely brought with her from the future, and she dines on a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich.  The next morning, though, she’s in a lot of pain and looks rather ashen. As she lurches through the forest, she notices smoke from a house’s chimney in the distance. But before she can do anything about it, she passes out.  BE LEERY, IT’S LAOGHAIRE! | Bree dreams/remembers herself as young girl, with Frank (hi, Tobias Menzies!) gently lifting her out of a car she’d fallen asleep in. When she actually wakes, she’s tucked into a bed in a cozy home, and Laoghaire — !!! — was her savior.  The wenchiest wench who ever wenched Laoghaire and Joanie were walking home, it turns out, when they found Bree near a tree. “We had no choice but to bring you home with us,” the older woman explains, introducing herself and her younger daughter and telling Bree she can stay as long as she needs to. Brianna tells them she’s from England but her parents are in North Carolina, and that she’s going to meet them there. “Marsali’s in North Carolina!” Joanie pipes up.  A note before we move on: In Drums of Autumn, Brianna shows up at Lallybroch first. That’s where she meets Ian and Jenny, and her first interaction with Laoghaire is decidedly different (read: Bree knows who she is right away, and she shocks everyone by announcing that Laoghaire was behind the business at Cranesmuir. In short, they yell at each other a lot). “We had plans to go to Lallybroch and do certain things,” executive producer Matthew B. Roberts told me, “and then through actor availability we were unable to tell the story exactly the way that we wanted to. So we had to revamp.”  SHIPPIN’ OUT | Back in 1969, Roger and Fiona drive to Craig na Dun. He’s shaved his beard and dressed in period garb in preparation for his trip, and he’s got money, a compass, a knife and some gemstones to see him safely into the past. As they walk toward the circle, he hears a buzzing, but Fiona can’t. “The stones dinna call to me,” she reminds him. They hug, then he walks toward the stone and puts his palms on it. Later, Fi!  We don’t see him again until he’s in the 1700s, seeking passage to the Carolinas. Oh look, Roger has found himself another knit cap. Joy. The captain of the Gloriana — wait a minute, it’s Stephen Bonnet! — says he’s going to Wilmington but isn’t accepting any more passengers. So Roger hoists a barrel over his shoulder to prove that he’s hale and hearty enough to join the crew. Bonnet looks amused, so he flips a coin to decide whether or not Rog can come aboard. When the toss comes out in Roger’s favor, Bonnet snarks, “There’s four ports before Wilmington. I hope she’s worth it.”  A VERRA INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT | Her first night at Laoghaire’s, Ian comes to give Laoghaire some money. But it’s not the full amount of monthly alimony Jamie owes her, and she’s verra testy about that. The next morning, Bree dons one of Marsali’s dresses and comes to help Laoghaire and Joanie in the garden. That’s where the little girl tells her about her “Da,” who raised her but wasn’t her biological father. The two redheads bond over being brought up by good men who weren’t in love with their mothers.  And that leads us to a very intriguing flashback set right around the time of Brianna’s high school graduation. The teen finds her father in his office at Harvard, drunk-ish and despondent. He won’t say precisely why, but when Bree asks what some papers on his desk are, we can see that he had a copy of Claire and Jamie’s death notice — the same one Roger and Bree found independently of each other — way back then. He brushes it off as “research from a colleague in Scotland,” and when she presses, only adding that it’s “complicated.” He eventually sends her home, and she leaves in a huff.  THIS IS INTERESTING, NO, OLDLANDERS? In the books, we learn that Frank knew Jamie survived the Battle of Culloden, but it’s unclear how much more research he did after that. But this slight change indicates that Frank not only knew Jamie eventually died in North Carolina… but that Claire was with him when it happened. So you can look at this scene as Frank realizing that no matter what he does, Claire is destined to leave him again and go back through the stones. It also might explain why — in Season 3 and in another flashback in this episode — he pushes so hard for Brianna to move to England with him: If Claire is going to leave them, they might as well make that break on their own terms, possibly sparing Bree a little of the pain? Or maybe he’s doing it to make things easier for Claire, to tie up some loose ends ahead of time?  Of course, he doesn’t tell Brianna any of this. And when he announces the divorce and pitches the move, she soundly rejects both. “Sometimes, life takes unexpected turns. And when it does, you know what we do? We soldier on,” he tells her, but she’s very upset and leaves so they can’t discuss it further. Sadly, we know that this is just before he gets into the car accident, meaning that their last conversation was an angry one. Much later, at his graveside, Brianna cries as she promises him she’ll “soldier on.”  THE TRUTH COMES OUT | Bree’s sojourn at Laoghaire’s house is going along swimmingly until the blonde mentions Lallybroch. Brianna perks up and says that her relatives live there and her mother spent time there. “And who might your mother be?” Laoghaire politely inquires. “Claire Fraser,” Bree answers. Hold onto yer stomachers, because it’s going to get wild in here! Laoghaire’s manner goes from maternal to brittle REAL fast. Without letting on that she knows precisely who Bree’s mama is, the blonde besom starts talking smack about how Jamie left Claire when he found out she was pregnant. “I dinna like to repeat such things myself,” she adds, airily, which makes me guffaw.  “I can prevent their deaths if I go to them now. There’s going to be a fire,” Bree says, which immediately makes Laoghaire suspicious. Um, Brianna? First rule of time-travel club? DON’T TALK ABOUT TIME-TRAVEL CLUB. Ultimately, Laoghaire only wants the money she’s owed, and she fears that the Frasers sent Bree there to spy on her. “Your mother is the thieving whore who stole my husband and left me destitute!” she yells, and things only get louder from there.  When Bree goes to pack her things, Laoghaire follows her. “Claire Fraser should have burnt at the stake in Cranesmuir,” she spits. A penny drops for Brianna: “Oh my God: You’re the one who tried to have my mother killed!” In Laoghaire’s mind, this just cements the notion that Bree is just the latest witch in Claire’s coven, and she says as much. “I’m sure believing that is easier than facing the truth. And the truth is that Jamie Fraser has never loved you,” Bree shoots back. So Laoghaire locks her in the bedroom and says she’ll have her guest arrested for witchcraft.  BONNET’S A BADDIE | On the Gloriana, Roger is friendly with a female passenger who’s traveling with an infant. That night, he’s awakened by a woman’s scream, and he runs to see what’s up. A young girl passenger has smallpox, and her mother is begging Bonnet not to toss her out the window to stem the spread of the disease. Roger begs Bonnet, as well, but the stone-cold captain pushes the child into the icy waters. Her mother dives in after her. They’re both doomed. As Roger reels in shock, Bonnet orders the crew to examine everyone and bring him anyone who’s ill.  The infant’s mother, whose name is Morag MacKenzie, freaks out: The baby is teething, which makes him seem like he’s poxed, but he’s not. So Roger promises to hide her and baby Jemmy and bring them food, a plan that Bonnet eventually realizes and confronts them both. “Would you say you’re a gambling man, MacKenzie?” Bonnet asks, flipping a coin to see whether Roger lives or dies. It comes out in his favor; Bonnet leaves them alone.  BREE MEETS HER UNCLE | Bree has just managed to get a window of her new prison open when wee Joanie unlocks the door and drives her over to Lallybroch. “It’s not your fault your mother is a witch,” the little girl tells her. What a good kid!  Jenny’s away helping birth a grandchild, but Ian is at home when Bree arrives. He instantly believes what she says, noting that she has Claire’s eyes, and calls her “an unexpected blessing.” Then he gives her money to buy passage to the colonies, a trunk full of Claire’s old clothes and a tip to find Jocasta at River Run when she arrives in North Carolina. Man, Ian is always, always the best.  At the port, just before Bree books passage, she’s approached by a man named Joseph Wemyss who begs her to take his daughter on as a servant. Brianna is uninterested, but his story about how another man will buy the girl and keep her as a concubine sways her a bit. So pretty soon Brianna and Lizzie Wemyss (who looks nothing like I pictured her from the book, but whatever) are both heading out to board the Philip Alonso.  Before they get on the ship, Brianna takes a look back and imagines Frank standing there and nodding fondly at her. Then she turns around and heads into her next adventure.  Now it’s your turn.

"Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav — real name, William Drayton — contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts “to minimize his role in the Public Enemy business” over the years, while managers continued to exploit “his fame and persona to market the brand.”  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

"It took Kelly Ripa more than a year to find the right co-host for Live after Michael Strahan unexpectedly left for Good Morning America. Now, her incredible chemistry with Strahan’s replacement, Ryan Seacrest, is undeniable, but in the midst of the sexual misconduct allegations against him, Ripa is feeling betrayed and torn about standing beside him. Could these skeletons in Seacrest’s closet force Ripa to leave the popular morning show?  According to Life & Style, in the era of the #MeToo and #Time’sUp movements every business is playing it safe, and that means things could change at Live, especially if ratings start to drop and big names start to avoid the show.  “[Kelly’s] waiting to see what happens with Ryan. But [either way] this is a dark period for her,” reveals an insider. “She’s pissed…Kelly feels blindsided. The last thing she needs is celebrities boycotting. Everyone is on pins and needles.”  At this point, Ripa and Seacrest are still interviewing A-listers on the show, but that wasn’t the case when he was on the Oscar red carpet earlier this month. While hosting the E! Live from the Red Carpet Oscar special, Seacrest obviously had a slow night after publicists decided to steer their clients away from him because of the sexual misconduct claims.  This resulted in a 43 percent drop in ratings in key demographics compared to 2017, plus a 35 percent drop in overall number of viewers.  Ripa and her husband, Mark Consuelos, did walk by and acknowledge Seacrest by telling him he looked amazing and was doing a great job, but that doesn’t mean she still isn’t conflicted about the allegations.  She does want to side with her co-host, but no one thought he had any skeletons in the closet, and everyone is asking if he knew this was going to come out.  Ripa did seemingly take a dig at Seacrest on the show late last month when she asked him if he wanted her to put his shoes back on after they talked about having a treadmill day on the show. It seemed to be a reference to the allegations against Seacrest that included him pushing his accuser’s head towards his crotch while she tied his shoes.  But, the next day, Ripa told audiences that she fully supported her co-host, saying that she adores him, and it is a privilege to work with him, and those words led Seacrest to tears.  Oscar emcee Jimmy Kimmel also had no problem talking with Seacrest and avoiding jumping to any conclusions about the allegations. He said that we should afford people the opportunity for truth and find out the facts before hanging someone out to dry.

"It’s official! On Tuesday, USA Network officially announced that original Suits cast member Meghan Markle is leaving the legal drama at the end of season 7. The word arrives a day after news broke of her engagement to Prince Harry of Wales.  This certainly doesn’t come as a surprise. Two weeks ago, it was reported that she and fellow original cast member Patrick J. Adams would depart once their contracts were up at the end of the upcoming season, and Markle noted in her joint interview with Prince Harry that she was leaving acting behind. There is no word yet if Adams will remain past season 7.  For the past seven seasons, Markle played the tenacious Rachel Zane, an ambitious paralegal who eventually became a full fledged lawyer at the show’s central law firm. Along the way, Rachel began dating and eventually got engaged to the firm’s wonder-boy, Mike Ross (Adams).  USA Network and Universal Cable Productions released the following statement: “From all of us at USA Network and Universal Cable Productions, we want to send our most heartfelt congratulations to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on their engagement. Meghan has been a member of our family for seven years and it has been a joy to work with her. We want to thank her for her undeniable passion and dedication to Suits, and we wish her the very best.”  The seventh season of Suits will resume in 2018.",0
"The 2018 Grammys, the 60th installment of the music industry’s flagship awards show, were handed out on Sunday night. And the night belonged to Bruno Mars.  Heading into the awards, Mars and Jay-Z led the nominations. But Mars ultimately swept the three biggest honors of the night, taking home Album of the Year and Record of the Year for 24k Magic and winning Song of the Year for “That’s What I Like.”  Related 3 reasons why the 2018 Grammys fell so flat  Mars won six Grammys overall. In the end, Jay-Z was completely shut out and went home empty handed.  The Grammys handed out more than 80 golden gramophones in total, including in dozens of categories whose winners were announced shortly before the live telecast. Going into the ceremony, for example, Mars had already won three Grammys: Best R&B Album for 24K Magic and Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song for “That’s What I Like.”  Another big winner from the preshow awards was Kendrick Lamar, who won five Grammys total: He was honored with Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance, and Best Music Video for “HUMBLE” during the preshow, and during the main ceremony, he won Best Rap/Sung Performance for “Loyalty” with Rihanna and Best Rap Album for DAMN.

"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Kevin Federline wants to triple the $20,000 in monthly child support he receives from Britney Spears.  Federline, 40, claims that Spears’ increased earnings compared with his decreasing income create “an extreme disparity” in their sons’ lifestyles from her home to his, documents obtained by The Blast revealed Tuesday.  Federline alleged in the documents that his work as a DJ nets him less than 1 percent of Spears’ reported $34 million income because he is “less of a name” than he was in 2008 when he took in six figures.  The former backup dancer claims he earns roughly $3,000 per month but that he doesn’t know how much Spears, 36, truly earns because she has allegedly refused to turn over her tax returns or reveal her income.  The couple, who were married from 2004 to 2007, agreed at the time that Spears would make $20,000 monthly child support payments to Federline for sons Sean Preston, 12, and Jayden James, 11. She also gave him $1.3 million at the time of their split.  Spears agreed to the terms through her father, Jamie, who controls her finances through a conservatorship to this day following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007.  Since then, she’s landed two lucrative Las Vegas residencies, gone on tour, released four new albums, five compilation albums, 18 fragrances and a lingerie line.  Federline laments in the documents that “[Spears] is a single woman who lives alone in a 13,264 square foot Neoclassical Italianate villa on 21 acres of land in a gated community with an elevator, a library, a media/game room, 3,500 bottle wine cellar, an additional 1,200 square foot pool house, an orchard, resort-sized pool and spa, lighted tennis court and three-green golf course. In contrast, Respondent lives with his wife, his two minor children from his current marriage, the two minor children he shares with Petitioner and two minor children from a previous relationship in a 2,000 square foot home.”  He claims that Spears (who’s currently dating hunky fitness junkie Sam Asghari) offers the boys amenities including private chefs, tutors, nannies and other staff, as well as the best toys and gadgets available and that he simply can’t keep up with their luxuries in his 2,000-square-foot home, in which his wife Victoria Prince, their two children and his two children from ex-wife Shar Jackson all live.  Federline has previously rejected attempts to settle the child support battle without litigation.  “It’s their position that they don’t have to turn over Britney’s financial information, including tax returns, which is required under the California family code. It’s not California celebrity code edition, she has to comply,” Federline’s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told Us Weekly Tuesday. “This is the choice they have made, and they will now have to deal with it. We are still open to try and settling this without judicial intervention.”  Neither a rep nor an attorney for Spears immediately returned a request for comment.",0

When asked to explain why she was done with the show, the 39-year-old said it was “too much stress — unneeded stress” but that fans could still check her out on Don’t Be Tardy, which Bravo recently confirmed would be coming back for a seventh season.

A lot of negativity,” she told PEOPLE in July, when looking back on her time on the show. “I just was extremely frustrated — it just was really a trying season for me. I had had enough.”  But after years of being away from RHOA, Zolciak-Biermann returned to the show for Shereé Whitfield’s housewarming party at the season 9 finale — where she quickly butted heads with Kenya Moore.  Asked at the time if she would consider rejoining the show for its 10th season, Zolciak-Biermann told PEOPLE she would consider it.  “I’m very motivated by money,” she said. “Everything has a price.

After agreeing to return to the show in season 10 as a “Friend of the Housewives,” Zolciak-Biermann quickly became involved in some major drama with fellow OG Atlanta Housewife Leakes. The most explosive incident came when Zolciak-Biermann said Leakes was “sick and disgusting” and lived in a “roach nest,” which came to be known as #RoachGate.  Leakes responded with her own slams, calling Zolciak-Biermann “racist” and claiming she and her daughter Brielle “don’t like black people.”  RELATED VIDEO: RHOA’s Kim Zolciak Says She Received Death Threats After NeNe Leakes Called Her ‘Racist’  In a preview for Sunday’s RHOA season 10 reunion part 2, Zolciak-Biermann and Leakes face off about their troubles in a heated battle that appears to lead to Zolciak-Biermann walking off the reunion stage in anger.

"About The Duchess of Cambridge The Duchess of Cambridge, born Catherine Elizabeth Middleton, married Prince William at Westminster Abbey in April 2011. Their Royal Highnesses have three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The family's official residence is Kensington Palace. As well as undertaking royal duties in support of The Queen, both in the UK and overseas, The Duchess devotes her time to supporting a number of charities and organisations. Children's mental health The Duchess of Cambridge is a committed champion of issues related to children’s mental health and emotional wellbeing. Her Royal Highness has worked to bring wider public attention to the fact that issues facing children today such as addiction, poverty, abuse, neglect, loss and illness of family members, can have a long-lasting and traumatic impact if left unsupported. In particular she has highlighted the need for open and honest conversations about the subject to try and combat stigma, and also the importance of early intervention mental health support for young people, to tackle these issues at the earliest possible stage, so that children have the brightest possible futures, as they deserve. It is our duty, as parents and as teachers, to give all children the space to build their emotional strength and provide a strong foundation for their future The Duchess of Cambridge Heads Together In 2017 The Duchess spearheaded the Heads Together mental health campaign with The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, leading a coalition of eight mental health charity partners to change the national conversation on mental health. The campaign aimed to build on existing progress nationwide in tackling stigma, raising awareness, and providing vital help for people with mental health problems. The team of charities covered a wide range of mental health issues that are close to The Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry's passions. They were: Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families; Best Beginnings; CALM – The Campaign Against Living Miserably; Contact (a military mental health coalition); Mind; Place2Be; The Mix; YoungMinds. Heads Together was privileged to be the 2017 Virgin Money London Marathon Charity of the Year giving the campaign a positive platform to raise funds for the charity partners and to start millions of conversations about mental wellbeing. Addiction Through her work with Action on Addiction, The Duchess of Cambridge was struck by the fact that children of addicts are twice as likely to go on to become addicts themselves. In 2013, The Duchess of Cambridge launched M-PACT Plus, an initiative to support children, parents and families affected by parental drug and alcohol misuse, with the aim of providing early specialist support to children to prevent these inevitable outcomes. The project involves training school staff to identify children affected by a parent's drug or alcohol misuse. It then brings families together to work with trained practitioners. The project was convened at Her Royal Highness's request by her own charity The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Children's palliative care The Duchess of Cambridge is a committed supporter of children’s hospices and wider palliative care, which provides a vital lifeline to children and families affected by life-limiting conditions. Through her Royal engagements, charitable patronages and in speeches, she has worked to bring wider public attention to the hospice movement, and the holistic services they offer to families. The Duchess of Cambridge has been publicly involved in this area since she became Royal Patron of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH) in January 2012. She has supported their major fundraising efforts to build a new children's hospice The Nook, in Norfolk. Royal patronages The Duchess is Patron of 13 organisations, where she feels her support can make a difference. These broadly reflect her interests in supporting the most vulnerable families and young people, promoting opportunities though sport, and showcasing national institutions. As their Royal Patron, The Duchess will back their key projects and initiatives, spotlight their work through her programme of official engagements and where appropriate by convening organisations to work in support of each other. The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry In addition to supporting charities and organisations, The Duchess of Cambridge, like her husband and Prince Harry, is able to direct her own philanthropic work through The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The Royal Foundation develops programmes and charitable projects based on the interests of Their Royal Highnesses by working with organisations which are already making a proven impact in their respective fields. The Royal Foundation provides additional investment, mentoring, support and partnerships for these programmes, and lends its own profile and leverage to enhance the effect of their good work.  Biography The Duchess of Cambridge became a member of the Royal Family in 2011, upon her marriage to Prince William. Since that time, she has taken on Royal duties in support of The Queen through engagements at home and overseas, alongside a portfolio of charitable work and patronages. The Duchess's charitable work is driven by a personal desire to help make a difference in some key areas, where she feels her support can help. In recent years, The Duchess has drawn attention to the importance of supporting the mental health and emotional wellbeing of children, the impact of addiction on children and families, and the necessary measures to support children suffering from family breakdown.

They also led the August 2014 services commemorating the centenary of the First World War in Liege, joining Prince Harry at a service in Saint Symphorien cemetery near Mons, Belgium. In 2016, The Duchess of Cambridge joined other members of the Royal Family at events in France to mark the centenary of the Battle of the Somme. In July 2017, The Duchess joined The Duke of Cambridge and The King and Queen of the Belgians at the commemorations to mark the centenary of Passchendaele – The Third Battle of Ypres, in Belgium. Royal tours The Duchess of Cambridge has carried out a number of overseas visits with her husband including to Realm and Commonwealth nations on behalf of The Queen, or to undertake an official tour to represent Britain at the request of the Government. The Duchess's first official overseas tour was to Canada in July 2011. For their second tour, in 2012 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Malaysia, Singapore, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu as part of Her Majesty The Queen's Diamond Jubilee year celebrations.

The Duchess made solo visits to the Netherlands in October 2016 and, at the request of Her Majesty's Government, to Luxembourg in May 2017 to participate in the official commemoration of the 1867 Treaty of London. During the visit, Her Royal Highness also attended a series of engagements to celebrate the cultural and historic ties between the UK and Luxembourg. National sporting events The Duchess of Cambridge, herself a keen sportswoman, also represents the Royal Family at major national sporting events to reflect the nation's support, in particular when Great Britain is acting as the host nation of a major event. Along with Prince Harry, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were Official Ambassadors for Team GB and Paralympic GB in the lead up to, and during, the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Again at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014, Their Royal Highnesses joined the thousands of fans watching the sports at the venues and also meeting the athletes. They joined forces again in 2014 to witness the spectacular Tour de France Grand Depart in Yorkshire, where they signalled the start of the race, and in 2015 supported Prince Harry in his role as President of the Rugby World Cup. The Duchess is an enthusiastic tennis fan and has regularly attended the Wimbledon Championships, including the men's final in 2014 and 2016, and the semi-final in 2015. At the end of The Queen's 90th birthday year, in 2016, Her Majesty stepped down as Patron from a number of national organisations – at this time The Duchess of Cambridge became Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club (AELTC) Wimbledon and the Lawn Tennis Association. The Duchess's first visit to The Championships as Patron of the AELTC was in July 2017.",0

"Follow­ing therap­y, actor has come to realis­e that Jen was the love of his life  Fans who’ve been rooting for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston ever since their 2005 split may actually have cause for hope! Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

Jon Bon Jovi, Sambora and Such were joined by current bandmates David Bryan, Tico Torres and Hugh McDonald at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland, where the Rock Hall is based.  They performed crowd favorites like ""You Give Love a Bad Name"" and ""It's My Life.""  Sambora left Bon Jovi in 2013 and Such in 1994. Each of the members spoke onstage, giving thanks for the honor and telling old stories about the New Jersey band. They all hugged as a group afterward.  Jon Bon Jovi, who gave a 20-minute speech onstage, said he has been writing his Rock Hall speech for years.

Simone received a passionate and show-stopping tribute from groundbreaking performers who she has deeply inspired, from Lauryn Hill to Mary J. Blige.  Hill was exceptional, stretching her voice as wide as possible, and singing in French, in honor of Simone's music. Hill earned a standing ovation from the audience.  Grammy-nominated R&B singer Andra Day was also extraordinary, hitting high notes that also earned her applause. Blige inducted Simone, calling the singer ""bold, strong, feisty and fearless.""  ""Her voice was so distinctive and powerful and I never heard anything like it,"" the R&B superstar said.  Simone, who died in 2003, was a leader in pushing for civil rights and influenced everyone from Aretha Franklin to Alicia Keys. Her brother, Sam Waymon, accepted the induction on his sister's behalf.  ""They said I had three minutes, I said, 'No, I don't.' I'm going to take the time necessary to say what I got to say,"" Waymon said.  Waymon said sharp words during his speech, including lines like, ""To all the brothers out there, protect your sisters. He said he always protected Simone, and continues to do so.  He also told the crowd, ""If you're sampling (Nina's) music, you better pay for it!""

Wilson of Heart said the English rockers ""are and have always been a kick ass rock band.""  Another English band, Dire Straits, was inducted at the event, but it was without its leader Mark Knopfler, or his brother David Knopfler. In an interview ahead of the event, co-founding member and bassist John Illsley said Mark ""just didn't feel like coming, it's as simple as that.""  Onstage, Illsley said of Mark's absence: ""I'll assure you it's a personal thing. Let's just leave it at that.""  Illsley thanked the entire band and described the group as ""a collective, a brotherhood."" There was no performance following the band members' speeches.  A flawless Brittany Howard, of the critically acclaimed rock act Alabama Shakes, gave an extraordinary Tharpe impression onstage, winning over the audience with her rousing live performance in honor of the godmother of rock 'n' roll. Howard was backed by an equally appealing Questlove of The Roots on the drums. Felicia Collins, best known has a member of the band on ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" also wowed the audience when she performed a tribute to Tharpe.  ""It's been long overdue. I'm honored to induct Sister Rosetta Tharpe into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,"" Howard yelled following a video package featuring past interviews from Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin and others praising Tharpe's musicality.

"After hearing the news that American Idol would be returning to TV next year, we were full of questions: Who would the next judges be? Would J.Lo continue to serve up amazing glam moments? Would Ryan Seacrest give up his spot at Live with Kelly?  Nevertheless, we were giddy with excitement, and since the announcement that Katy Perry would take one of the coveted judge's seats for the new season, our enthusiasm was brought to a whole other level. Perry seems pretty thrilled by the news too, and the ""Bon Appetit"" singer's reported $25 million paycheck (and what would be the biggest salary in the show's history), according to TMZ, is the cherry on the cake (or in the pie?).  The news came up during Perry's appearance on 103.5 KTU with Carolina Bermudez on Tuesday. The radio show host asked the songstress if it bothers her that the entire Internet is talking about how much she's getting paid for the gig, and Perry had the perfect response for any naysayers: ""I'm really proud that, as a woman, I got paid,"" she said. ""And you know why? I got paid like more than like pretty much any guy that's been on that show. And, by the way, I love men. So I'm a paid woman and I'm ready for a beautiful man.""  No matter how big the payout, Perry's ultimate goal is finding America's next rising star. ""This show is about finding real talent, making peoples' dreams come true and additionally hearing their stories,"" she said. ""I want to see you. I want to hear you. I want to witness you.""

The 46th edition of the calendar was shot by Albert Watson and meant to look like film stills. “Each character has a part to play in the 2019 Pirelli Calendar,” Watson explained. “In some cases, the role was close to what the actress does for a living, but here they were certainly all acting a part. Not themselves. And that’s what I wanted.”  The theme of the collection is titled “dreams” because each woman is focused on their future in the stills. “The basic idea behind the whole project is that of telling a story in four ‘little movies,'” Watson said.  Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  For Hadid’s part, she played a woman who just broke up with her companion (don’t worry — IRL she’s still with Zayn Malik).  “She has a confidant, not a boyfriend, played by the designer Alexander Wang,” said Watson. “He is helping her get over this difficult time. I think there’s a degree of angst in these images.

A source told the New York Post's gossip column Page Six that the new relationship is the reason neither star attended the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday (08Jan17), where Rooney's movie Lion was up for four gongs.  “They were holed up together in the desert (instead),” the insider added.  While images emerged of Joaquin and Rooney shooting Mary Magdalene, they were also seen spending time together off set, including sharing cigarettes on the balcony of a room at their hotel in Matera, southern Italy, last November (16).  The claims surrounding Rooney's new romance comes after reports she has split from director Charlie McDowell after six years together. Both Rooney and Charlie's representatives had no comment when contacted by Page Six, and the pair have not been photographed together since August (16).  Despite Page Six's report, Joaquin's representative has denied the actor and Rooney are anything apart from ""good friends"".  “They worked on (2013 film) Her, Mary Magdalene and their next movie (Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot, due for release in 2018),” his rep said. “They are and have been good friends for quite a long time.”  Joaquin has previously been romantically linked to actresses Liv Tyler and Anna Paquin, and DJ Allie Teilz. He hit headlines in 2014 when he announced he was engaged to a yoga instructor who had helped him ""harness his hog"", but it was later revealed to be an unusual joke.  © Cover Media  Belfast Telegraph Digital",1
"Holy moly! A (fake) picture of a shark swimming on a Puerto Rico street! (Reddit)That’s because it is.Google “shark,” and up pops a great photo of a shark stalking a kayak from a 2005 issue of Africa Geographic.. Commenters on Reddit, where the photo seems to have originated, quickly noted this and the very real similarities between the two sharks (note the small circular shadow just below the shark’s belly.)Some sites have since realized their error. Neatorama, for example, has removed its story with the photo called “Thank you, Hurricane Irene: Shark in the street.” We’ve asked Channel 7 in Miami, which broadcast the user-submitted photo, if it plans to inform viewers about its fakeness. We will update this post if we hear back.This phenomenon is nothing new. After the death of Osama bin Laden, a fake photo of his body circulated on Arab news outlets.

"Jamie Foxx did not “betray” Katie Holmes by supposedly “getting flirty” with a mystery blonde at a New York City hotspot, despite a bogus report. Gossip Cop can debunk this narrative. It’s simply a non-issue.  According to In Touch, just a few days after the actor had dinner with Holmes at Tao in NYC, he got cozy with another woman while having lunch at the trendy seafood restaurant Catch. An alleged insider tells the magazine, “When Jamie arrived to the rooftop area with friends, an attractive young blonde went and sat with them. She hugged Jamie and sat next to him.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Foxx “would reach over and touch the woman’s leg or hold her hand” throughout the lunch. The magazine then baselessly theorizes that Holmes is “headed for heartbreak,” quoting its supposed insider as saying, “She needs to watch out. Jamie loves her, but he also loves to flirt.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  It should be noted, the tabloid doesn’t have any real proof that Foxx got “flirty” with a mystery blonde at Catch. The outlet provides two photos, one of the actor giving a friendly hug to an unidentified woman, and another of him touching the woman’s arm during a conversation. That’s as intimate as the two get in the images and there’s no evidence to suggest they’re anything more than friends.  Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm that Holmes doesn’t feel “betrayed” when the actor socializes with other woman. The actor and actress have a somewhat unconventional dynamic, which People also noted in a recent article about Holmes and Foxx’s secretive relationship. The publication explained that the two “don’t see themselves as a couple in the traditional sense and they don’t want to be labeled as a couple.” It was further stressed that neither “want to have expectations placed on them about how they should be acting in public.”  Meanwhile, the unreliable magazine is trying to make it seem as if Foxx was caught acting inappropriately by talking to another woman, but he has nothing to hide. A mutual pal of ours and the movie star recently told us “he knows he’s in a public forum” when he chats with other women. As we’ve repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes enjoy spending time together, but their dynamic is relaxed and both have their own separate lives.  Additionally, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has called out In Touch for coming up with a variation of this phony premise. Back in March, we busted the tabloid for falsely claiming that Foxx “betrayed” Holmes by “getting cozy” with a mystery woman at an Oscar party. However, the actor and actress have been spotted together several times since March, so she obviously didn’t feel “betrayed.” That remains the case.",1
"Shapeshift redirects here. For the Swiss company, see ShapeShift  ""Shapeshifter"" redirects here. For other uses, see Shapeshifter (disambiguation)  ""The giant Galligantua and the wicked old magician transform the duke's daughter into a white hind ."" by Arthur Rackham  In mythology, folklore and speculative fiction, shapeshifting is the ability of a being or creature to completely transform its physical form or shape. This is usually achieved through an inherent ability of a mythological creature, divine intervention, or the use of magic.  The idea of shapeshifting is present in the oldest forms of totemism and shamanism, as well as the oldest extant literature and epic poems, including works such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Iliad, where the shapeshifting is usually induced by the act of a deity. The idea persisted through the Middle Ages, where the agency causing shapeshifting is usually a sorcerer or witch, and into the modern period. It remains a common trope in modern fantasy, children's literature, and works of popular culture.  The most common form of shapeshifting myths is that of therianthropy, which is the transformation of a human being into an animal or conversely, of an animal into human form. Legends allow for transformations into plants and objects, and the assumption of another human countenance (e.g. fair to ugly).  Folklore and mythology [ edit ]  1722 German woodcut of a werewolf transforming  Popular shapeshifting creatures in folklore are werewolves and vampires (mostly of European, Canadian, and Native American/early American origin), the huli jing of East Asia (including the Japanese kitsune and Korean kumiho), and the gods, goddesses, and demons of numerous mythologies, such as the Norse Loki or the Greek Proteus. Shapeshifting to the form of a wolf is specifically known as lycanthropy, and such creatures who undergo such change are called lycanthropes. Therianthropy is the more general term for human-animal shifts, but it is rarely used in that capacity. It was also common for deities to transform mortals into animals and plants.  Other terms for shapeshifters include metamorph, the Navajo skin-walker, mimic, and therianthrope. The prefix ""were-,"" coming from the Old English word for ""man"" (masculine rather than generic), is also used to designate shapeshifters; despite its root, it is used to indicate female shapeshifters as well.  While the popular idea of a shapeshifter is of a human being who turns into something else, there are numerous stories about animals that can transform themselves as well.[1]  Examples of shapeshifting in classical literature include many examples in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Circe's transforming of Odysseus' men to pigs in Homer's The Odyssey, and Apuleius's Lucius becoming a donkey in The Golden Ass. Proteus was noted among the gods for his shapeshifting; both Menelaus and Aristaeus seized him to win information from him, and succeeded only because they held on during his various changes. Nereus told Heracles where to find the Apples of the Hesperides for the same reason.  The Titan Metis, the first wife of Zeus and the mother of the goddess Athena, was believed to be able to change her appearance into anything she wanted. In one story, she was so proud, that her husband, Zeus, tricked her into changing into a fly. He then swallowed her because he feared that he and Metis would have a son who would be more powerful than Zeus himself. Metis, however, was already pregnant. She stayed alive inside his head and built armor for her daughter. The banging of her metalworking made Zeus have a headache, so Hephaestus clove his head with an axe. Athena sprang from her father's head, fully grown, and in battle armor.  In Greek mythology, the transformation is often a punishment from the gods to humans who crossed them.  Zeus transformed King Lycaon and his children into wolves (hence lycanthropy) as a punishment for either killing Zeus' children or serving him the flesh of Lycaon's own murdered son Nyctimus, depending on the exact version of the myth.  Demeter transformed Ascalabus into a lizard for mocking her sorrow and thirst during her search for her daughter Persephone. She also turned King Lyncus into a lynx for trying to murder her prophet Triptolemus.  Athena transformed Arachne into a spider for challenging her as a weaver and/or weaving a tapestry that insulted the gods.  Artemis transformed Actaeon into a stag for spying on her bathing, and he was later devoured by his own hunting dogs.  Galanthis was transformed into a weasel or cat after interfering in Hera's plans to hinder the birth of Heracles.  Atalanta and Hippomenes were turned into lions after making love in one of Zeus' temples.  Io was a priestess of Hera in Argos, a nymph who was raped by Zeus, who changed her into a heifer to escape detection.  Hera punished young Tiresias by transforming him into a woman and, seven years later, back into a man.  While the Greek gods could use transformation punitively – such as Medusa, turned to a monster for having sexual intercourse with Poseidon in Athena's temple – even more frequently, the tales using it are of amorous adventure. Zeus repeatedly transformed himself to approach mortals as a means of gaining access:[2]  Danaë as a shower of gold  Europa as a bull  Leda as a swan  Ganymede, as an eagle  Alcmene as her husband Amphitryon  Hera as a cuckoo  Leto as a quail  Maia as a gopher  Semele as a mortal shepherd  Io, as a cloud  Nemesis (Goddess of retribution) transformed into a goose to escape Zeus' advances, but he turned into a swan. She later bore the egg in which Helen of Troy was found.  Vertumnus transformed himself into an old woman to gain entry to Pomona's orchard; there, he persuaded her to marry him.  In other tales, the woman appealed to other gods to protect her from rape, and was transformed (Daphne into laurel, Cornix into a crow). Unlike Zeus and other gods' shapeshifting, these women were permanently metamorphosed.  In one tale, Demeter transformed herself into a mare to escape Poseidon, but Poseidon counter-transformed himself into a stallion to pursue her, and succeeded in the rape. Caenis, having been raped by Poseidon, demanded of him that she be changed to a man. He agreed, and she became Caeneus, a form he never lost, except, in some versions, upon death.  As a final reward from the gods for their hospitality, Baucis and Philemon were transformed, at their deaths, into a pair of trees.  In some variants of the tale of Narcissus, he is turned into a narcissus flower.  After Tereus raped Philomela and cut out her tongue to silence her, she wove her story into a tapestry for her sister, Tereus's wife Procne, and the sisters murdered his son and fed him to his father. When he discovered this, he tried to kill them, but the gods changed them all into birds.  Sometimes metamorphoses transformed objects into humans. In the myths of both Jason and Cadmus, one task set to the hero was to sow dragon's teeth; on being sown, they would metamorphose into belligerent warriors, and both heroes had to throw a rock to trick them into fighting each other to survive. Deucalion and Pyrrha repopulated the world after a flood by throwing stones behind them; they were transformed into people. Cadmus is also often known to have transformed into a dragon or serpent towards the end of his life. Pygmalion fell in love with Galatea, a statue he had made. Aphrodite had pity on him and transformed the stone to a living woman.  British and Irish [ edit ]  Fairies, witches, and wizards were all noted for their shapeshifting ability. Not all fairies could shapeshift, and some were limited to changing their size, as with the spriggans, and others to a few forms and other fairies might have only the appearance of shapeshifting, through their power, called ""glamour,"" to create illusions.[3] But others, such as the Hedley Kow, could change to many forms, and both human and supernatural wizards were capable of both such changes, and inflicting them on others.[4]  Witches could turn into hares and in that form steal milk and butter.[5]  Many British fairy tales, such as Jack the Giant Killer and The Black Bull of Norroway, feature shapeshifting.  Celtic mythology [ edit ]  Pwyll was transformed by Arawn into Arawn's own shape, and Arawn transformed himself into Pwyll's, so that they could trade places for a year and a day.  Llwyd ap Cil Coed transformed his wife and attendants into mice to attack a crop in revenge; when his wife is captured, he turned himself into three clergymen in succession to try to pay a ransom.  Math and Gwydion transform flowers into a woman named Blodeuwedd, and when she betrays her husband Lleu, who is transformed into an eagle, they transform her again, into an owl.  Gilfaethwy committed rape with help from his brother Gwydion. Both were transformed into animals, for one year each. Gwydion was transformed into a stag, sow and wolf, and Gilfaethwy into a hind, boar and she-wolf. Each year, they had a child. Math turned the three young animals into boys.  Gwion, having accidentally taken some of wisdom potion that Ceridwen was brewing for her son, fled her through a succession of changes that she answered with changes of her own, ending with his being eaten, a grain of corn, by her as a hen. She became pregnant, and he was reborn in a new form, as Taliesin.  Tales abound about the selkie, a seal that can remove its skin to make contact with humans for only a short amount of time before it must return to the sea. Clan MacColdrum of Uist's foundation myths include of a union between the founder of the clan and a shapeshifting selkie.[6] Another such creature is the Scottish selkie, which needs its sealskin to regain its form. In The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry the (male) selkie seduces a human woman. Such stories surrounding these creatures are usually romantic tragedies.  Scottish mythology features shapeshifters, which allows the various creatures to trick, deceive, hunt, and kill humans. Water spirits such as the each uisge, which inhabit lochs and waterways in Scotland, were said to appear as a horse or a young man.[4] Other tales include kelpies who emerge from lochs and rivers in the disguise of a horse or woman in order to ensnare and kill weary travelers. Tam Lin, a man captured by the Queen of the Fairies is changed into all manner of beasts before being rescued. He finally turned into a burning coal and was thrown him into a well, whereupon he reappeared in his human form. The motif of capturing a person by holding him through all forms of transformation is a common thread in folktales.[7]  Perhaps the best known Irish myth is that of Aoife who turned her stepchildren, the Children of Lir, into swans to be rid of them. Likewise in the Wooing of Etain Fuamnach jealously turns Étaín into a butterfly. The most dramatic example of shapeshifting in Irish myth is that of Tuan mac Cairill, the only survivor of Partholón's settlement of Ireland. In his centuries long life he became successively a stag, a wild boar, a hawk and finally a salmon prior to being eaten and (as in the Wooing of Étaín) reborn as a human.  The Púca is a Celtic faery, and also a deft shapeshifter. He can transform into many different, terrifying forms.  Sadhbh, the wife of the famous hero Fionn mac Cumhaill was changed into a deer by the druid Fer Doirich.  Norse [ edit ]  In the Lokasenna, Odin and Loki taunt each other with having taken the form of females and nursing offspring to which they had given birth. A 13th century Edda relates Loki taking the form of a mare to bear Odin's steed Sleipnir which was the fastest horse ever to exist, and also the form of a she-wolf to bear Fenrir.[8]  Svipdagr angered Odin, who turned him into a dragon. Despite his monstrous appearance, his lover, the goddess Freyja, refused to leave his side. When the warrior Hadding found and slew Svipdag, Freyja cursed him to be tormented by a tempest and shunned like the plague wherever he went. In the Hyndluljóð, Freyja transformed her protégé Óttar into a boar to conceal him. She also possessed a cloak of falcon feathers that allowed her to transform into a falcon, which Loki borrowed on occasion.  The Volsunga saga contains many shapeshifting characters. Siggeir's mother changed into a wolf to help torture his defeated brothers-in-law with slow and ignominious deaths. When one, Sigmund, survived, he and his nephew and son Sinfjötli killed men wearing wolfskins; when they donned the skins themselves, they were cursed to become werewolves.  The dwarf Andvari is described as being able to magically turn into a pike. Alberich, his counterpart in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, using the Tarnhelm, takes on many forms, including a giant serpent and a toad, in a failed attempt to impress or intimidate Loki and Odin/Wotan.  Fafnir was originally a dwarf, a giant or even a human, depending on the exact myth, but in all variants he transformed into a dragon—a symbol of greed—while guarding his ill-gotten hoard. His brother, Ótr, enjoyed spending time as an otter, which led to his accidental slaying by Loki.  In Scandinavia, there existed, for example, the famous race of she-werewolves known with a name of Maras, women who took on the appearance of the night looking for huge monster half human and half wolf. If a female at midnight stretches the membrane which envelopes the foal when it is brought forth, between four sticks and creeps through it, naked, she will bear children without pain; but all the boys will be shamans, and all the girls Maras.  The Nisse is sometimes said to be a shapeshifter. This trait also is attributed to Huldra.  Gunnhild, Mother of Kings (Gunnhild konungamóðir) (c. 910 – c. 980), a quasi-historical figure who appears in the Icelandic Sagas, according to which she was the wife of Eric Bloodaxe, was credited with magic powers - including the power of shapeshifting and turning at will into a bird. She is the central character of the novel Mother of Kings by Poul Anderson,[9] which considerably elaborates on her shapeshifting abilities.  Other lore [ edit ]  In Poland, in the parish church of Schwarzenstein, hang two horse-shoes related to the story of the tavern-keeper of Eichmedian. A greedy woman, she charged double the honest rate for board and lodging. Late one evening, a group of guests accused her of cheating them. Defending herself, she swore an oath before them, saying: ""If my business is not just, then ride my back the Devil must!""  The room suddenly darkened and the Devil suddenly appeared before her. He gestured, and unable to resist, she knelt on all fours and found herself changing into a bay mare. The Devil mounted, gave a great laugh and rode her out of the village. At headlong speed he rode to the town of Schwarzenstein, and to a blacksmith's shop there, arriving in the small hours of the morning. He roused the blacksmith and demanded that his steed be shod at once. The blacksmith, yawning, complained of the late hour and that his forge was shut down and cold. But the Devil insisted and promised gold if it were done swiftly, and so the blacksmith agreed. He lit his furnace, and had the Devil work the bellows. The blacksmith had not long begun his work however when the mare began to speak, evidently having worked out how to form human words with her equine lips. ""Don't you know me?"" she begged. ""It is I, the tavern-keeper of Eichmedian!"" The blacksmith was horrified and nothing could persuade him to continue with the shoeing. The Devil raged but there was nothing he could do, and as a cock heralded the arrival of dawn, the spell was broken. The Devil vanished and the tavern-keeper returned to her human form. Repenting of her greedy ways, she had the two horse-shoes which the smith had already fashioned nailed up in the church as a warning to other cheats.[citation needed]  Armenian [ edit ]  In Armenian mythology, shapeshifters include the Nhang, a serpent-like river monster than can transform itself into a woman or seal, and will drown humans and then drink their blood; or the beneficial Shahapet, a guardian spirit that can appear either as a man or a snake.[10]  Indian [ edit ]  Ancient Indian mythology tells of Nāga, snakes that can sometimes assume human form. Scriptures describe shapeshifting Rakshasa (demons) assuming animal forms to deceive humans. The Ramayana also includes the Vanara, a group of ape-like humanoids who possessed supernatural powers and could change their shapes.[11][12]  In the Indian fable The Dog Bride from Folklore of the Santal Parganas by Cecil Henry Bompas, a buffalo herder falls in love with a dog that has the power to turn into a woman when she bathes.  Philippines [ edit ]  Philippine mythology includes aswang, a vampire-like monster capable of transforming itself into either a large black dog or a black boar in order to stalk humans at night. The folklore also mentions other beings such as kapre, tikbalang, and engkanto, which change their appearances to woo beautiful maidens. Also, talismans (called ""anting-anting"" or ""birtud"" in the local dialect), can give their owners the ability to shapeshift. In one tale, Chonguita the Monkey Wife,[14] a woman is turned into a monkey, only becoming human again if she can marry a handsome man.  Tatar [ edit ]  Tatar folklore includes Yuxa, a hundred-year-old snake that can transform itself into a beautiful young woman, and seeks to marry men in order to have children.  ""Madame White Snake"" Picture on long veranda in the Summer Palace , Beijing, China  Chinese [ edit ]  Chinese mythology contains many tales of animal shapeshifters, capable of taking on human form. The most common such shapeshifter is the huli jing, a fox spirit which usually appears as a beautiful young woman; most are dangerous, but some feature as the heroines of love stories. Madame White Snake is one such legend; a snake falls in love with a man, and the story recounts the trials that she and her husband faced.  Japanese [ edit ]  Kuzunoha the fox woman, casting a fox shadow  In Japanese folklore ōbake are a type of yōkai with the ability to shapeshift. The fox, or kitsune is among the most commonly known, but other such creatures include the bakeneko, the mujina and the tanuki.  Korean [ edit ]  Korean mythology also contains a fox with the ability to shapeshift. Unlike its Chinese and Japanese counterparts, the kumiho is always malevolent. Usually its form is of a beautiful young woman; one tale recounts a man, a would-be seducer, revealed as a kumiho.[15] The kumiho has nine tails and as she desires to be a full human, she uses her beauty to seduce men and eat their hearts (or in some cases livers where the belief is that 100 livers would turn her into a real human).  Somali [ edit ]  In Somali mythology Qori ismaris (""One who rubs himself with a stick"") was a man who could transform himself into a ""Hyena-man"" by rubbing himself with a magic stick at nightfall and by repeating this process could return to his human state before dawn.  Trinidad and Tobago [ edit ]  The Ligahoo or loup-garou is the shapeshifter of Trinidad and Tobago's folklore. This unique ability is believed to be handed down in some old creole families, and is usually associated with witch-doctors and practitioners of African magic.[16] [17]  Mapuche (Argentina and Chile) [ edit ]  The name of the Nahuel Huapi Lake in Argentina derives from the toponym of its major island in Mapudungun (Mapuche language): ""Island of the Jaguar (or Puma)"", from nahuel, ""puma (or jaguar)"", and huapí, ""island"". There is, however, more to the word ""Nahuel"" - it can also signify ""a man who by sorcery has been transformed into a puma"" (or jaguar).  Folktales [ edit ]  Themes [ edit ]  Shapeshifting may be used as a plot device, such as when Puss in Boots in the fairy tales tricks the ogre into becoming a mouse to be eaten. Shapeshifting may also include symbolic significance, like the Beast's transformation in Beauty and the Beast indicates Belle's ability to accept him despite his appearance.  When a form is taken on involuntarily, the thematic effect can be one of confinement and restraint; the person is bound to the new form. In extreme cases, such as petrifaction, the character is entirely disabled. On the other hand, voluntary shapeshifting can be a means of escape and liberation. Even when the form is not undertaken to resemble a literal escape, the abilities specific to the form allow the character to act in a manner that was previously impossible.  Examples of this are in fairy tales. A prince who is forced into a bear's shape (as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon) is a prisoner, but a princess who takes on a bear's shape voluntarily to flee a situation (as in The She-Bear) escapes with her new shape.[22] In the Earthsea books, Ursula K. Le Guin depicts an animal form as slowly transforming the wizard's mind, so that the dolphin, bear or other creature forgets it was human, making it impossible to change back. This makes an example for a voluntary shapeshifting becoming an imprisoning metamorphosis. Beyond this, the uses of shapeshifting, transformation, and metamorphosis in fiction are as protean as the forms the characters take on. Some are rare, such as Italo Calvino's ""The Canary Prince"" is a Rapunzel variant in which shapeshifting is used to gain access to the tower.  Punitive changes [ edit ]  In many cases, imposed forms are punitive in nature. This may be a just punishment, the nature of the transformation matching the crime for which it occurs; in other cases, the form is unjustly imposed by an angry and powerful person. In fairy tales, such transformations are usually temporary, but they commonly appear as the resolution of myths (as in many of the Metamorphoses) or produce origin myths.  Transformation chase [ edit ]  In many fairy tales and ballads, as in Child Ballad #44, The Twa Magicians or Farmer Weathersky, a magical chase occurs where the pursued endlessly takes on forms in an effort to shake off the pursuer, and the pursuer answers with other shapeshifting, as, a dove is answered with a hawk, and a hare with a greyhound. The pursued may finally succeed in escape or the pursuer in capturing.  The Grimm Brothers fairy tale Foundling-Bird contains this as the bulk of the plot.[24] In the Italian Campania Fables collection of Pentamerone by Gianbattista Basile, tells of a Neapolitan princess who, to escape from her father who had imprisoned her, becomes in a huge she-bear. The magic happens due to a potion given to her by an old witch. The girl, once gone, can regain her human aspect.  In other variants, the pursued may transform various objects into obstacles, as in the fairy tale ""The Master Maid"", where the Master Maid transforms a wooden comb into a forest, a lump of salt into a mountain, and a flask of water into a sea. In these tales, the pursued normally escapes after overcoming three obstacles.[25] This obstacle chase is literally found worldwide, in many variants in every region.[26]  In fairy tales of the Aarne–Thompson type 313A, The Girl Helps the Hero Flee, such a chase is an integral part of the tale. It can be either a transformation chase (as in The Grateful Prince, King Kojata, Foundling-Bird, Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil's Daughter, or The Two Kings' Children) or an obstacle chase (as in The Battle of the Birds, The White Dove, or The Master Maid).[27]  In a similar effect, a captive may shapeshift in order to break a hold on him. Proteus and Nereus's shapeshifting was to prevent heroes such as Menelaus and Heracles from forcing information from them. Tam Lin, once seized by Janet, was transformed by the faeries to keep Janet from taking him, but as he had advised her, she did not let go, and so freed him.[29] The motif of capturing a person by holding him through many transformations is found in folktales throughout Europe,[7] and Patricia A. McKillip references it in her Riddle-Master trilogy: a shapeshifting Earthmaster finally wins its freedom by startling the man holding it.  Powers [ edit ]  One motif is a shape change in order to obtain abilities in the new form. Berserkers were held to change into wolves and bears in order to fight more effectively. In many cultures, evil magicians could transform into animal shapes and thus skulk about.  In many fairy tales, the hero's talking animal helper proves to be a shapeshifted human being, able to help him in its animal form. In one variation, featured in The Three Enchanted Princes and The Death of Koschei the Deathless, the hero's three sisters have been married to animals. These prove to be shapeshifted men, who aid their brother-in-law in a variant of tale types.[30]  In an early Mayan text, the Shapeshifter, or Mestaclocan, has the ability to change his appearance and to manipulate the minds of animals. In one tale, the Mestaclocan finds a dying eagle. Changing into the form of an eagle, he convinces the dying bird that it is, in fact, not dying. As the story goes they both soar into the heavens, and lived together for eternity.  Bildungsroman [ edit ]  Beauty and the Beast has been interpreted as a young woman's coming-of-age, in which she changes from being repulsed by sexual activity and regarding a husband therefore bestial, to a mature woman who can marry.  Needed items [ edit ]  Valkyries as swan maidens, having shed their swan skins.  Some shapeshifters are able to change form only if they have some item, usually an article of clothing. In Bisclavret by Marie de France, a werewolf cannot regain human form without his clothing, but in wolf form does no harm to anyone. The most common use of this motif, however, is in tales where a man steals the article and forces the shapeshifter, trapped in human form, to become his bride. This lasts until she discovers where he has hidden the article, and she can flee. Selkies feature in these tales. Others include swan maidens and the Japanese tennin.  Inner conflict [ edit ]  The power to externally transform can symbolize an internal savagery; a central theme in many strands of werewolf mythology, and the inversion of the ""liberation"" theme, as in Dr Jekyll's transformation into Mr. Hyde.  Usurpation [ edit ]  Sister Alenushka Weeping about Brother Ivanushka by Brother and Sister: Alenushka laments her brother's transformation into a goat. by Viktor Vasnetsov , Russian variant of: Alenushka laments her brother's transformation into a goat.  Some transformations are performed to remove the victim from his place, so that the transformer can usurp it. Bisclaveret's wife steals his clothing and traps him in wolf form because she has a lover. A witch, in The Wonderful Birch, changed a mother into a sheep to take her place, and had the mother slaughtered; when her stepdaughter married the king, the witch transformed her into a reindeer so as to put her daughter in the queen's place. In the Korean Transformation of the Kumiho, a kumiho, a fox with magical powers, transformed itself into an image of the bride, only being detected when her clothing is removed. In Brother and Sister, when two children flee their cruel stepmother, she enchants the streams along the way to transform them. While the brother refrains from the first two, which threaten to turn them into tigers and wolves, he is too thirsty at the third, which turns him into a deer. The Six Swans are transformed into swans by their stepmother, as are the Children of Lir in Irish mythology.  Ill-advised wishes [ edit ]  Many fairy-tale characters have expressed ill-advised wishes to have any child at all, even one that has another form, and had such children born to them.[34] At the end of the fairy tale, normally after marriage, such children metamorphose into human form. Hans My Hedgehog was born when his father wished for a child, even a hedgehog. Even stranger forms are possible: Giambattista Basile included in his Pentamerone the tale of a girl born as a sprig of myrtle, and Italo Calvino, in his Italian Folktales, a girl born as an apple.  Sometimes, the parent who wishes for a child is told how to gain one, but does not obey the directions perfectly, resulting in the transformed birth. In Prince Lindworm, the woman eats two onions, but does not peel one, resulting in her first child being a lindworm. In Tatterhood, a woman magically produces two flowers, but disobeys the directions to eat only the beautiful one, resulting her having a beautiful and sweet daughter, but only after a disgusting and hideous one.  Less commonly, ill-advised wishes can transform a person after birth. The Seven Ravens are transformed when their father thinks his sons are playing instead of fetching water to christen their newborn and sickly sister, and curses them.[35] In Puddocky, when three princes start to quarrel over the beautiful heroine, a witch curses her because of the noise.  Monstrous bride/bridegroom [ edit ]  Such wished-for children may become monstrous brides or bridegrooms. These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing arranged marriages; the bride's revulsion to marrying a stranger being symbolized by his bestial form.[36]  The heroine must fall in love with the transformed groom. The hero or heroine must marry, as promised, and the monstrous form is removed by the wedding. Sir Gawain thus transformed the Loathly lady; although he was told that this was half-way, she could at his choice be beautiful by day and hideous by night, or vice versa, he told her that he would choose what she preferred, which broke the spell entirely. In Tatterhood, Tatterhood is transformed by her asking her bridegroom why he didn't ask her why she rode a goat, why she carried a spoon, and why she was so ugly, and when he asked her, denying it and therefore transforming her goat into a horse, her spoon into a fan, and herself into a beauty. Puddocky is transformed when her prince, after she had helped him with two other tasks, tells him that his father has sent him for a bride. A similar effect is found in Child ballad 34, Kemp Owyne, where the hero can transform a dragon back into a maiden by kissing her three times.  Sometimes the bridegroom removes his animal skin for the wedding night, whereupon it can be burned. Hans My Hedgehog, The Donkey and The Pig King fall under this grouping. At an extreme, in Prince Lindworm, the bride who avoids being eaten by the lindworm bridegroom arrives at her wedding wearing every gown she owns, and she tells the bridegroom she will remove one of hers if he removes one of his; only when her last gown comes off has he removed his last skin, and become a white shape that she can form into a man.[1]  In some tales, the hero or heroine must obey a prohibition; the bride must spend a period of time not seeing the transformed groom in human shape (as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon), or the bridegroom must not burn the animals' skins. In The Brown Bear of Norway, The Golden Crab, The Enchanted Snake and some variants of The Frog Princess, burning the skin is a catastrophe, putting the transformed bride or bridegroom in danger. In these tales, the prohibition is broken, invariably, resulting in a separation and a search by one spouse for the other.[1]  Death [ edit ]  Ghosts sometimes appear in animal form. In The Famous Flower of Serving-Men, the heroine's murdered husband appears to the king as a white dove, lamenting her fate over his own grave. In The White and the Black Bride and The Three Little Men in the Wood, the murdered – drowned – true bride reappears as a white duck. In The Rose Tree and The Juniper Tree, the murdered children become birds who avenge their own deaths. There are African folk tales of murder victims avenging themselves in the form of crocodiles that can shapeshift into human form.[39]  In some fairy tales, the character can reveal himself in every new form, and so a usurper repeatedly kills the victim in every new form, as in Beauty and Pock Face, A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers, and The Boys with the Golden Stars. This eventually leads to a form in which the character (or characters) can reveal the truth to someone able to stop the villain.  Similarly, the transformation back may be acts that would be fatal. In The Wounded Lion, the prescription for turning the lion back into a prince was to kill him, chop him to pieces, burn the pieces, and throw the ash into water. Less drastic but no less apparently fatal, the fox in The Golden Bird, the foals in The Seven Foals, and the cats in Lord Peter and The White Cat tell the heroes of those stories to cut off their heads; this restores them to human shape.[40] In the Greek tale of Scylla, Scylla's father Nisus turns into an eagle after death and drowns her daughter for betraying her father.

"Jennifer Lawrence is an American actress who is best-known for her role as Katniss in The Hunger Games, but you might also know her from her role as Mystique in X-Men. She was once named one of the most influential people in the world back in the year 2013, but she has since been heard making some pretty questionable remarks that have people all over the world angry with her. Jennifer is known to be a very attractive young actress, but she hasn't exactly had the best of luck with men during her time in the spotlight, and that left us wondering what it is about this beautiful woman that has men running away faster than they could say bye.  RELATED: Jennifer Lawrence's Response To Brad Pitt Dating Rumors  It turns out that this actress is not nearly as wonderful as we once thought she was, but perhaps if she just lightened up a bit and decided to be comfortable with herself, maybe she wouldn’t be so bad. Even though she may be referred to as “America’s Sweetheart” in the media, people are starting to see past her sweetheart act and realized that a lot of the stuff that she says and does make her look like the exact opposite of a sweetheart. From her sketchy dating history to her not-so-nice comments, it is no wonder why men are steering clear. There have been many failed relationships throughout the years with the actress and after doing some research we have compiled a list of 15 reasons why she might just be every Hollywood man’s worst nightmare.  advertising  15 She Does Not Use Social Media  via: etonline.com  Social media has blown up over the years—it has just about taken over phone calls and texting, and just about everyone you know has it. There are even grandparents on Facebook using it as a way to communicate with their family. There are a ton of social media platforms out there that have taken over the lives of many people. For instance, Facebook has become the biggest social media platform that there is and it has done wonders for connecting people, but it has also been a huge relationship destroyer.  Although Jennifer Lawrence does have some social media accounts out there, she only ever uses them if she has absolutely no other choice. The actress has said that she hates the idea of social media and the people who use it, so obviously she does not want the men that she dates to be active social media users. This might not seem like a crazy request at first, but for people in Hollywood, social media plays a big part in how they market things. So, this could very easily be a reason why men aren’t too keen on Jennifer.  14 She Is Super Awkward  via: youtube.com  advertising  We all know how awkward dating and relationships can be, especially in the beginning before you really know the person that you are seeing, but sometimes that awkwardness doesn't go away after knowing each other for a while. Let’s be honest, most men don’t want to spend their lives with a woman who never gets comfortable with them or is unable to let loose.  RELATED: Times Jennifer Lawrence Was Too Much To Handle  For Jennifer Lawrence, dating is as awkward as it gets, romance is often times something that she laughs about, and intimacy is just downright weird to her. That’s not saying that she doesn't enjoy romance, but she definitely does not know how to take it seriously. How is a man supposed to take her out on a nice date or share an intimate moment with her, if she isn’t taking it seriously? Maybe this has played a role in her failed relationships thus far.  13 She Has A Long History Of Exes  via: metro.co.uk  If you are the average person, then you have probably had your fair share of ex-boyfriends or girlfriends. This is totally normal. After all, you don't want to just settle down with the first person that you meet. Instead, you want to see what's out there and make sure you are settling down with the right person for you. When you are under the spotlight, however, everyone tends to know your dating history.  When you are as popular as Jennifer Lawrence is, the people who you have dated are certainly not a secret, and things like how long you have been with someone, and just about every date you have ever gone on is no longer confidential. For instance, we know that Jennifer has dated Nicholas Hoult, Chris Martin, Liam Hemsworth, Darren Aronofsky, and Graham Martin, just to name a few. It is possible that news of who she has dated in the past, or how many people she has dated in the past, has had an impact on how other men in Hollywood feel about her.  12 She Wants To Jump Into Marriage  via: popsugar.com  advertising  Marriage is a sacred bond that two people enter into together and it usually does not happen until they have spent at least a couple of years getting to know one another. It is a very touchy subject to some people, mostly men because they do not want to feel rushed or pressured into having to commit to just one person for the rest of their lives. So, it is safe to say that marriage is usually a topic that you would hold off on until you have known each other for a long time and are nice and comfortable with one another.  Jennifer Lawrence must not have gotten that memo because, in an interview, she talked about how she would love to jump into a marriage. In fact, she said that she knows exactly what she wants in a man and that if she were to find that perfect man, she definitely would not hesitate to talk marriage. It is easy to see why news of this might scare away any potential boyfriends, especially Hollywood men, who are already so committed to their careers.  11 She Has Body Image Issues  via: giphy.com  Body image issues are something that almost all women struggle with today, especially when we feel as though we have to live up to the expectations set by female figures in Hollywood. So it may come as a surprise to some of you that Jennifer Lawrence struggles with these issues herself, for others though, it is quite obvious. Jennifer has said in interviews that in Hollywood, as an actress, she is considered to be obese. Apparently, you have to be super tiny to live up to that awesome Hollywood standard, but you would probably agree with us when we say that she looks great!  There have been some rumors circulating that she may or may not have an eating disorder, and she always seems to be shoving food in her mouth and joking about eating, but again, these are just rumors. Regardless of whether the rumors are true, no man likes it when a girl calls herself fat or doesn't see herself the way that they see her. Sometimes it can even take its toll on a relationship, so it is a strong possibility that men are leaving whenever they notice her bad habit.  10 Her Striking Good Looks Could Make Any Man Paranoid  via: pinterest.com  advertising  Despite the fact that Jennifer Lawrence does not see herself the way that most of us see her, we have to be honest and admit the fact that she is beautiful. One would think that men would be throwing themselves at her and that they would be super happy to say that they were able to land someone as hot as her, but that does not seem to be the case at all. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that they have self-image issues themselves, but it could also be that they are intimidated by how good-looking she is and do not find her approachable. Some men refuse to date women who are significantly more attractive than they are because they are afraid that it will make them look bad. This could most certainly be a big reason as to why she is ever Hollywood man’s worst nightmare when it comes to dating.  RELATED: Jennifer Lawrence's Hair And Makeup Evolution In Photos  9 She Wants Someone Who Does Not Know Who She Is  via: cnn.com  When you are an actor or actress in Hollywood and have starred in some pretty big name movies and shows like Jennifer has, then it is safe to say that you would be hard-pressed to go somewhere where no one knows who you are. Which is why it came as such a shocker when Jennifer Lawrence said that her ideal man would have no idea who she was. It is easy to see why she would like to meet someone who does not know who she is because when you are in the spotlight like she has been, rumors come out and everyone tends to think that they know everything about you when really they know nothing. However, if she is waiting to settle down with a guy until she does meet someone who does not know here, then she might be waiting for a very long time, possibly even forever.  advertising  8 She Is Extremely Successful  via: urnaija.com  advertising  When it comes to dating and relationships, there are a lot of men out there who like to be the successful ones in the relationship, mainly in terms of a career. This could be an issue for Jennifer Lawrence because of just how successful she is as an actress. Some men could find this to be a huge turn-off, or they could be intimidated by the fact that she is better off in her career than they are. There is nothing wrong with a little jealousy, but it is clear to see why some Hollywood men might find her to be a nightmare to date, especially if everyone is talking about her she is landing roles, while they seem to be having trouble landing roles themselves.  Of course, this does not speak for all Hollywood men, as there are men out there who are more successful than her, as well as men who do not become so easily jealous. However, this combined with all of her other little quirks, is definitely something that could drive men away before a first date would even take place.  7 She Is Always Lying  via: dailymail.co.uk  We all tell some white lies throughout our lives and usually, we are able to do this without anyone finding out or dealing with any repercussions. Lying is typically frowned upon, but let’s be honest here, who hasn’t said they were sick to get out of going to work or said that they loved the food that their mom cooked when really, it was atrocious? It is safe to say that everyone on earth has lied a good handful of times in their lives and sometimes we do it without even realizing that we are doing it. There are, however, people out there who take lying too far, and that is never a trait that someone wants in a significant other.  When you are someone like Jennifer Lawrence however, and just about every moment of your life is closely followed by almost the entire world, even the smallest lie is usually discovered. For instance, when Jennifer Lawrence told the world that she would be taking a year off of acting to focus on activism, it was really just her way of saying that she wanted to take a little time off before decided what movie to get into next but that she didn’t want to sound lazy for doing it. It was quickly discovered that she was not doing a single thing for activism and the articles about her many lies started to spread like wildfire.  6 She Is Very Intimidating  via: themarysue.com  advertising  There are plenty of strong, independent, and tough women out there these days. Some of these women are stronger than most men and could take them in a fight with no problem at all. While Jennifer Lawrence is not necessarily the strongest woman out there, she has been known to be able to stand up for herself and could take on a few guys she knows. The actress attributes this to the fact that she was raised in a house full of boys and was forbidden from playing with and making friends with all the girls in her neighborhood. This ultimately led her to take on more of a tomboy role in life, and she learned how to think, talk, and act like a boy. It also leads her to become quite competitive, and she definitely does not take any BS from anyone. With all of that being said, this is something that a lot of Hollywood men might find to be a huge turn-off because most of them want a more sweet and traditional female in their lives.  5 She Takes On Some Crazy Roles  via: youtube.com  Acting is a difficult talent to have, for some it comes naturally, but for others, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. It can be tough to fall into certain roles, especially the ones that you have no real life experiences to associate it with. Yet somehow, the acting in all the TV shows and movies that you see today is so believable in the final cut. If it were not for actors and actresses coming out and talking about how difficult it is in interviews, we would not know just how much work goes into portraying yourself as someone totally different.  Too bad the same can not be said for Jennifer Lawrence because, in the movies where she plays a totally crazy girl, she makes it look so believable that we started to question whether she was really acting or not. Maybe acting just comes that naturally to her, perhaps she is just so good that she can play any personality without any issues at all. However, she has mentioned that she loves playing the role of a crazy girl, and maybe that’s because she is a little crazy herself. This could be a pretty big reason why she is every Hollywood man’s worst nightmare.  4 She Runs Away When Things Get Real  via: isthismoviesuitable.com  advertising  There are two different types of people out there in the dating world — the ones who are ready to commit and be loyal, and then there are the ones who run at the first sight of anything too serious. Jennifer Lawrence just so happens to be the type that runs away from serious relationships. This may be hard to believe, seeing as how she has talked about being ready for marriage, but it is true. She has not taken a single one of her relationships seriously, and word has it that whenever even the slightest disagreement comes up, she runs away from the conversation and cuts her ties with that person instead of talking things out like a normal person would. It is obvious why this would be a turn-off for many men, and even more obvious as to why this would make her a nightmare for any Hollywood man.  3 She Is Against Feminism  via: rumorsfeed.com  Jennifer Lawrence has dubbed herself a full-on feminist, which is the cool thing to be in Hollywood these days, but actions speak louder than words, and her actions have certainly shown us differently over the years. Maybe it was the strict household that she lived in and growing up not being allowed to play with other girls that made her take gender roles more seriously than most. Jennifer Lawrence was told growing up that she was not allowed to play with other girls, and other than her mother, she was the only female in her household. She was taught to play rough with the boys, walk, talk, and act like a boy. So, maybe this is why she is so set in her ways when it comes to what a woman should and should not do, although some people might think that this should have made her grow into a woman who thought differently.  2 She Conforms To Gender Roles  via: youtube.com  advertising  Growing up, Jennifer Lawrence had quite a few brothers but no sisters. In fact, she and her mom were the only women in their household. She grew up watching her mom having dinner cooked and on the table, ready for her father when he would arrive home from work, and how she was expected to handle all of the cleaning, cooking, and children on her own. Of course, seeing her mom handle all of these things on her own probably should have made her realize that was not what she wanted for herself, or that any woman should have to conform to these basic gender roles, but instead she grew up believing that this way the way things should be, and she still thinks that way to this day. Of course, this will be a definite plus for anyone that she ends up marrying, but it is not how things should be.  1 Her Romantic Roles With Male Actors  via: independant.co.uk  Hollywood movies often times tend to be filled with passionate and intimate moments between an actor and actress, and although these are just scenes of two people acting, they often times do involve the two people being very close. This could be a problem in many Hollywood relationships, It can't be easy watching your partner be that up close and personal with another man or woman.  Jennifer Lawrence is certainly no stranger to these kinds of scenes and although she has admitted that she hates doing those scenes and finds them to awkward and weird, it could certainly play a role in any relationship that she enters into. After all, she is a very attractive woman, despite what she might think about herself. So, seeing her do these scenes with other just as attractive men could be very hard on someone that she is dating.

"HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas JeffersonELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.So, what gives?Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It’s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.And, now that they’ve been caught robbing the world’s largest bank – the U.S. treasury – they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.Washington’s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It’s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.EDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.HERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP“Impeach!” It’s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word – long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama’s administration – but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it’s back with a vengeance.Democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the “I” word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.Some members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked “Watergate.”Now the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.Wasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left’s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America’s new Richard Nixon.“Watergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,” says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. “Now, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I’m not going to stop asking them.”Meanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.The posters read: “If you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans’ tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. … Resign now.”But constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned “impeachment” enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?At this time, there’s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.“The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,” Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:For the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.However, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless “gotcha” announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.A good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the “due administration of justice.”However, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence “corruptly” when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term “corruptly” is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted “with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.” Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him..

Hoo boy, what an episode! The team goes to Paris this week for FOUR dates: two one-on-ones, a group date, and a two-on-one that finally wraps up what seemed like a never-ending hell-scape of a plot point. Krystal is eliminated, and on top of that, Jenna departs. But maybe most surprisingly, Chelsea doesn't receive a rose. Our sweet mama is excused. Let's review.  Arie Luyendyk Jr. continues to look for love. (Photo: PAUL HEBERT/ABC)  The Rundown!  You Like Cheese? Wow.  Lauren B is probably a great girl, but there's something about Laurens this season. Maybe it's that they have to carry the date for both Arie and herself. Maybe it's that they don't want to. Either way, when she and Arie end up at a street market, you can't help but notice that the date is painfully, awkwardly quiet. But this time, it's kind of hard to blame Lauren, because the conversation literally went:  ARIE: We see cheese like this at home.  LAUREN: Wow.  Lauren B is stunning but I may not be able to finish the rest of the episode because this date is putting me to sleeeeep #thebachelor — Christen Whitney (@Christen_mae_) February 6, 2018  That's not even a joke. But after all the painful silence, the date takes a turn when Arie talks about his previous girlfriend miscarrying their child and then immediately leaving him. Bachelor whiplash, y'all. In response, Lauren reveals she was engaged once, and if you're reading this and thinking ""those aren't similar stories,"" you're totally right. After mustering up some semblance of a personal anecdote, Lauren is gifted a rose anyway for simply managing to stay awake.  DATE PART ONE: *nothing*  DATE PART TWO: *nothing*  DATE PART THREE: My girlfriend got pregnant, then she lost the baby, and then she immediately left me.#TheBachelorpic.twitter.com/w4i7Biv4sH — Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) February 6, 2018  Moulin Rouge  The group date heads to the historic Moulin Rouge where they learn to dance. Seinne immediately shines and Bekah M loves the costume, because Bekah loves the drama of it all. But the costumes and dancing all leads to a challenge, and whoever wins gets to dance with Arie on stage, which sounds low-key terrifying.  I’m hiding in a hole now — Tia Booth (@tiarachel91) February 6, 2018  Tia locks in a real moment of connection with Arie, as does Seinne, who even drops a little bit of French on him because this is Paris, and Paris is sexy and romantic and vaguely exciting. It's Bekah M who lands the rose though and does a little dance number with Arie while the other girls contemplate ways to, you know, maybe kill her.  Krystal v Kindness  Krystal announces her and Kendall's two-on-one like an actual sociopath because intimidation is her game. They head to the French countryside and end up in a maze searching for him, like some twisted bougie white woman version of a horror movie. Krystal finds him, and honestly, I thank God because I wonder if Kendall would have survived if she had made it first.  Arie takes Krystal aside to talk about that little temper tantrum she had last week, which she totally flips around, eventually pivoting to how Kendall isn't emotionally available enough for a relationship. Arie immediately brings that up with Kendall, and girlfriend stays cool as a cucumber. When she gets back to Krystal, she very calmly tells her that she needs to let go of her hurt and insecurity because she's a good person who has just lost track of how to be good. It's either the most sympathetic gesture in history or a NEXT LEVEL DRAG.  Love love love Kendall moving towards and to Krystal in this setting and expressing empathy. So beautiful! Yes! #TheBachelor — Taylor Nolan (@taymocha) February 6, 2018  Arie decides that he doesn't have enough information, so he pushes his decision to dinner. Later, Krystal tries to explain her way out of the conversation, but Kendall maintains all composure. When the rose comes out, it doesn't go in the way of Krystal. Kendall stays and the reign of terror is over.  Jacqueline?  Every season there's a seemingly great girl who appears five weeks in, and you're like, ""Who's that? Jacqueline? Has she been here this whole time?"" She and Arie take off in a car and go shopping in Paris for her one-on-one, and the whole thing is unfortunate because she is well-spoken and pretty funny, and you know this can't last too long. But in the end, Arie gives her a rose and keeps her around, which is great... for now.  I'm super happy because I want good things for Jacqueline, but I also hope she loses because I want good things for Jacqueline. #TheBachelorpic.twitter.com/xI7oY6QT8N — Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) February 6, 2018  Superlatives!  Most Likely to Succeed  Kendall, who was easy to write off with all her sweet taxidermy talk, rose to the occasion on the Paris two-on-one date. With Krystal playing mad mind games on her, she leaned on the most powerful weapon of all: sincere kindness. By telling Krystal she was beautiful, but she was also imperfect like everyone else, Krystal went into dinner completely shaken while Kendall stayed completely composed.  Least Likely to Become a Rockette  Tia is handily a frontrunner this season, but that dance session? Well, poor girl couldn't carry choreography out if you put it in a bucket for her. Through a couple curse words and irresistible charm, she skates through the challenge, but man. Give the girl her frog legs and let her turn in those dance shoes.  Best Place to Start Over and Realize You Don't Need a Man  Tuscany, which is where the gang is headed next week!  More Recaps:  Krystal snaps on Arie, three women leave  Three dates, two eliminations, only one Krystal  A traumatic night for Annaleise, Bibiana, and Lauren S  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2BZ28im",0
"Keeping Up With the Kardashians season 15 was a labor of love for the famous family. “It’s like nursery school — there are so many babies!” Kris Jenner, 62, tells Us Weekly exclusively in the new issue. The momager was of course referring to her nine grandchildren.  The Kardashian-Jenner crew grew quite a bit in last few months. Kim Kardashian welcomed her third child — a daughter named Chicago — on January 15. Then Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian became first-time moms (They have daughters Stormi, 5 months, and True, 3 months, respectively.)  Kris marvels at how Kylie has adjusted to parenthood. “Kylie is more calm than I was,” she tells Us. “I look at the way she she loves Stormi and takes care of her. She doesn’t go anywhere without her.” The businesswoman is equally in awe of Khloe — through she never doubted the Good American denim cofounder’s mothering skills.  “I knew she would be amazing. She is always the one who has her house stocked with goodies and takes care of everyone else’s kids,” Kris gushes. “They all want to have the sleepovers at Auntie KoKo’s. True is the light of her life.”  Just before Khloe gave birth, videos and photos surfaced of her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, getting close with other women during her pregnancy. But fans might not see the drama play out on TV. “We’re focusing on baby and her life,” Kris explains. “I’m really proud of her for being an amazing mommy.”  Keeping Up With the Kardashians premieres on E! on Sunday, August 5, at 9 p.m.  For more on the Kardashians and season 15, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.

"For Suri Cruise, seeing Dad has been a mission impossible. Multiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly that Tom Cruise has had essentially ""no contact"" with the 10-year-old daughter he shares with ex-wife Katie Holmes.  ""Tom hasn't seen or even called Suri in about three years,"" claims a family source. Alleges another insider, ""Tom has no relationship with Suri.""  In fact, the last time Cruise, 54, and his youngest daughter were photographed publicly was in August 2012, when he took her to Disney's Typhoon Lagoon Water Park in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. (Cruise has two older children, Connor, 21, and Isabella, 23, with his second ex-wife, Nicole Kidman.)  Holmes, 37, and Cruise, a devout Scientologist, began dating in the spring of 2005 and announced their engagement that June. They welcomed Suri the following April, and tied the knot in front of more than 150 guests at a lavish wedding at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy, on November 18, 2006.  Six years later, in June 2012, Holmes filed for divorce. At the time, an insider told Us Holmes didn't want her daughter raised in Scientology and homeschooled by church teachers: ""She wanted Suri to go to a normal school with regular kids."" In the years since, NYC-based Holmes and Suri have since been “excommunicated” from Cruise's life because of his religion, according to the family source. (The insider adds that Cruise ""still sees"" Connor and Isabella, who are both church members.)  Many ex-Scientologists have claimed leaders force members to shun anyone who leaves the church. But a rep for the Church of Scientology tells Us, ""We never comment on individual parishioners' lives. On the issue of Church religious practices, we do not know who your anonymous sources are, but they got it all wrong. The answer to your question is no. Scientologists respect the faith of others, associate with and befriend members of every religion. Scientologists do not cut ties with non-Scientologist friends or family members because they have chosen another religion. Given that Scientology is a new religion, Scientologists often have family members and friends who are not Scientologists and who may practice another faith or no faith at all. This causes no conflict for Scientologists.""  Cruise’s rep had no comment.

"Fighting back. Renee Zellweger’s team is denouncing allegations that she had inappropriate encounters with Harvey Weinstein in order to escalate her career.  The claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing “sexual favors” for Weinstien, 65.  “If Harvey said that, he’s full of shit,” a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7.  Weinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: “Mr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them. It’s ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, Academy Award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work. It’s simply not true.”  As previously reported, the former Miramax producer made headlines in October after nearly 30 years of sexual assault and abuse allegations came to light in expośes published by The New York Times and The New Yorker. North of 60 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct to date and he has since been faced with several lawsuits and expelled from the Television Academy. The filmmaker spent a brief period of time in a sexual rehabilitation facility in Arizona after the allegations surfaced in October. The scandal has inspired more women to come forward with their own alleged accounts of sexual abuse in Hollywood.  Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him one week after NYT published its story. Alyssa Milano, who costarred as a judge alongside Chapman on Project Runway: All Stars, gave an update on the British fashion designer, 41, during an appearance on Megan Kelly Today on Wednesday, December 6.  “Georgina is doing very well. She’s an amazing mother. She’s an amazing woman,” the Charmed alum, 44, said. “I think her priority right now is focusing on how to raise those two children to the best of her capacity, given the situation. She goes through very dark times. She’s very sad. This is not easy for her, but I have no doubt that not only will she come out on the other side of this, but she deserves to. She’s a good woman.”  Chapman shares two children, India, 7, and Dashiell, 4, with Weinstein, who she wed in 2007.

"Taylor Swift laid low once again this Fourth of July, spending the holiday with her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.  Swift decided to forgo her once-beloved Independence Day party for the second year in a row, instead celebrating America's 242nd birthday by splashing around in the ocean with her British beau.  The 28-year-old Reputation artist still managed to show her patriotic side in a red, white, and blue stripped two-piece bikini while swimming and snorkeling with the 27-year-old actor.  The pair enjoyed the temperate climate and calm waters at a luxury resort in Turks and Caicos, where they made the most of their romantic vacation. They even got a little cozy in the surf as Swift rode on Alwyn's back through the idyllic blue waters.  SBMF / BACKGRID  The pair's cozy ocean romp was a rare public outing for the couple. Despite being romantically linked since last May, they've only been spotted out and about together a handful of times.  While the lovebirds enjoyed the quiet, romantic holiday in relative privacy, fans of the pop icon were left wondering if this marked the end of Swift's Fourth of July party tradition.  For years now, the singer and her squad of besties -- which included super models, singers, actress and social media stars -- all gathered at Swift's Rhode Island estate for FOMO-inducing festivities that included barbecues, fireworks, patriotic inflatable bouncy houses and more.  However, amid her prolonged break from the public eye in the months before Reputation's release in November -- as well as her highly publicized feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and taking heat for not being as vocal against President Donald Trump as some fans would have liked -- Swift also skipped last year's Fourth of July celebration.  As some fans have suggested, it's possible Swift -- like many celebrities -- simply hasn't felt like celebrating the patriotic holiday. Or maybe its because she has been gearing up for and then subsequently performing in her massive Reputation Stadium Tour, and simply hasn't had time or energy to throw together a massive party. Only Swift herself can answer those questions.  For more on Swift's epic Fourth of July celebrations of years' past, check out the video below.

"Brad Pitt can’t catch a break this year. It was recently revealed that the divorced actor is currently mourning the shocking loss of both Soundgarden rocker Chris Cornell and Paramount’s Brad Grey.  As Radar readers know, Cornell, 52, was found dead on the bathroom floor of his hotel room after an apparent suicide. Meanwhile, last weekend, Grey, the former Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO, died of cancer. He was just 59.  “He is devastated and in shock,” a source told E! News of Pitt’s reaction to the sad news. “He is trying to process the loss of two great friends. This has hit him very hard.”  PHOTOS: Manorexic? Skinny Brad Pitt Barely Fits Into His Suit On NYC Outing  “With Brad Grey, Brad Pitt was one of the few people who knew he was sick. Grey was told he had a few weeks to live, but he didn’t even get that long. He was gone way too soon,” the insider added.  Of course, Pitt has had his own issues to deal with in recent months.  Following his shocking split from Angelina Jolie, the 53-year-old kicked healthy living into high gear. Sources say the actor will do whatever it takes to win back the love of his ex-wife and six kids – even if that means giving up booze forever.  PHOTOS: Skinny Brad Pitt Caught Looking Exhausted After All-Night Sculpting Session  However, Pitt seems to be withering away in the process. “Brad showed up to a premiere looking gaunt,” a source confided. “Clearly, he’s losing sleep — and weight — over his split from Angelina Jolie.”  As previously reported, Pitt and Jolie, 41, split late last year after Pitt reportedly had a boozy breakdown on a private jet with his family.

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines  Congratulations to Chrissy Teigen and husband John Legend. The couple just welcomed their second child to the world.  And it's a boy!  Teigen made the announcement via Twitter overnight, and what her tweet lacked in details, it made up for in enthusiasm.  ""Somebody's herrrrrrre!"" she wrote.  The brief message was followed by baby and baby bottle emoji, and it was immediately retweeted by proud pop Legend.  The model mom and Grammy-winning musician first revealed they were expecting back in November — with a little help from baby No.1, their 2-year-old daughter Luna.  Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have welcomed their new arrival to the world. Victor Boyko / Getty Images  ""It's John's!"" Teigen hilariously captioned the video reveal.  In January, the 32-year-old revealed the sex of the new arrival by simply sharing a photo of her well-dressed baby bump from the Grammys red carpet with the words ""mama and her baby boy.""  Evan Agostini / AP  After that, Teigen remained candid about her pregnancy (and even about her ""pregnancy nose"").  And thanks to a sit down with TODAY in April, we know that she and Legend aren't the only ones who just welcomed a baby boy.  Teigen explained that Luna has a love of baby dolls, saying, ""She's always changing their little diapers and burping them."" So to mark Luna's transition into big sisterhood, she has a new addition of her own.  ""The day we have baby boy, she's going to receive her own little baby boy (doll) to take care of at the same time,"" Teigen told us.",0
"SPOILER ALERT: Do not read on unless you’ve seen Season 7, episode 2 of “American Horror Story,” titled “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” which aired on Sept. 12.  The premiere of “American Horror Story: Cult” found Ally (Sarah Paulson) to be, well, a mess after the election. As Donald Trump is voted into office, her old phobias rear their ugly heads once again, but in the second episode of the season, “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” it only gets much, much worse. In fact, her fears become fatal in the last shot of the episode, one of the most unsettling scenes yet.  But first, we pick up where we left off — with Ally in bed with one of the dreaded clowns. She screams and runs for Ivy (Alison Pill), who rushes to protect her and is as sweet and patient as ever. When she finds no such clown in the bedroom, however, despite Ally’s protests, Ivy admits again that Ally’s anxiety has taken its toll on her. Ally finally resigns to her state, saying, “I think there might be something wrong with me.” (But hey: Just because she’s paranoid, it doesn’t mean someone isn’t out to get her.)  Meanwhile, we see that Kai’s (Evan Peters) nefarious plans from the last episode have been working out swimmingly for him. After he provoked a band of construction workers by yelling racial slurs at them and chucking over a condom full of his urine, they unleashed a beatdown on him… while someone filmed on a cell phone nearby. Now it’s a local news story, and of course it takes a political turn: some of the construction workers have been taken into the custody of ICE. In announcing his run for city council — a seat that was vacated by the murder of councilman Chang — he quotes Trump’s “rapists and criminals” line, yelling, “Look at my face, Michigan!”  Related ‘American Horror Story: Cult’ Cast: Who’s Returning, Who’s Not, and Who’s New 10 Best ‘American Horror Story’ Episodes  Speaking of the Changs, the Mayfair-Richards already have new neighbors. After a rather creepy scene where Winter (Billie Lourd) engages in the most serious pinky swear ever with Oz, vowing to take his fear for him, she allows him to go next door to play with the new residents. Ally and Ivy get home and immediately freak out over this (how have they not fired Winter yet? Seriously?) and rush over to find Oz playing with bees. Yes, in a blatant reference to the “hive mind” theme of this season, one of the new neighbors is actually a beekeeper.  And this also means that Billy Eichner and Leslie Grossman’s characters have been revealed. Harrison and Meadow are married, but not a couple — in fact, Harrison is gay. They just got married based on a pact they made when they were younger. Harrison gets one night a week to go out on the town and satisfy his needs, while Meadow, because of her past case of skin cancer, doesn’t like to be touched, so it all works out pretty nicely for them. They’re a blunt pair, which takes Ivy and Ally aback, but Harrison notes that that’s just “the way of the world now.” Indeed, Harrison.  Ally — surprise! — is skeptical of them, especially of the mysterious barrels they keep at their home, and the fact that they moved into the Chang’s old house so soon after the murders. But she’ll soon learn that they’re the least of her worries. Something’s tripped the alarm system back at their restaurant, and though Ivy offers to go, Ally insists that she can and that she’s “got this.” One has the sense, however, that she does not, in fact, got this. When she gets there, she makes a gruesome discovery: one of her restaurant’s managers hanging from a meat hook, just barely alive. As we learn later, Ally had to be the one to kill him.  Unsurprisingly, there’s an investigation, but there’s a political twist now: a worker at the restaurant is a suspect, due to an argument with the deceased that turned weirdly racial at the top of the episode. When a police officer, played by “AHS” newcomer Colton Haynes, asks Ally and Ivy about his immigration status, Ivy indignantly insists that “he’s American.” Other repercussions of the murder, of course, lie in Ally’s psyche. She gets a gun from Harrison, who has a troubling stockpile of them as he started to collect them, in a sense, when Barack Obama became president. Harrison goads on Ally’s fears, telling her, it’s “the only thing that will make you feel safe again.”  Ivy, concerned, invites Ally’s therapist, Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson) for a home call. Here, Ally tells him that she feels “vindicated” by her phobias and that they keep her safe, which… is one way to go. “The world is f—ed up,” she tells him. “The election made it worse.” She shows him her new gun, and while he’s worried, he’s unable to tell Ivy because of doctor-patient confidentiality, Ally notes.  Later, after Ally’s fortified her house, she gets an unwelcome visit from Kai, who she best knows currently as the man who dumped coffee all over her and Ivy in the last episode. He’s making a visit to campaign for office, and in a chilling scene, we see right rhetoric v. left rhetoric in full form. Ally, ironically from behind her newly installed bars, tells Kai that she’s interested in “building bridges, not walls.” Kai asks if he can get a drink of water, and Ally refuses to let him in and threatens to call the cops. Crazed, Kai yells, “It’s so easy until it’s you they’re coming for!”  This does not help Ally’s mental status. Later, as Ivy’s gone at the restaurant, Ally stares reluctantly at her pills. Winter picks up on this — she encourages Ally to have some wine and a bath to unwind, instead of taking her medication. Winter goes so far as to draw a bath for her, and when Ally’s relaxing, she reappears. While Ally is surprised at first, Winter starts to help wash her off. It’s clearly a seduction technique, and it’s kind of genius: she knows Ally’s stressed, and therefore relaxes her into seduction. But nothing ruins the mood like crazed clown murderers.  Suddenly, the power goes out, and with it, so does Winter, exclaiming that she has to go home to save her laptop. Harrison appears at her window to yell one of the best lines of the episode: “Lesbians! We’re under attack!” It’s interesting that he goes political, telling Ally that it could be Russians or “those crazy freaks in North Korea,” seemingly playing on her fears. Ally panics and calls Ivy, who’s dealing with the power outage at the restaurant too. When Ally’s phone dies, Ivy sends Pedro — the employee currently under investigation for murder — with some supplies for her.  Meanwhile, Ally’s lost it. She finds that someone’s cut the cords in her fusebox, and even sees a few of the masked murderers. When she runs upstairs to grab Oz, she has to throw one off of from the top of the stairs (and though it could mean nothing, it’s worth noting: there’s no thump to be heard when the assailant hits the ground). With her gun in hand, she rushes Oz to the door and instructs him to run to the neighbors’ house. When she opens the door, however, someone’s standing there, and in her panic, she shoots him. But lo and behold, it was Pedro there to help her — and now, he could very well be dead.  Now, not only has Ally committed a murder and lost another friend, but my guess is Kai will try to use this to his advantage. Maybe his fear-mongering is working — on Ally, at least.",0
"James Corden may be able to sing karaoke, but it’s Halle Berry who just came out with the digs! On the Tuesday, October 24, premiere of TBS’ new sketch show, Drop the Mic, which pins two celebs up against each other in an epic rap battle, both Berry and Corden got in some personal digs.  It all began with Berry’s career choices. “Let’s not pretend that Catwoman didn’t suck. Halle, that was a Batman movie, how’d you mess that up?” Corden began. However, she was ready!  “I’m glad Swordfish was to your satisfaction. It’s probably the only time your d-ck has seen some action,” she rapped. “Yes, everybody knows Catwoman tanked, but I took Kingsman to the mother f-ckin’ bank… James has a Tony, that’s cool and all. But I have an Oscar, so suck my monster balls.”  From there, he got personal.  “Halle is a classic. This whole thing’s tragic. You’re just Viola Davis but not as charismatic,” he rapped. “Sure you won an Oscar but I question the voters. I use my Gothica DVD as a drink coaster… 2008 you were Sexiest Woman Alive. Was that a moment when Beyoncé briefly died?”  The late night host ended with the divorce jokes, while she ended with a sex dig.  “When it comes to getting married, three divorces is enough. Forget signing autographs. Sign a prenup,” he said. “You’ve done so many X-Men movies, maybe a dozen. I heard X-Men and I thought it was about your husbands.”  “Now, why are you so angry and pushy? Of course, you hated Catwoman you never get p–sy,” Berry said.  In the end, she was named the clear winner.  Drop the Mic airs on TBS on Tuesdays at 10:30 p.m. ET.

"The following story contains major spoilers about Homeland‘s Season 5 finale. Stop reading if the episode is still sitting on your DVR.  Homeland ended its fifth season Sunday with the presumed death of Rupert Friend’s Quinn.  His already-bleak condition took a turn for the worse when the super-sniper suffered a brain hemorrhage. Even if he was to recover, he would’ve been left with severe brain damage, his doc explained to Carrie. That prompted Carrie to remove his pulse monitor before — presumably — pulling the plug (or smothering him?) in the episode’s closing minutes. (Or did Quinn stop breathing on his own, as one reader noted in the comments below?) Earlier, Dar handed her the letter Quinn had written her at the end of last season on the off chance he didn’t survive that covert Syrian mission.  Here’s the full text of his heartbreaking farewell note:  Carrie. I guess I’m done. And we never happened. I’m not one for words, but they’re coming now. I don’t believe in fate, or destiny, or horoscopes, but I can’t say I’m surprised things turned out this way. I always thought there was something kind of pulling me back to darkness. But I wasn’t allowed a real life. Or a real love. That was for normal people. With you I thought maybe just maybe. But I know now that was a false glimmer. I’m used to… they happen all of the time in the desert, but this one got to me. And here’s the thing, this death, this end of me is exactly what should’ve happened. I wanted the darkness. I f—ing asked for it. And it has me now. So don’t put a star on the wall for me. Don’t say some dumb speech. Just think of me as a light on the heavens. A beacon. Steering you clear of the wrongs. I loved you. —Yours, for always now, Quinn.  (Quick sidebar: While it’s true we didn’t actually see Carrie pull the plug, given the extent of Quinn’s brain injury, Homeland would risk mass ridicule if it returned in Season 6 with Quinn still alive; he’s dead, people.)  Other highlights from Season 5’s final hour:  * The chemical weapons attack in the Berlin subway station was averted, thanks to Carrie and good samaritan Qasim (may he R.I.P.).  * Saul cut a deal with Ivan — witness protection in the U.S. in exchange for delivering the duplicitous Allison to him. He came through with his end of the bargain, pinpointing Allison’s whereabouts as she was being smuggled across the border in the trunk of a black sedan. The second the vehicle was in his sights, Saul ordered it fired upon; Allison was killed instantly.  RELATED ‘Homeland Is Racist’ Message Sneaks Into Season 5 Episode; EP Responds  * Laura and Numan were arrested by the BND for the role they played in stealing those sensitive documents. Astrid then floated a deal by Laura — publicly throw the late Marwan under the bus and, in return, her hacker buddy Numan won’t be deported. Laura reluctantly accepted it.

"Former ‘Dream Girl’ Jennifer Hudson has become an absolute nightmare for executives at NBC’s The Voice!  And now, as Hudson, 36, prepares to battle it out with coaches Miley Cyrus, 24, Adam Levine, 38, and Blake Shelton, 41, in hopes of winning season 13, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that she is ALSO at war with her bosses after being told that she is not welcomed back!  “The higher-ups at NBC told Jennifer that she needs to stop using The Voice platform to promote and plug JHud Productions,” a source close to production revealed.  But instead of following her bosses orders, Hudson fired back with a shocking Instagram post – plugging her production company while clearly seated in her judges chair on The Voice!  “Here at #Jhudproductions we take care of our own,” Hudson captioned the sassy photo.  “It is no longer a secret that there is mad drama behind the scenes. Jennifer is just a horrific person and the other coaches learned that best way to deal with her is just to avoid her,” the source told Radar.

"The first thing you’ll notice about the Dark Knight in Batman v. Superman, the second installation of the newly re-launched DC Universe, is that he’s gotten bigger in stature, muscle, and armor. The next? He’s also badder — gruff, aggressive, and the kind of character willing to square up to the Man of Steel. Given this, you might miss the third fact, that Batman — or at least Ben Affleck, the actor playing him — is also, well, middle-aged.  “I knew that a big part of the audience’s expectation around the role would be how I looked physically,” Affleck, now 43, tells Men’s Journal over email. “And that was something I had some control over. If I was going to fail in this role, I wasn’t going to let it be in a way that could have prevented if I had worked harder.” Director Zack Snyder believes that he got the job done, recently voicing his approval of Affleck’s portrayal as the iconic character, in both of his personas: “He’s an amazing Bruce Wayne, let’s just be frank about that. And then when he puts the cowl on, you know he’s got the chin for it.”  Affleck accomplished the proper frame with help from longtime trainer Walter Norton Jr., of the Institute of Performance and Fitness, who he began training with through a mutual friend during his fitness preparation for 2010’s The Town. Based in Boston, Norton makes almost weekly flights between his hometown and wherever Affleck is, whether it’s in Los Angeles or on location. “Getting ready for this role meant working hard, day in and day out with Walter,” says Affleck. “But it was the kind of work where I felt gains in not only my size, but also my mental and physical health.”  There are benefits of having history with a trainer. “Seven years ago the body bounced back a little quicker,” says Norton. “Like any relationship, it’s all about communication and honesty. I can tell him a little something that he doesn’t want to hear and that’s fine. We’re not tiptoeing around issues. So we just addressed it right at the top. We did what we needed to do to take care of him and protect his joints.”  But that does not mean that Affleck had it easy. Every week Norton created a new regime for him with specific goals, targeting each muscle group relentlessly, and with that mentality they found themselves even overachieving their target numbers. In context, Affleck weighed in at 198 pounds for The Town, and for Batman V. Superman, he went all the way to 231 at 7.7 percent body fat, which they ended up “dialing back” to 225. “This time around we did more bodybuilding. We wanted him to be strong but we wanted to add mass. The volume was higher. We lived on a lot of the basics, 80-pound dumbbell curls, heavy-loaded carries, and farmers walks with 60-pound weights.”  Affleck needed that extra strength on set: The batsuit weighs some 75 pounds. There are also plenty of workout scenes making their way into the final cut, showing off his ripped physique, like one he shot in the Batcave doing pull-ups, while strapped to an additional 50 pounds in weight. “If I had to say there were any critical exercises that we always went back to, it was pull-ups and chin-ups.”  “We wanted him to look like a thick MMA heavyweight puncher,” explains Norton. “This is a Bruce Wayne who’s been lifting for 20 years, hitting that heavyweight bag, and working out every day in the manor. I’ll just say that if you lined up all the Batmans before Ben and stood them next to each other, they’re not 6’4”, and they don’t weigh 225 pounds. He’s in a whole other class.”  Here’s a two-day glimpse at the workouts Norton created for Affleck as part of their two-year training program. You might not want to try this one on your own, though. “I recommend that people find a trainer who they get along with, create their own program suiting their own goals, and if they approach it with the same enthusiasm that Ben did, they can also make gains like a hero.”  Day 1:  Block 1 (32 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Elliptical (Strength Program): 15 minutes  Rumble Roller (Hip/TFL/VMO/2 Way Glute/Calf): 9 minutes  Plank with Arm Extension: 10 seconds (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Spiderman: From a plank, bring you right foot next to your right hand. 3 reps for each side (hold for 2 breaths)  Inchworm: From touching your toes with straight legs, walk your hands out to a plank, then walk your feet back under you, 5 reps (hold for 1 breath)  Calf Stretch: 15 seconds (each leg)  Block 2 (40 minutes): Torso & Strength  Dumbbell Farmer’s Walk: 4 walks with appropriate weight for 1 minute  Alternating Hanging Knee-Up: 11 reps (for each leg)  ½ Kneeling Row: Kneel on your right knee in front of a cable machine, row with your right arm, 4 sets of 12 reps on each side  Back Bridge: 2 reps of 15 second hold (5-second pause between)  Alternating Dumbbell Reverse Lunge: 8 reps (for each leg)  Pull-Up: 6 sets of 4 reps (hold for 4 seconds up and 4 seconds down)  Shoulder Bridge: 10-second hold (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Block 3 (22 minutes / Doing As Many Sets As Possible): Strength & Fitness  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 20 seconds  V-Grip Pulldown: 15 reps  Seated Row Handle Grip: 12 reps  Alternating Dumbbell Open Curl: 5 sets of 5 reps (each arm, then 5 reps together)  Goblet Squat: 8 reps  Lateral Squat: 6 reps (each side)  Day 2:  Block 1 (30 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 10 reps of 5 minutes at 75% (finish with 15-second sprint, then 45-second rest)    Soft Roller (Upper Back/Lat/Quad/Glute/Ham Junction): 8 minutes  Brettzel Stretch : 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Kneeling Lat: 1 rep each side (hold for 5 breaths)  ½ Kneeling Quad Stretch: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Brettzel: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Block 2 (32 minutes): Torso & Strength  Off-Bench Oblique Side Crunch: 8 reps dynamic (followed with hold for 8 seconds)  Valslide Body Slide: 4 sets of 12 reps  Dumbbell Lateral Raise: 4 sets of 12 reps  Back Bridge with March: Hold bridge for 8 seconds (then 4 knee raises on each leg)  Dumbbell Shrug: 5 sets of 6 reps  Rear Delt Machine: 4 sets of 15 reps  1 Leg Hip Lift : 3 sets of 8 reps for each side (hold for 2 seconds)  Tricep Pushdown: 4 sets of 10 heavy reps, then 10 lighter reps  Block 3 (36 minutes): Strength  Dumbbell Deadlift: 4 sets of 6 reps  Dumbbell Bench Press: 4 sets of 10 reps (count 3 seconds from up to down position)  Pec Fly: 4 sets of 12 reps  Ball Leg Curl: 4 sets of 6 reps (hold for 2 seconds)  Batman v Superman is in theaters March 25, 2016.  https://youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro%3Frel%3D0%26controls%3D0%26showinfo%3D0",0
"AMANPOUR: Madam Speaker, thank you so much for joining me.PELOSI: My pleasure.AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about some of the important news that's been made this week, particularly in -- in the House and that would be on Afghanistan.Last year, 32 Democrats voted against the funding of the war in Afghanistan. This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal.PlayPELOSI: Well, not quite. You have to put the votes in perspective.Our president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes.I persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan.PlayAMANPOUR: Now, you didn't vote.PELOSI: No.AMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote.PELOSI: Right.AMANPOUR: But how would you have voted?PELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view.PlayAMANPOUR: How long do you think you can keep your skeptical members, as you call them, on side?PELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people?Is it worth it?AMANPOUR: Well, is it worth it?PELOSI: Yes.AMANPOUR: Is it worth it?PELOSI: That's the question.AMANPOUR: But that's my question to you.PELOSI: Well, we will -- as I said, we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year.AMANPOUR: But what does your gut tell you?PELOSI: in my visits to afghanistan, the last time i was there was over mother's day weekend to visit the troops///and the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security. And the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely.Secondly, governance and ending corruption.....AMANPOUR: I'm just trying to figure out, for instance, you know, what you think is the right thing to do in Afghanistan at the moment. Look, ""Time"" magazine, this week, has this as its cover -- a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the Taliban.You know, to put it right down to its basics, is America going to abandon the women of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan again?PELOSI: Well, first of all, we're in Afghanistan because it's in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security, to stop terrorism, to increase global security. The women of Afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in Congress -- and men, too, but the women have taken a special interest.When I was there in -- around Mother's Day, I went to a province in Southern Afghanistan and visited with women.And we talked about the education of their children, the health of women and the rest. And they -- especially their daughters.- they said we want that, but that can't happen without security. And these women in this remote province told us and that can't happen without the end of corruption.So what we would like to see is for President Karzai be a more reliable, a stronger partner, ending the corruption, increasing -- improving the governanceAMANPOUR: Vice President Biden, talking about the dead line for the transition, which is summer of 2011, he said on this program a week or two ago that there's going to be a drawdown of forcesBIDEN SOT--- ""it could be as few as a couple thousand troops it could be more. but there will be a transition""Does that square with -- with what you think, that it could just be a couple of thousand troops?PELOSI: Well, I hope it is more than that. I know it's not going to be turn out the lights and let's all go home on one day. But I do think the American people expect it to be somewhere between that and a -- a few thousand troops.AMANPOUR: Let's go to something much closer to home right now at the moment and that is the ethics conundrum with Representative Rangel.How does your affection and your respect for him as a colleague square with what's going on right now and what you said and declared, that this is going to be the -- the -- the most ethical Congress ---- that you're going to drain the swamp of any kind of wrongdoing and corruption, etc.?PELOSI: When I came in, I said we're draining the swamp. And we did. We have passed the most sweeping ethics reform in the history of the Congress. Any personal respect and affection we may have for people makes us sad about the course of events, but we have to pull the high ethical standard and none of our personalities is more important than that.AMANPOUR: Can you see Congressman Rangel ever returning as chairman of the Ways and Means or in any position of leadership in -- in the House?PELOSI: Well, the -- the Ethics Committee is working its will andAMANPOUR: No matter what happens?PELOSI: it's an elementary discussion, because what we have done is to wait and see what the Committee decides. I respect what they do. I'm totally out of the loop. It is independent. It is confidential, classified, secret, whatever. We don't know what it is. But we do respect the work that the members of the Committee do.AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the mid-term elections. You are, by all accounts, one of the most -- if not the most -- powerful and successful speakers of -- in the history of the United States. You've passed so much legislation. The president was elected with a significant majority.You had control of both houses of Congress. And yet now, people are talking about you might lose your majority in the House. The gap seems to be growing wider between what's achieved and what's making an impact with the people. How did this happen?PELOSI: Well, that's one version of the story. And --(CROSSTALK)from outsiders perspective....AMANPOUR: -- because many people are asking that --PELOSI: Yes.AMANPOUR: ... how did you get to this place where, perhaps, you might lose your majority?PELOSI: We don't see it that way. We are very proud of the agenda that we have put forth to the American people. our recovery package, as the economists have said, we've had twice as many people unemployed as there are now if we had not moved forward. These actions are all controversial because we were digging our way out of a deep ditch.so we've been legislating for the past 18 months. The other side has been in campaign mode for 18 months, saying no, stopping job creation and the rest. But our members are the best salespersons for their own districts. They've been elected there. They know their constituents.AMANPOUR: Are you nervous about November?PELOSI: No, I'm not nervous at all --AMANPOUR: Not at all?PELOSI: No. I'm -- I'm --AMANPOUR: Because people say I know you're putting on a great face --has you have toPELOSI: -- that's not.AMANPOUR: -- going into an election. But people say there's been considerable worry about what will happen in November.PELOSI: Well, let me say this. I never take anything for granted. And our agenda now is we're not going forward -- we're not going back to the failed policies of the Bush administration. We're going forward.AMANPOUR: So what does it make you feel, then, when the president's own spokesman said that you might lose the majority?PELOSI: Well, I -- you know, I --AMANPOUR: well how do you feel about itPELOSI: -- with all due respect -- I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what the president's employees say about one thing or another.AMANPOUR: But it directly impacts --PELOSI: Well, the -- they must realize that.But you know what, I'm speaker of the House. I have a great chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Chris Van Hollen. We have a solid plan of messaging and mobilize -- mobilizing at the grassroots level and management of our campaigns. And we have a two to one advantage money-wiseSo we feel very confident about where we are, whether that's well known to that gentleman or not.AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the tax cuts.Are you going to take that issue to -- to a fight before the elections, letting the tax cuts for the -- for the two -- 250,000 expire and then keep them on for the middle class?PELOSI: Well, the -- the tax cuts for the wealthiest -- of the $250,000 and above -- were the -- the Bush initiative. I dont see any reason why we should renew a tax cut that only gives a tax cut to the wealthiest people in America, increases the deficit and doesn't create jobs.That doesn't make any sense.AMANPOUR: But I know that's your position, butPELOSI: YesAMANPOUR: -- to the middle class --PELOSI: But to keep the middle class tax cuts--AMANPOUR: Would you take this to a vote before the electionPELOSI: It would be my hope. But let me just say, on The Recovery Act, nearly $300 billion of The Recovery Act were tax cuts for the middle class. most people dont realize thatThe Republicans want to have the tax cut and they want it unpaid for -- $700 billion added to the deficit for an initiative that does not create jobs.AMANPOUR: Can I show you something?PELOSI: Sure.AMANPOUR: there's so much polarization, so much partisanship, so much -- not just amongst the politicians, but in the press, amongst the people. You talked a little bit about what, you know, us and them, in your view. I want to show you this, which is a Republican commercial.TV AD//RIGHTCHANGE.COM (TAKE VIDEO CLIP FULL) AD NATSAMANPOUR: Oh, you haven't seen it?PELOSI: I have not seen that, but I have seen that in campaigns there isAMANPOUR: So what do you think --AMANPOUR: -- you being the -- the bogeyman?PELOSI: Well,-- what I know about that is that they tried this. This is their campaign in Pennsylvania 12, the 12th Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Their whole campaign was an attack on the president and on -- on Pelosi.AMANPOUR but it was youPELOSI: ...... and I said to to the president i think they may have gotten more focus here than you for this one time. And they fully expected to win the race and we won by 8.5 points. Because this is funny, it attracts attention, but they have nothing to say about what they want to go for, what they want to do is privatize Social Security. And as they have said, their agenda, if they win, is to go to the exact agenda of the previous administration and people will look with fondness on the Bush administration....we welcome that campaignAMANPOUR: -- for me, looking in from outside, it just seems -- that's seems to be a never-ending partisanship. What is it you can do for the people in this highly polarized situation.PELOSI well first of all, what you define as, you describe as a highly polarized situation is a very big difference of opinion. The Republicans are here for the special interests, we're here for the people's interests. The president said we will measure our progress, our success, by the progress that is made by America's working families. That is our priority. That is not their priority.This isn't about inter-party bickering. This is about a major philosophical difference as to whose side you're on. You don't like to think that. We come here to find our common ground. That's our responsibility. But if we can't find it, we still have to move. I've never voted for a perfect bill in my life. I don't think anyone has I wish it were not so stark. I wish the elections weren't so necessary for us to win. I really do, because it should be -- there should be more common ground. Are we unhappy that our not -- the -- the job creation has not gone as fast as we would like? Well, we were digging out of a very deep hole. But we will continue to fight.AMANPOUR: Speaker Pelosi, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.PELOSI: Well, I look forward to welcoming you back soon again. And congratulations to you and much success.AMANPOUR: Thank you.AMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you very much for joining us and welcome to ""This Week"".GATES: Thank you.AMANPOUR: Let's start with WikiLeaks.How can an ordinary soldier sitting at his computer, apparently listening to Lady Gaga or whatever, spew all this stuff out with nobody knowing?GATES: It's -- it's an -- it's an interesting question, because had -- had he tried to do this or had whoever did this tried to do it at a -- a rear headquarters, overseas or in pretty much anywhere here in the U.S., we have controls in place that would have allowed us to detect it. But one of the changes that has happened as we have fought these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been an effort to put the -- put as much information and intelligence as far forward to the soldiers as we possibly can, so that at a forward operating base, they -- they know what the security risks are to them and they -- and they also have information to help them accomplish their mission.So -- so we put an enormous amount of information out at a -- at the secret level and push it the furthest forward possible. And so it is this -- it -- it was much easier to do in theater and in Afghanistan or Iraq than it would have been at a rear headquarters or here in the U.S.AMANPOUR: So do you now have to reassess that -- much less intelligence going to the forward bases?GATES: I think we have to look at it, although I must say, my bias is that if one or a few members of the military did this, the notion that we would handicap our soldiers on the front lines by denying them information in an effort to try and prevent this from happening -- my bias is against that. I want those kids out there to have all the information they can have.And so we're going to look at are there ways in which we can mitigate the risk, but without denying the forward soldiers the information.AMANPOUR: How angry were you -- beyond the fact that classified information is out there -- the substance of it?GATES: Well, I'm not sure anger is the right word. I just -- I think mortified, appalled. And -- and if -- if I'm angry, it is -- it is because I believe that this information puts those in Afghanistan who have helped us at risk. It puts our soldiers at risk because they can learn a lot -- our adversaries can learn a lot about our techniques, tactics and procedures from the body of these leaked documents. And so I think that's what puts our soldiers at risk.And -- and then, as I say, our sources. And, you know, growing up in the intelligence business, protecting your sources is sacrosanct. And -- and there was no sense of responsibility or accountability associated with it.AMANPOUR: You know, you talk about putting your sources at risk, a Taliban spokesman has told a British news organization that they are, indeed, going to go after any of those names that they find in this treasure trove of documents and they will, as they say, they know how to deal with people.Are you worried?I mean Admiral Mullen said that this leak basically has blood on its hands?GATES: Well, I mean given the Taliban's statement, I think it -- it basically proves the point. And my attitude on this is that there are two -- two areas of culpability. One is legal culpability. And that's up to the Justice Department and others. That's not my arena. But there's also a moral culpability. And that's where I think the verdict is guilty on WikiLeaks. They have put this out without any regard whatsoever for the consequences.AMANPOUR: So let me ask you about a couple of things that came out. One is the possibility that the Taliban may have Stinger missiles.Do they, do you think?GATES: I don't think so.AMANPOUR: At all?GATES: I don't think so.AMANPOUR: The other is about Pakistan. Again raising the notion that Pakistan, no matter how much you say they're, you know, moving in your direction, helping with this fight against the Taliban and against al Qaeda, that they still are hedging their bets, that elements in Pakistan continue to hedge their bets or out and out support the Taliban and what they're doing in Afghanistan.How much of a problem is that for you?GATES: Well, it -- it is a concern, there's no question about it. But -- but I would say that, again, we walked out on Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1989 and left them basically holding the bag. And -- and there is always the fear that we will do that again. And I believe that's the reason there's a certain hedge.But what I see is a change in the strategic calculus in Pakistan. As they see these groups attacking Pakistan itself, where they are more and more partnering with us and working with us and fighting these insurgents and 140,000 soldiers in Northwestern Pakistan fighting some of the same insurgents we are.AMANPOUR: Right. But they're basically fighting the insurgents that are threatening them. They haven't gone into, for instance, these safe havens which still exist, Northern Waziristan. And General Jones, the national security adviser, has told ""The Washington Post"" that these safe havens are a big question mark in terms of our success rate.So unless they do that, cut off those safe havens, will you succeed in Afghanistan?GATES: Well, I think we can but --AMANPOUR: Even if the safe havens --GATES: -- but we clearly --AMANPOUR: -- exist?GATES: -- we clearly would like for them to go after the safe havens. But they have gone after the safe haven -- some of the safe havens, in South Waziristan and Swat and elsewhere, places where, 18 months ago, I wouldn't have believed the Pakistanis would be actively engaged -- and militarily.And so the Pakistanis going after any of these groups, I believe, overall, helps us in what we're trying to accomplish, both with respect to Afghanistan and with respect to al Qaeda.AMANPOUR: But given the way the war is going right now and given the fact that the Taliban are very wily and very adaptable enemies and they do have a place where they can go across the border and hide, can you afford to wait for the Pakistanis to -- to move on into Northern Waziristan?GATES: I think that the -- first of all, we are increasing our cooperation with the Pakistanis in terms of working on both sides of the border, in terms of trying to prevent people from crossing that border. We are increasing our forces in Eastern Afghanistan that will help us do this. So I think that -- I think we're moving in the right direction here.AMANPOUR: But you don't have an open-ended period of time. The president has clearly said that the summer of 2011 is a period of transition. And many people are interpreting that in all sorts of different ways, as you know.The Taliban is clearly running out the clock -- it's trying to run out the clock.Let me put something up that David Kilcullen, the counter-insurgency expert, a former adviser to General Petraeus, said about the timetable.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID KILCULLEN: They believe that we had stated a date certain, that we were going to leave in the summer of 2011. And they immediately went out and spoke to the population and said, the Americans are leaving in 18 months, as it was then. What are you doing on the 19th month? Who are you backing? Because we'll still be there and they won't be.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: So that question is out there. So many people are arranging their schedules for 2011 -- the summer of 2011.But my question to you is this, what can General Petraeus do to defeat the Taliban at their own game?What can he do now in Afghanistan to avoid this deadline that they're setting for themselves?GATES: Well, first of all, I think we need to re-emphasize the message that we are not leaving Afghanistan in July of 2011. We are beginning a transition process and a thinning of our ranks that will -- and the pace will depend on the conditions on the ground. The president has been very clear about that. And if the Taliban are waiting for the nineteenth month, I welcome that, because we will be there in the nineteenth month and we will be there with a lot of troops. So I think that --AMANPOUR: But what is a lot of troops?GATES: Well, first of all, I think that -- my personal opinion is that -- that drawdowns early on will be of fairly limited numbers. And as we are successful, we'll probably accelerate. But, again, it's -- it will depend on the conditions on the ground.AMANPOUR: Is there any way now -- between now and December, between now and next -- next summer, to deliver some high profile, real reconstruction, real sort of progress to them to make everybody know that you're serious and to change the dynamic? GATES: Well, first of all, I think we're already seeing that. We're already seeing it in Central Helmand, where security development and governance, economic returning. We are seeing it in places like Nad Ali. We're actually seeing it in places like Marjah, that has been slower and tougher than we anticipated, but it's getting better every day. And we're seeing it in gradually improving security in the area around Kandahar. It's going to take some time. It's going to be tough. We're going to take casualties. We have warned about this for months, that this summer would be very difficult for us. But I think there are tangible signs that this approach is working, this strategy is working. But the key thing to remember is the full surge isn't even all I Afghanistan yet and will not be until the end of August. So this surge over the last few months is only beginning to take effect. AMANPOUR: What I think a lot of people maybe don't get is that the Afghan people still want the American forces there. In the latest ABC poll, it shows that 68 percent of the Afghan people actually want the American forces still there.Do you think that there has been an opportunity missed or should there be an opportunity seized by yourself, maybe by the president, to go out and speak to the American people more about -- about Afghanistan, about the strategy, about why it's important?GATES: Well, first of all, I'm here. And I think the president has been out and has spoken about this. He talked about it in some detail at the time he nominated General Petraeus, about where we were headed.Probably we can do more. But Secretary Clinton and I and the president and the vice president and General Jones have all been out and -- and talking about this. And -- and I think -- you know, frankly, one of the things that I find frustrating is that I think that the president's strategy is really quite clear. I hear -- I hear all the stories that say what's the strategy, what's the goal here?I think it's quite clear. It's to -- it's to reverse the momentum of the Taliban, deny them control of populated areas, degrade their capabilities at the same time we're building up the Afghan security forces, so that the Afghan security forces can deny the Taliban and al Qaeda a base from which to attack the United States and the West.AMANPOUR: All right.GATES: It's pretty straightforward.AMANPOUR: OK. Then let me -- since you brought that up, I want to bring up what Vice President Biden told NBC earlier this week about the strategy and about -- about the aims, because, again, I think the American people and many people are confused about what is the -- what is winning, what is the strategy right now?Let me put that up.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are in Afghanistan for one express purpose -- al Qaeda. The threat to the United States -- al Qaeda that exists in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are not there to nation-build.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: Is that it?GATES: That's good.AMANPOUR: Is that the war?GATES: I agree with that. We are not there to -- to take on a nationwide reconstruction or construction project in Afghanistan. What we have to do is focus our efforts on those civilian aspects and governance to help us accomplish our se -- our security objective.We are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan, not because we want to try and -- and build a better society in Afghanistan.But doing things to improve governance, to improve development in Afghanistan, to the degree it contributes to our security mission and to the effectiveness of the Afghan government in the security arena, that's what we're going to do.AMANPOUR: A final question, do you think the way out is to strike a deal with the Taliban?GATES: I think that the -- I think that the way out is to improve the security situation in Afghanistan to the point -- and to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government -- detaching themselves from al Qaeda, agreeing that -- to under -- abide by the Afghan constitution, agreeing to put down their weapons. I think those are the -- those are the conditions that -- that need to -- reconciliation must take -- must be the end game here. But it must take place on the terms of the Afghan government.AMANPOUR: And you think that can happen in -- in a year?GATES: Well, we're not limited to a year. I think that it can happen in the time frame that we're looking at ahead. Again, July 2011 is not the end. It is the beginning of a transition.AMANPOUR: Secretary Gates, thank you so much for joining us.GATES: Thanks a lot.AMANPOUR: Thank you.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(UNKNOWN): Wikileaks, along with three major newspapers, has published 92,000 classified intelligence documents, the largest leak in history.GIBBS: There are names. There are operations. There's logistics. It poses a very real and potential threat.(UNKNOWN): I'm a combative person, so I wanted (inaudible)MULLEN: The truth is, they might already have on their hands the blood of some young soldier or that of an Afghan family.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: Highlights from the Wikileaks story that's really shaken up Washington and capitals around the world. We'll talk about that and more on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, and in Madrid this morning, Ahmed Rashid, the Pakistani journalist who is the world authority on the Taliban.Thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me go to you first, George. What about this leak? How bad is it for the war effort? And how bad is it for a government which really has to reassess what it does with state secrets?WILL: Well, these were lethal without being helpful, lethal in the sense that they compromised both methods and, more important, sources themselves. Not helping, in the sense that they're not a bit like the Pentagon Papers, which showed in the Vietnam War that the government internally had a very different understanding of what was going on in Vietnam than it was saying publicly.That's not the case here. These are redundant anecdotes about what we all knew from good journalism and honest government about this.What we're left with now is still the question of the mission. In your interview with Secretary Gates, he said the following: ""We are in Afghanistan because we were attacked from Afghanistan."" Notice the preposition. We weren't attacked by Afghanistan, in the sense that we were attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor. We were attacked from there.And National Security Adviser James Jones has said that we have to be there because otherwise the terrorists would have more space to plot and train.AMANPOUR: Exactly.WILL: We were attacked from Hamburg, in a sense. You can plot in this kind of war anywhere.AMANPOUR: Well, yes, but the real ground war is in Afghanistan.And let me go to Ahmed Rashid, who is the authority on the Taliban. Ahmed, what is your assessment of how Wikileaks and all the material and information that came out of that could affect the war?RASHID: Well, again, I don't think that there has been any really major new information given in these Wikileaks. The impact has been quite extraordinary in America, in Europe, and other places simply because this war has not really been properly followed by the public.The media has not followed it. And as a result, I think people are being quite shocked about the degree of detail and content that have come out. But I don't think anything drastically new has come out. Now there is a risk of sources, et cetera, which the Taliban are going to follow up on.AMANPOUR: Precisely. And I wanted to ask you about that. You know already they have said that they're going to be searching and scouring this treasure trove. Do you -- do you foresee that there are going to be bodies turning up in Afghanistan amongst people who've really been helping the United States?RASHID: Well, I hope that, you know, these -- a lot of these leaks are quite old, and people have moved on. A lot of the names may be false names. I hope we're not going to see bodies, but certainly this is something -- the Taliban are extremely good at following debates in the West, the Western media, debates in parliaments in Europe, in the Congress. They will have seen this new vote just now, where so many of the Democrats seem to be voting against the war.They are expert now at following up. And if there are people to be followed up upon, they will do so.AMANPOUR: Well, let me put that to Donna Brazile and to Paul Krugman. The idea that they are really smart, they read the Western press, they have a very highly sophisticated, whether we like to think that or not, media operation.BRAZILE: Well, it put the Afghanistan war back on the front page, the longest war in United States' history. Voters are weary of this war right now. Congress is -- is worried about the funding, the strategy.I think this will give the administration an opportunity to once again talk about the mission, before December, when the president has announced that he intends to reassess what they're doing.I also think it raises a serious question about Pakistan's involvement with the Taliban and also whether or not Mr. Karzai is still up to the job of bringing the government together, reinforcing the police and the army. It raises a serious question about going forward and the timetable.KRUGMAN: You know, when I look at this, people say, you know, we can't abandon Afghanistan, all that. I'm surprised that people aren't pointing out that basically the decision to abandon Afghanistan was taken eight years ago, right? Eight years ago, when the Taliban was on the run, when it might have been possible to really use the momentum to change this, that's when the Bush administration pulled the troops out of Afghanistan, pulled the resources away, because they wanted to invade Iraq instead.And now you're asking us to -- you're asking Obama to recover from a situation where we've spent eight years losing credibility.AMANPOUR: But the thing is, he is trying to recover. He's had this big strategy. He's made a surge in Afghanistan. And right now, for instance, Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard has written a memo to President Obama, basically saying rescind the 2011 -- the 2011 deadline. What do you think has to happen to make this war winnable for the United States?WILL: Well, first of all, in his remarks to you, Secretary Gates semi-rescinded it, by saying that, in fact, what comes in July '11 -- 2011 is fairly limited numbers of withdrawal. That's making it a fairly elastic deadline.But look what -- and our friend in Madrid can comment on this. Secretary Gates said to you today, our purpose is to degrade the Taliban to a degree where they are willing to consider reconciliation on the terms of the Afghan government. Now, that, A, sounds like surrender, and, B, the normal Afghan would say, ""Give me a third choice, because I don't like the Afghan government, either.""AMANPOUR: Right. Ahmed Rashid, how did you read that, that the Taliban is expected to surrender or come into a reconciliation on the terms of the Karzai government?RASHID: Well, I think this is going to be the very big debate that takes place within the Obama administration come December, when the policy review takes place, because the other position to this is that, in fact, the U.S. should start talks with the Taliban as soon as possible, and that will then trigger up much better attempts to try and bring about a regional cohesion, a regional alliance to support those talks.The Taliban, with all their interlocutors that they've been talking to so far, have made it clear that they want to talk to the Americans directly. Now, any such talks can't be based on conditions set by America, as Gates has just done. They would have to be free and open talks, and they would have to continue for some time.So I think once you have a dialogue going with the Taliban, then you, I think, can go to the Pakistanis and the ISI and tell them, ""Now, look, we're talking to the Taliban. This is the end game now. The surges will continue. Talks will continue. But you now have to give a deadline for the end of these safe havens for the Taliban leaders.""In other words, the Taliban leaders should know that their safe havens will only have a limited timeframe and negotiations will also have a limited timeframe.AMANPOUR: Well, lots and lots to talk about on this particular issue, but let's move on a little bit. I actually asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi about Afghanistan, about the war vote, the war funding vote in the House, and whether she thought that the president needed to come out and speak more to the country about Afghanistan. This is what she said to me. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PELOSI: They're worried about their economic security, and that's what they want to hear from the president, is how we can increase -- create jobs in our country as we reduce the deficit.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: So there you have it. Economic security, obviously, is the number-one preoccupation, as it always would be wherever there is these huge problems of unemployment. There is a huge debate right now, all leading economists basically disagree on how and what effect stimulus has had, what it means for future economic policy. Is it deficit reduction austerity? Is it more stimulus? Where do we go and what does it mean to people?KRUGMAN: Well, what it means to people, I think, is a lot of confusion, which is -- which is a problem, right? They're not hearing any clear message.You know, the way I look at it is that there are two sides in this debate -- I call them inflationistas and deflationistas -- that were -- one side, the inflationistas, have said, ""Oh, god, we have this -- we have budget deficits. The Fed is printing money. We're going to have inflation. Interest rates are going to go sky-high.""The deflationistas have said, you know, that we've had a major financial crisis. In the fact of that, the Obama stimulus plan is too small, interest rates are going to stay low because nobody wants to spend, the -- you know, that the risk is deflation.So far, the deflationistas have been totally right. What's interesting is that the political debate is being dominated by the people who've been wrong about everything up to this point, who said, well, you know, actually, interest rates are lower. They just hit a -- more than a year low just now.But they keep on saying, oh, but it's any day now. We've got to be afraid of those people who aren't visible in the markets and so on.But this is a -- there is this problem that people have got this austerity notion in their mind, not based on anything that's actually happening, but based upon this hypothetical notion and because it appeals to people who just feel that there has to be some reason to make people suffer even more.AMANPOUR: Let me put up this graphic, talking about the gross domestic product of the second quarter. Growth is happening, but at 2.4 percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shaking your head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect.You're shaking your head.WILL: Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we know two things about it. It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons.First of all, the stimulus is running out. Paul's right about this. Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax credit for purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone.Second, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories, businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer -- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back to the malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent.So what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift.KRUGMAN: Exactly.WILL: It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue.BRAZILE: Well, I'm not the resident economist on the panel, clearly, but what's happening, Christiane, is that we're not creating jobs. The economy is -- is -- is not creating enough jobs. Unemployment remains high. The Democrats will have to campaign on the promise that the policies that they've put forward thus far has averted the Great Depression 2.0.And going forward, this is a choice between going back to the past, going back to Bush-onomics, or going forward with a path toward economic growth, which brings us back to the Bush tax cuts and -- and whether or not the -- the Congress will -- will just let them expire in January or let some of them stay on the table.AMANPOUR: Well, you heard what I asked Speaker Pelosi, and she said she hoped that this would come to a resolution before the -- before the midterms. Is that likely?BRAZILE: Well, I don't think so. I mean, look, Congress on the House side, they're away for six weeks. They're going out. They're going to campaign on what they've accomplished.But I think when they return, they're going to have to turn back toward the budget, turn toward the economy, and once again convince the voters out there that they've done something to provide economic growth for the future.KRUGMAN: Just wanted to say, George, it's exactly what I would have done in describing it. The forces for growth are fading out. We're not looking good going forward. This is very difficult. It's very hard for an administration in power to run on the campaign slogan, ""It could have been worse,"" and that is essentially -- and it's true. It actually could have been a lot worse, but -- but that doesn't sell very well.AMANPOUR: Can I...WILL: Lest it be thought that Paul and I agree on something, let me...AMANPOUR: Well, you might. Maybe this is a rarity today.WILL: No, this is not the case, because Paul thinks the government is dangerously frugal at this point, and I do not think so. I side with people like Kenneth Rogoff at Harvard who say there is time for austerity, and this is it.KRUGMAN: Well, you know, we can...AMANPOUR: That's happening in Europe, as you know...(CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: That's -- yes, I think Ken Rogoff is doing some damage here with some pretty bad statistics. But...AMANPOUR: Can I -- can I move over to Madrid again and ask Ahmed about this economy, because it obviously clearly impacts what's happening in -- in America's foreign policy, as well. What do people in Pakistan, who've been promised so much aid by the United States -- does this even figure in their debates when they look at the U.S., the fact that the money is shorter?RASHID: Oh, it does very much. I mean, I think really people are fully aware that the continuation of the American presence in Afghanistan and the aid to Pakistan is dependent, is hostage, if you like, to whether the American economy picks up or not, especially in the autumn, when the surge will be completed, the troop surge will be completed, a very critical moment will appear when Obama has to decide what his next six-months, one-year policy is going to be in the policy review.And all of this probably is going to be dominated by how effective or uneffective the American economy is doing. I mean, we've seen the vote in Congress now. I mean, what happens in three months' time if the vote in Congress is even more lopsided and more Democrats turn against the war?AMANPOUR: That is indeed a big question. Let us move on, though, right now -- and I want to move on to something else that the Democrats made a huge, big deal about when they came in, and that was to have an ethical Congress, to have a -- you know, drain the swamp, as many people said. This is what President Obama said just in the last couple of days over the travails of Representative Charlie Rangel.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I think Charlie Rangel served a very long time and served his constituents very well, but these allegations are very troubling. And, you know, he's somebody who's at the end of his career, 80 years old. I'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with dignity, and my hope is, is that happens.(END VIDEO CLIP)BRAZILE: It would be politically expedient for Mr. Rangel to just step down and resign, but he's not the kind of lawmaker that would do that. These are serious allegations, and Mr. Rangel would like to have his day up on the Hill to defend himself, defend his honor, and answer to some of these charges.Again, it's easy to drain the swamp if you have some type of Drano, but it's clogged up, and I think Mr. Rangel and others would like to have their day to clear their names.AMANPOUR: What about the president making that pretty...KRUGMAN: Yes, well, they...AMANPOUR: ... dismissive statement?KRUGMAN: No, I think it's fair enough. But, you know, let me ask -- there's something I don't understand about this whole thing. There are actually two major investigations of members of Congress underway right now. There's Charlie Rangel, who's accused of some fairly petty, although stupid and wrong, ethical violations, and there's Senator John Ensign, who's facing a criminal investigation and which actually -- it's even a story that involves sex. And you get no publicity whatsoever on the Ensign investigation.Why is Rangel getting all this attention?AMANPOUR: Is that fair, George?WILL: Well, Rangel is much more important, because he's chairman of an important committee. And in fact, Rangel's misfortune is a national misfortune, because we desperately need -- and after the deficit commission reports in December, we might have had -- serious tax reform in this country. That requires a cooperative member leading that committee in the House.(CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: Nothing's -- nothing's going to happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)KRUGMAN: If there's actually anything to come out of the deficit commission, it would matter, but it's not.WILL: ... as Rostenkowski was with Ronald Reagan's tax reform. Now, Rangel has a weak position, but a very -- a weak case, but a strong position. His strong position is the president and everyone wants this thing over with so the Democrats won't be tarred with this, and therefore he can hold out for some minor reprimand -- indeed, a reprimand, technically -- just to liquidate this and get out of here.KRUGMAN: In a way, he's sort of the Hamid Karzai of the U.S. Congress.AMANPOUR: Well, I was going to -- we only have 15 seconds left, but I was going to ask Ahmed Rashid what they make of all of this, given so much corruption charges over there. Ahmed, we're out of time, but thank you all so much for joining us.And the roundtable continues in the green room on abcnews.com, where later you can also find our fact checks.

"Kim Kardashian recently revealed that she and hubby, Kanye West, would like to have more children so that daughter North and son Saint will grow up with lots of siblings.

"Signup to receive a daily roundup of the top LGBT+ news stories from around the world  George Michael opened up about struggling with the death of his first serious boyfriend in his final interview.  The Wham! legend was filming a programme for Channel 4 in the UK when he died suddenly on Christmas Day 2016.  He finished compiling the documentary less than 36 hours before he died.  In the voiceover for the programme he said he felt “picked on my god” during his life.  Freedom, directed by George and his friend David Austin, chronicles the making of the 1990 album Listen Without Prejudice and the subsequent legal battle with his record label.  In a harrowing twist, the story of his life, now released posthumously, is narrated by George himself.  He recalls the death of his first love, Brazilian Anselmo Feleppa, who died of an AIDS related illness in 1993.  “It was the most frightening time of my life,” George says in the documentary.  “I was terrified of losing him. He was my saviour. Finding a companion at that time in my life changed me.”  He later says: “Then when my mum got cancer, I felt so bloody picked on by God.  “I took it very badly, very badly indeed. I’ve never felt that kind of depression.”  The pair met in a hotel lobby when they fell in love almost immediately.  The Mirror says of the programme: “George speaks very movingly about Anselmo being the first love of his life and how important he was in his life.  “It is very emotional and he clearly never forgot him and left a huge ­impression on George.”  RELATED: Woman gives birth to baby thanks to secret IVF donation by George Michael  The first trailer for the show, released last week, hears George describe how he was “terribly lonely” during the height of his stardom.  The film includes contributions from a long list of his friends and associates, including his neighbour Kate Moss.  Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Ricky Gervais, Nile Rogers, Mark Ronson, Tracey Emin, Mary J. Blige, Jean Paul Gaultier, James Corden, Tony Bennett and Liam Gallagher also feature in the film.  Gallagher labels the late singer, who he had become friends with in his final years, a “modern day Elvis”.  His final song, a re-worked version of his 80s song Fantasy, was released last week with music producer Nile Rogers.

"Jolie redirects here. For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation)  Angelina Jolie ( joh-LEE; born Angelina Jolie Voight, June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).  Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17]  As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21]  Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[9] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[24] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[25] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[26] They did not speak for six-and-a-half years,[27] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[26][28] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[26]  Career  1991–1997: Early work  Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[12] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[11]  Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[12] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[29] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[30]  After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[31] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[32]  In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[33] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[34] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[35]  1998–2000: Breakthrough  Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[36] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.  Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[37] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.  In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[38] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[12] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[9] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[12]  Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[39] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.  In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[40] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[41] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[42]  ""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[43]  Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[44] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[45]  In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[41] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[46] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.  2001–2004: Mainstream recognition  Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[47] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[41] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.  Alexander in December 2004 Jolie at the Cologne premiere ofin December 2004  Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[48] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[49] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[17] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[50]  Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[41] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[51] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[52]  The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[53] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[49] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[54] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[41]  2005–2010: Commercial success  In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[55] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[41][56]  Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[57] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[58] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[59] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[41]  By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[60][61] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[62] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[41] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[63]  Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007  Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[64] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[65] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).  After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[66] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[41] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[67]  Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[68] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[41] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[69] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[70][71]  2011–present: Professional expansion  After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[72] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[73] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[74] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[75] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[76]  After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[77] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[78] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[79] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[41][80]  Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[81] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[82] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[82][83] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[84] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[85][86] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[84][87] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[88] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[89]  Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[90][91] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[92] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[90]  As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[93] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel, Maleficent II.[94]  Humanitarian work  UNHCR ambassadorship  ""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[95]  Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[96] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[95] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[95]  In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[97][98] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[99] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[95] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[100]  Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[101] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[97] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.  Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[102] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[103] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[104] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[105] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[106] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[103] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[17][107] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[108][109][110]  On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[111] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[112] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[113] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[101][114]  Conservation and community development  In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[115] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[116]  In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[117] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[115] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[115]  After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[118] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[119] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[120][121][122] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[123]  Child immigration and education  Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[100][124] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[100] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[125] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[126] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[124][127]  Ms., in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage Jolie on the cover of, in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage  Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[128] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[128] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[129] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[130] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[131] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[132]  Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[133] which opened in 2005,[134] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[135][136] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[137] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[117] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[138]  Human rights and women's rights  British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Jolie at the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in May 2012  After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[139] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[114][125] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[140] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[141] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[140][141][142]  Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[143] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[144] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[143] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[145] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[143] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[146] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[147] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[148]  Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[149] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[150] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[148]  Recognition and honors  Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[151] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[152] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[153] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[154] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[155]  In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[156][157] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[158][159] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[160]  Personal life  Relationships and marriages  Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[161] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[162]  During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[12] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[163] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[16] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[164][165]  Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[166] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[167] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[168]  After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[165] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[169] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[170] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[17]  Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[171] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[168] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[172]  During their twelve-year relationship, ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[173] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[174] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[175] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[176] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[177] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[178] On June 6, 2018, a new temporary custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt after the court's order against Jolie.[179]  Children  On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[180] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[24] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[181] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[182] in a local village.[16] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[183] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[183] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[184] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[183] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[170][185] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[170][186]  Changeling in May 2008 A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere ofin May 2008  Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[187][188] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[189][190] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[191] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[192] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[189] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[187] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[193] having first visited the country earlier that year.[194] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[195] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[190] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[196]  In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[173] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[197] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[196] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[198] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[199]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[200] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[201] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[200] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[202] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[203]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[204] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[205]  Cancer prevention treatment  On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[206] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[207][208] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[209] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[207] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[208]  ""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[206]  After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[206][208][210] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[206]  Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[211] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[212] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[213] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[214] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[215] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[215][216][217] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[218][219][220] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[215] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[221] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[222][223]  In the media  Public image  As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[23] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[224] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[224][225] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[225] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[12] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[226] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[12]  Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[100] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[100] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[100] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[227] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[228] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[229] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[230][231]  Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[232] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[233][234] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[235][236] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[237][238] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[69][239][240]  Appearance  A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolie at the New York premiere ofin June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible  Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[241] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[242] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[243] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[244][245] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children.[246] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[244]  Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[247][248] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[249] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[49] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[250]  Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[251] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[252] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[253][254] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[255][256] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[214]  Filmography  Awards and nominations  Honorary Dame Commander (DCMG), Order of St Michael and St George (2014)  See also",0
"Just one week after making history at the box office, “Wonder Woman” has been given the Oprah Winfrey treatment. The media empress threw a “Wonder Woman”-themed party on Tuesday, complete with a cake, flip-flops, popcorn buckets and the superhero’s signature headpiece and wrist cuffs.  Winfrey documented the party preparations on her Instagram account with a series of videos. “It’s ‘Wonder Woman’ day at my house,” she declared in the first, adding, “I’m having a party for 28 10-year-olds.” She proceeded to outfit a “Wonder Woman” cake with a topper featuring the superhero herself.  By the second video, Winfrey had entered full fangirl mode, going so far as to place the “Wonder Woman” headpiece on her own head. She’s also wearing the signature wrist cuffs as she raves about themed popcorn buckets and cups. She then displays pairs of “Wonder Woman” flip-flops, capping off her video series with a shot of the chef preparing some salad.  “Wonder Woman” raked in a whopping $223 million globally when it opened two weeks ago, making it the biggest opening for a film directed by a woman. Starring Gal Gadot, the film has garnered both high-end and mass-market appeal. Luxury brands such as Givenchy and Louis Vuitton along with mass-market retailers like Hot Topic and Kohl’s have all created products inspired by the 75-year-old character.  “Wonder Woman is a pioneer in many ways including being a fashion icon,” says Soo Koo, Warner Bros. Consumer Products’ chief creative officer. “These collections celebrate her as an iconic superhero and empower fans of all kinds to be confident and strong.”  Judging from Winfrey’s Instagram videos, this much is clear: She, too, seems to have fallen prey to the “Wonder Woman” mass-market bug.

"FILE - In this Jan. 11, 2018 file photo, Katie Couric poses in the press room at the 23rd annual Critics' Choice Awards in Santa Monica, Calif. Couric and leaders of household consumer products maker Procter & Gamble highlight a forum planned to examine the state of women in the workplace. P&G and Seneca Women, which advocates for global female advancement, are co-hosting the #WeSeeEqual forum Thursday at the company’s Cincinnati headquarters. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)  CINCINNATI (AP) — Veteran TV journalist Katie Couric recounted Thursday facing demeaning descriptions and “gross comments” during her career.  Couric spoke at consumer products maker Procter & Gamble’s Cincinnati headquarters in a forum on the state of women in the workplace. The #WeSeeEqual forum took place amid a wave of sexual misconduct claims against prominent figures in entertainment, politics and the media — including her former NBC “Today Show” co-host, Matt Lauer.  “I’ve been very fortunate in terms of not being subjected to a lot of sexual misconduct, but certainly I have been subjected to widely held attitudes about women, about compartmentalizing women,” Couric said when asked about career obstacles by Carolyn Tastad, president of P&G’s North America business group, in the forum’s keynote discussion.  Couric cited the frequent descriptions of her as “cute” and “perky,” which she found “marginalizing.” She joked that on her tombstone, it will say “Perky No More.”  She also recalled public critiques of her clothing when she began hosting “CBS Evening News,” and a jarring moment early in her career when she walked into a meeting at CNN and an executive said of her to others around the table: “She’s successful because of her hard work, intelligence and breast size.”  Couric said with support from her supervisor, a male anchor, she wrote to the executive and he soon called her, “dripping with apologies.”  Couric described the #MeToo movement as like “a long-dormant volcano that’s erupting” and said it’s important for men to be part of open discussions on gender issues, on how to make things better. But she said she thinks it “just feels almost too red-hot” for some to have such discussions publicly yet.  Couric has said she had been unaware of the misconduct allegations that led to Lauer’s ouster last year.  ___  Follow Dan Sewell at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell",0
"Have We Reached the End of Our 3,600 Word Jelena Timeline?  So. Much. Drama.  Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we’re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that’s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.  The two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.  Their relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we’ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there’s a lot to dive into.  photography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall  January 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia  Bieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010.

However, it’s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren’t true.  photography via pinterest  November 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin  Don’t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups.

Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it’s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they’ve since broken up.  photography via instagram.com/sofiarichie  August 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber  Yes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan. The comments on both their accounts proved one thing for sure: do not mess with Jelena fans.  Photography via Instagram.com/selenagomez  August 2016: Gomez posts a clip of her singing “Let Me Love You”  So, just when we thought the dust had settled between Jelena, this clip surfaced of Gomez singing DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You,” which features the Biebs on vocals. An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it’s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez’s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it’s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex’s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!  photography via instagram.com/revivaltour  November 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab  Gomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate. Can somebody seriously loop us in, please?!  Photography by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images  January 2017: Gomez and The Weeknd spotted together  The 24-year-old songstress was spotted making out with Canadian singer The Weeknd in photographs released by TMZ. According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were “getting handsy and mouthy” outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.  Photography by Charley Gallay/AMA2015/Getty Images for dcp  February 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud  While out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd’s music, to which he responded with a simple “Hell, no.” Fast forward to Valentine’s Day, when a track called “Some Way” by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. “I think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,” the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: “She say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.” Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo’s single “It Ain’t Me” drops, featuring Gomez, and let’s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.  Photography via Instagram/_marissamarino  April 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track  The Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled “Bad Girlfriend.” The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it’s “…about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.” One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: “I know I’m not there for you or there when you call. I’m a bad girlfriend/I’m a bad girlfriend.” So. Much. Shade.  Photography via Instagram/selenagomez  May 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram  Last week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words “Bad Liar” scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.  June 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.  During an interview on Sirius XM’s Morning Mash Up, ​Selena was asked ​to share ​her thoughts on Ariana Grande’s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert​. Turns out ​she had nothing but ​good things to say about the performers, including Justin.  “It was beautiful,” says Selena. “I thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.” Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.  JELENA IS RISING AGAIN YOU GUYS pic.twitter.com/ea9zylAaSZ — rip jelena 2010-2018 (@thorsodn) June 5, 2017  Photography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage  June 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud  The two recorded an incomplete single called “Steal Our Love” back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.  “I can’t seem to choose what to do / There’s nothing I can say / I’m tired of the fight ’cause I’m never right / I just wanna cry, no,” Selena allegedly sings.  Sounds familiar?  Photography via Instagram/@justinbieber  August 2017: Justin releases a new song titled “Friends”  “Can we still be friends?” Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He’s singing to to an ex who he swears he’s over but can’t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he’s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm…could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?  Photography via Twitter/@heardtroye  August 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena’s Instagram  With 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena’s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez’s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.  The explicit photos posted aren’t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star’s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn’t make it okay—we should never look a someone’s naked body without their consent.  October 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez’s home  Looks like Bieber’s song “Friends” really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend’s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena’s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she’d undergone a kidney transplant. All’s well that ends well!  October 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together  It was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena’s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!  October 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED  Sound the alarms! According to a source via People, the “Sorry” singer is “happy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.” According to Bieber’s “close friend”/wingman, “It seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.” Maybe Justin’s song “Friends” wasn’t about Selena after all…  November 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy  Well these two aren’t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They’re biking, they’re laughing, they’re nuzzling into one another, and it’s ALL going down in front of photographers. It’s not PDA, but it’s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.  November 2017: Selena wears Justin’s hockey jersey  Selena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq — Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017  Okay, so it’s not a PDA social media post — but it’s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber’s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn’t the ‘borrowed-from-a-boy’ look the international indicator of love?  November 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again  Guess it’s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber 💕 #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST    This is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin’s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.  November 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram  📱| Justin Bieber liked this photo of Selena on Instagram pic.twitter.com/gvo1ZnDKr4 — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Justin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz — Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017  Trouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (“Their whole relationship in a nutshell,” remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn’t actually posted on Gomez’s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn’t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the ‘gram for pics of his lady.  In other news, the “Wolves” songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the “Follow” button on each others’ accounts. Stay tuned.  December 2017: Justin is asked if he’ll propose to Selena  Justin Bieber Smiles, Blushes When Asked If He'll Propose to Selena Gomez https://t.co/ad4u4sGJ3f — TMZ (@TMZ) December 6, 2017  In a video captured by TMZ , a paparazzi is heard asking Justin if he plans to get down on one knee to propose to Selena. The Biebs didn’t get a straight answer, but he did flash a wide grin and blush at the question as he got into his car. That’s something, right?  December 2017: Justin and Selena will spend Christmas apart  According to a recent report from People, Gomez’s family is less than supportive about her reunion with Bieber, and won’t be inviting him their family Christmas. “Justin’s family always loved Selena,” a source told the Magazine, “but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin.” Selena, on the other hand, will always be welcome in Stratford, Ontario: “I’ve met her and we have a special bond, so I think she’s precious,” Beiber’s mom, Pattie Mallete, gushed to People over the weekend.  December 2017: Biebs and Selena share a drink at the Sugar Factory  They may not be spending *actual* Christmas together, but Justin and Selena are making sure to enjoy each other’s company pre-holiday festivities. According to TMZ, Jelena went on a date at the Sugar Factory, sharing a (non-alcoholic) drink called the Ocean Blue. How romantic!  Selena Gomez’s mom was reportedly hospitalized after a fight about Justin Bieber  Photography via Getty  Selena’s mom, Mandy Teefey, was voluntarily transported for treatment to a L.A. hospital last week after having a “heated” chat with Selena about her relationship with Justin, TMZ has reported. According to a source, Selena revealed to her mom that the on-again-off-again pair were in couples therapy, leading her to realize “the relationship was going to be more long-term.” The two later unfollowed each other on Instagram.  December 2017: Jelena reportedly in couples therapy because of a fight over Hailey Baldwin  A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 3, 2016 at 4:12pm PST  The drama continues! TMZ reports Jelena is in Christian’s couples therapy after the pair had a fight over Justin’s ex, Hailey Baldwin. According to sources connected to Hillsong Church, Bieber has been trying to make amends with Baldwin to “clear the air over their brief relationship and sour breakup.” He informed Selena of the the convo, which didn’t go over too well, resulting in the pair going to therapy.  January 2018: Justin poses on Instagram with a tree  Now I know what Love is A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 16, 2018 at 7:45pm PST  Trouble in paradise? While vacationing somewhere tropical, Justin posted a photo cuddling up to a palm tree with the caption, “Now I know what Love is.” Fans panicked: What does this mean? Did he not know what love was like when he was with Selena? Does he love the tree more than Selena? J-14 is convinced the caption is about his love for Jesus. (Interesting.)  February 2018: Jelena spotted making out amidst break-up rumours  just seen Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez cuddling in the middle of the street:))) — Hennessy ✨ (@hennessyysilvaa) February 9, 2018  Phew! No worries Jelena stans, the couple is going strong. When Bieber and Gomez attended the Rex Orange County show in Los Angeles, one fan got footage of what appears to be them cuddling in the street, while several others tweeted about seeing the two after the show. Here’s hoping the duo share their Valentine’s Day plans with the rest of us, and that they finally make things Insta-official?  February 2018: The pair indulge in a Laguna Beach Valentine’s staycation  Photography via Instagram/@TheJBCrewdotcom  With Gomez in New York for Fashion Week, it appears that the newly reunited couple won’t be spending Valentine’s Day together. But don’t fret Jelena stans! Because from the looks of things, Gomez and Bieber enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast this past weekend in celebration of the holiday. TMZ reports that the duo were hanging poolside at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach on Sunday, where they were spotted taking romantic beach walks and taking in the view.  February 2018: Jelena heads to Jamaica for a family wedding  Bieber and Gomez have landed in the Caribbean for a wedding — but don’t freak out yet, because it’s not their own. Justin’s dad Jeremy is tying the knot in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo, and the “Sorry” singer is bringing along Selena as his plus one. It’s a pretty big relationship step to take someone as a date to your parent’s destination wedding, right? These two are just as serious as we thought.  March 2018: Selena Gomez posts a b-day tribute to her boo  This is the moment we’ve been waiting for! It’s not the PDA-filled couple selfie we were hoping for, but at least it’s something! It’s sweet, subtle — and kind of meta? It’s a photo of a photo of Selena Gomez with a photo of Justin Bieber on her forehead. The caption: “March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.” Well said. There’s no better birthday gift than an Insta-official relationship.  March 2018: Sources say Jelena is taking time apart  Just six days after making their relationship Instagram official, rumours have started circulating that the on-again couple are taking a break. An unnamed source told E! that after spending so much time together in Jamaica, Gomez and Bieber “were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight in particular blew up and caused them to decide to ‘break up.’ However they’ve been in contact the entire time and their feelings for each other have not changed.”  But don’t worry too much Jelena shippers: “They will absolutely get back together and they are not over,” says the source, “but they both need some time away from each other.”  March 2018: Justin Bieber is spotted hanging out with another woman  Photography via Instagram/@floor8official  To cope with the break, Selena Gomez has taken off to Australia with her ukelele. Bieber has another approach to heartbreak: hang out with a beautiful blonde Sport’s Illustrated model. According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger’s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David’s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his “arm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.”  March 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits — for good  Grab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena’s “break” has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now,” a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren’t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)  Fans think Gomez’s latest outfit — a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, “Never underestimate the power of a woman” — is hinting at the heartbreak. But hey, this could very well be message for all men!  April 2018: Sources say Justin wants Selena back  Not all hope is lost! According to a new report from People, Bieber desperately wants Gomez to take him back.“He loves her. He wants her back,” the source says, adding he “misses” Gomez. Can these two please just let us know what’s up? This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.  May 2018: Selena has apparently “completely moved on”  Have we reached the end of our lover’s saga? Multiple sources have told E! News that Gomez is over Bieber and not interested in rekindling their romance any time soon. “She respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing.,” said one insider to E! Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.” So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?  June 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again  Ahhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.  July 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged  After just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.“Everyone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin’s security told everyone to put their phones away,” two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, “because something special was about to happen.”  Have we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline? After seven years of drama, maybe it’s what’s best.",1
"Ellen DeGeneres is in Rwanda at the future home of Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, where she’s making some new friends (i.e., gorillas). (Photo: Ellen DeGeneres via Instagram)  Ellen DeGeneres is on the trip of a lifetime.  For her 60th birthday, the talk show host’s wife, Portia de Rossi, surprised her with her own gorilla conservation center in Rwanda, which will be called the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, because DeGeneres is both an animal lover and a superfan of the late Fossey. So the couple has traveled to Africa together — you may have noticed that DeGeneres has guest hosts on her show — to see the site of the future campus and hang with gorillas and giraffes along the way.  DeGeneres said she’s been waiting her whole life to make the trek. She’s said that the person she’d most like to interview would be the Gorillas in the Mist author, who died in 1985. She’s also said that as a kid, she read every word of a 1970 National Geographic cover story on Fossey that detailed her research camp in the Virunga Mountains of Rwanda.  I’ve waited my whole life to make this trip. pic.twitter.com/J2GNciu9Oy — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) May 31, 2018      She was thrilled to touch down in the country.      Once there, she got to sit at her hero’s desk, a moving moment for sure.      She was more excited to spend time with the gorillas, watching them play and make gorilla noises.      “I can’t begin to describe what this experience was like, or how much it means to me,” DeGeneres wrote. “I’m so grateful.” (Make sure you play this too because there are more great gorilla noises.)      Her smile kinda says it all.      De Rossi was safari ready with her threads.      One of our favorite photos that De Rossi shared (so far), though, was of DeGeneres taking a “coffee break” during their safari. So casual!      The women hiked with the Fossey Fund CEO, Tara Stoinski, in their gorilla T-shirts.      DeGeneres and De Rossi also met with the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, because this facility is a big deal. It will cost an estimated $10 million to complete; so far, the duo has raised about $8 million, including a mega donation of $4 million that Ashton Kutcher announced would be coming from tech company Ripple.      They talked about gorilla conservation:  Video: President Kagame meets with Ellen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi. pic.twitter.com/x3xepPnvv2 — Presidency | Rwanda (@UrugwiroVillage) May 29, 2018      The couple’s African adventures began in Kenya, where they also got up close and personal with animals — that time, giraffes.      There was some flirting going on.      They stayed at Giraffe Manor in Nairobi.      We’re not sure we’d be able to order either, with all that was going on.      We’re not saying this tops DeGeneres’s infamous Oscars selfie, but it’s close. (What can we say, we love giraffes.)          According to the Gorilla Fund website, DeGeneres’s campus — which will feature 50,000 square feet of building space and a living lab on the grounds — will allow the organization to “expand our science, research, and conservation activities; enhance our educational and community programs; and engage people from Rwanda and the world to join the effort on behalf of wild gorillas.” Depending on fundraising, the goal is to open the facility by 2020.

"Ellen DeGeneres has all the feels!  On Thursday's episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the daytime talk show host continues to celebrate her 60th birthday by having wife Portia de Rossi on the program.  Seated next to Ellen, the 45-year-old actress proceeds to bring her wife of nine years to tears upon presenting her with the ""best"" gift.  ""It's your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about,"" Portia explains. ""Not just now, but what you've always cared about. What you were influenced by and what has made you the amazing person that you are today. So, I combined that and questions when we first met like, 'Who's your idol? And what would you do if you weren't a talk show host?'""  She continues, ""So, I combined that with the fact that literally guys, for, like, the last two years, Ellen has said to me, 'I feel like I'm not doing enough.' Every day, almost. So, I put all that together and I got you this gift. So, let's see it -- happy birthday!""  Portia then cuts to a video of her talking about Ellen's hero, Dian Fossey, and her dedication to animals. ""So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,"" she reveals. ""Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!""  Portia didn't stop there! ""I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,"" she shares. ""So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do.""  Blown over by the gift, Ellen says tearfully, ""It’s the best gift.

"There have been plenty of celebrity breakups recently, but none have been so carefully analyzed as the Pitt-Jolie separation. Each bit of information that reaches the media is being treated like a chess move in a big game of Who Gets to Keep Their Reputation.  Angelina Jolie filed for divorce after an alleged altercation between Brad Pitt and their son Maddox on a private plane. The only info that we, the reading public had at first was that she cited irreconcilable differences, and was trying to get sole custody of their children. Wanting sole custody seemed significant, even before reports of Pitt’s drinking began to surface.  Now that Marion Cotillard has denied any involvement in the separation, the media focus is more and more on how Pitt interacts with his children. Is he a man who drinks and emotionally or physically abuses his family when intoxicated? Or is Angelina Jolie exaggerating one family argument so she can get custody, then jet off to the U.N., as the Pitt camp alleges? It all kind of hinges on some recorded evidence of the inciting incident that supposedly led to Jolie’s filing.  Lainey Gossip devoted a long blog Friday to the way in which Brad Pitt has been trying to set up the video of his argument with Jolie and Maddox, a video that has not yet been released, but likely will judging from the way Pitt’s PR is trying to lay the groundwork. She points out that Pitt’s team has clearly chosen People as their tabloid of choice, and in a post literally titled “Brad’s Side of the Story” they have carefully crafted how we should read the abuse allegations. As Lainey writes:  You know what’s interesting though? PEOPLE’s version of “Brad’s side of the story” has been amended. The one that’s up on the site right now has been edited. Originally when they posted the article last night, this is how it read: The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. “He is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was nose to nose and was spiraling out of control.” You see the difference? The detail about Brad and presumably Maddox going “nose to nose”? Also this sentence has been removed from the paragraph that now ends with “attempts to gain custody”: The Pitt source adds that the star “was not black-out drunk” and that “he absolutely remembers that evening and has been interviewed at length to that effect.” Brad’s team doesn’t want you visualising him going “nose to nose” with his 15 year old son. And they certainly don’t want you suspecting that he may have been “black-out drunk”. Just, you know, regular drunk. But drunk enough that Brad’s people can’t straight up deny it. And drunk enough and angry enough that his people cannot categorically dismiss the reports that there was all kinds of drama on that plane.  Advertisement  It seems like this video will be seen by the public, either through a “leak” or the divorce proceedings, and both sides are prepping public perceptions for how it should be received. As with Amber Heard and Johnny Depp (the latter of whom is represented by the same lawyer as Jolie), how you are seen by the world when you’re a celebrity has a big sway on how you will be treated when you come out on the other side of an ugly divorce.",1
"I like to play characters who are the absolute opposite of me. I think the farther you get from yourself, the more fun you have because the real you is hidden away.

"Eagle-eyed fans may have noticed that Ryan Gosling closed out his gig as host for the season 43 premiere of Saturday Night Live wearing a graphic shirt bearing the image of his dog, George. As it turns out, there was quite a sentimental reason before the sartorial statement. Appearing on Ellen yesterday, Gosling confirmed that the beloved canine had recently passed away at the age of seventeen. ""He was a good friend to me,"" Gosling told Ellen Degeneres during the sit-down. ""There was something about George where he always—I think he felt being a dog was beneath him. He would not do tricks. if you wanted him to sit down you would have to convince him that it was in his best interest.""  Fans of the actor will be familiar with just how close the pair were—George even appeared alongside Gosling during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a few years back. Gosling took Friday's stint on Ellen to share some of his other favorite memories of the canine. ""One time we were at an outdoor restaurant and he was sort of sitting on the pavement, looking forlorn down the street,” he shared. “Someone got up to go to the restroom, and I guess he’d had enough, and he got up on their seat and sat down at the table like a gentleman and looked around the table, like, ‘Yeah, that’s right.’”  In brighter Gosling news, his film Bladerunner 2049 , for which he's been on the promo circuit for over the past few weeks, opened in theaters on Friday after much anticipation to generally favorable reviews. The long overdue sequel is set to pull in $36 million in its opening weekend, and is already generating some early Academy Awards buzz—meaning that we can expect plenty more emotional talk show appearances in the coming months.

"Immigration reform was a major component of President Barack Obama's campaign platform. He promised to secure the border, crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.While watching ABC's This Week as part of our fact-checking partnership with the show, we learned of a promise that we hadn't heard before. During the campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. ""I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,"" Obama said. ""But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.""We checked our database of promises, and found that that while we did have promises from Obama on immigration reform, we missed this one with its specific deadline. So we're adding it, along with a rating.Obama set a timetable for this promise, saying he would ""strongly support"" an immigration bill in his first year. But, well into his second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by Obama has been introduced in Congress.We searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org and found numerous mentions of immigration reform. In April 2009, in response to a question about the one-year deadline, he said that he saw the ""process moving this first year."" In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated ""that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.""Alas, the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Senators Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework ""to fix our broken immigration system."" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the President called a ""a very important step.""Finally, Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. ""In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we""ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,"" said Obama.Obama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But we're well into the second year of Obama's presidency, and all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills. Unless the White House has a time machine that we don't know about, this is a Promise Broken.",0
"Taylor Swifts friendship comes with a few perks for Ed Sheeran (Picture: Getty)  Ed Sheeran’s magnetic sex appeal may not be down to his genes or personality alone, it transpires.  Ed Sheeran hangs out with his best friend Taylor Swift’s ex Tom Hiddleston  The 26-year-old singer has confessed that being best friends with Taylor Swift allowed him to get close to (read: have sex with) lots of beautiful women, particularly when he was supporting her on tour.  Suffolk-born Ed, who counts Selena Gomez and Ellie Goulding among his former conquests, seems beyond grateful to Taylor for this, which might explain the ‘arts and crafts’ Christmas presents he sends to her. WTF.  Ed with Taylor and Selena, one of which he’s been romantically linked to, last year (Picture: Getty)  Ed told Rolling Stone of his wingwoman: ‘Taylor’s world is celebrity. I was this 22-year-old awkward British kid going on tour with the biggest artist in America, who has all these famous mates.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ‘It was very easy [wooing the ladies]. I would often find myself in situations just kind of waking up and looking over and being like, “How the f**k did that happen?”.’  Gushing further about Taylor, Ed added: ‘She would be there if everything ended for me. Taylor is kind of an anomaly in that sense.  ‘She’s omnipresent because she’s the most famous woman in the world, so she can’t make the decision to not be in the press. I always stick up for Taylor.’  Elsewhere in the interview, Ed hinted he and his guardian angel will do a joint tour together and ‘trade songs’ during gigs, as Jay Z and Justin Timberlake did a few years ago.  No one is trying to deny Ed and Taylor are BFFs (Picture: Anna Webber/Getty Images for Atlantic Records)  Taylor, who was also interviewed by the mag for the same issue, backed this up — and claimed she and Ed are still very close, despite their geographical divide.  ‘We’ve gotten matching Scottish folds, made each other arts and crafts Christmas presents, vacationed with our families, and had each other’s backs,’ Swift said.  ‘He is the James Taylor to my Carole King and I can’t imagine a time when he wouldn’t be.’  Ed is now in a serious relationship with Cherry Seaborn, and we expect she won’t want a repeat of the shenanigans on his and Taylor’s last tour together.

"Nearly three months ago, Jimmy Kimmel broke down in tears during a powerful monologue on his late-night show about his newborn son’s recent open heart surgery.  His candor drew much-needed attention to the importance of providing all Americans, especially those with pre-existing conditions like his son, with adequate health care.  On Friday, Kimmel took to Twitter to share the first photo of William “Billy” Kimmel since opening up about his health struggles.  “Billy is 3 months old & doing great. Thx for the love & support. Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got,” Kimmel wrote alongside a photo of his smiling baby boy.  Billy is 3 months old & doing great. Thx for the love & support.

Remind your Congresspeople to protect them,” she wrote.  Billy's looking out for a lot of his buddies at Children's Hospital.

The newborn underwent a successful open-heart surgery at just three days old and returned home six days later.  “Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was,” Kimmel explained at the time, “there was a good chance you’d never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition.”  The speech quickly went viral as the Republican-dominated Senate debated repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a new health care plan that threatens to cut funding for millions, especially for those with pre-existing conditions.  He also revealed that his son will likely needed an additional surgery somewhere between the ages of 3- and 6-months-old.",0
"LONDON — Ariana Grande sent her love to fans on Tuesday as dignitaries, survivors, first responders and the people of Manchester gathered to mark the anniversary of the concert bombing that killed 22 people. The pop star wrote in a tweet to survivors and the families of victims that she was ""thinking of you all today and every day.""  ""I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day,"" she wrote in a tweet that included a bee, the civic symbol of Manchester.  thinking of you all today and every day 🐝 I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) May 22, 2018  Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan descent, blew himself up as fans were leaving Grande's concert at Manchester Arena on May 22, 2017. Twenty-two concertgoers were killed, and police say more than 800 people were left ""with physical and deep psychological injuries."" Grande suspended her Dangerous Woman Tour after the bombing and returned for the One Love Manchester charity concert weeks later, which raised funds for victims of the attack.  Last June, Grande was made an honorary citizen of Manchester after a unanimous vote by the city council. The singer has paid tribute to victims of the attack, including the youngest, Saffie Roussos, who would have turned 9 last July. During Grande's July show in Buenos Aires, the singer reprised her take on ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" which she also performed at One Love. She closed off the song by blowing a kiss and saying, ""Happy birthday, Saffie.""  On Tuesday, across Manchester, residents made defiant statements of unity in the face of extremist violence.  Some laid bouquets of flowers in St. Ann's Square; others left hand-written notes on Japanese maples that have been planted to form a ""Trees of Hope"" trail through the city. One note cited U.S. Episcopal bishop Michael Curry's sermon at Saturday's royal wedding: ""As a clever bishop said 'there is power in love.'""  A girl cries as she looks at at tributes left in St Anne's Square on the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing, in Manchester, England, May 22, 2018. Andrew Yates / REUTERS  Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was a day to ""come together.""  Thousands of people paused outside Manchester Cathedral at 2:30 p.m. for a minute of silence that was observed across the country — including in Parliament, where lawmakers paused their debates and fell still.  Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May joined survivors and emergency workers who responded to the attack for a remembrance service at the cathedral.  A choir sang ""Amazing Grace"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" and Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and humanist leaders all addressed the congregation.  On the altar stood 22 lit candles, made from the wax of thousands of candles left in the city's St. Ann's Square in the days after the attack.  William read a passage from the Bible's book of Corinthians, ending: ""Faith, hope and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.""  Robby Potter, who was hit by shrapnel as he waited to pick his daughter up from the concert, said he felt he had to come to the service ""to support the families who have lost people.""  ""We were very lucky, we know how lucky we are,"" he told Sky News. ""It's a case of standing strong. The country stood strong, especially Manchester.""  Later, thousands of people — including a choir of survivors — are due to gather for a concert and sing-song in St. Ann's Square. The event will include renditions of Grande's ""One Last Time"" and ""Look Back In Anger"" by Oasis, which became an unofficial anthem of Manchester after the bombing.  Bells on the city hall and churches will ring out at 10:31 p.m., exactly a year since the bomb exploded.  Police say 100 investigators are still working on the case. The U.K. has issued an arrest warrant for Abedi's younger brother, Hashem Abedi, and is seeking his extradition from Libya — a far-from-straightforward process given that country's political chaos.",0
"Target to Discontinue Sale of Holy BibleTarget CEO Brian Cornell announced today the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible. The company has come under fire recently from religious groups for its new transgender bathroom policy. The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902.Speaking with CNBC, Cornell cited recent protests from what he calls “religious extremists” as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. “Target will no longer cater to religious extremists,” said Cornell. “If that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it.” Cornell said the big box chain is “sticking to its guns” regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion. “We believe that everyone, every team member, every guest, and every community, deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.”More…~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is the video referenced above:Source: http://ncrenegade.com/editorial/target-to-discontinue-sale-of-holy-bible/We encourage you to Share our Reports, Analyses, Breaking News and Videos.

"Kim Kardashian is trapped in a terrorism nightmare after RadarOnline.com learned cops have linked her stolen gems to the coffers of Islamic jihadists!  In a bombshell world exclusive, a top Interpol source claimed they have connected the diamonds snatched from Kardashian’s Paris hotel suite during a brazen Oct. 3 robbery to shady moneymen with ties to radical Islamic terrorists.  French police have busted 17 suspects allegedly involved in the heist, and authorities have connected that gang to black-market dealers in Antwerp, Belgium.  Most of the world’s diamonds pass through the city, where underground brokers are notorious for mixing “dirty” stolen stones with “clean” gems for resale.  PHOTOS: Kim’s Hellhole EXPOSED! Inside The Paris Apartment Where Kardashian Was Attacked  Antwerp’s illicit marketplace is a hotbed for devious money-laundering schemes — with profits going to fund violent terrorists around the globe, according to the Financial Action Task Force, an elite band of bean counters that tracks terrorist funds.  “There’s reason to believe the jewelry stolen from Kim Kardashian is going directly into the coffers of terror groups,” said a European official involved in tracking terror groups’ funding.  What’s more, David Levine, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley who’s published works on terrorism, confirmed, “Violent groups are funded by black-market gems.”  PHOTOS: Kim On Lockdown! Kardashian’s Inner Circle Swarms NYC Pad  Kardashian’s nightmare unfolded last fall, when robbers forced their way into the private Paris residence where she was staying.  They tied her up, held her at gunpoint and then locked her in a bathroom before making off with $10 million worth of jewelry, including her 20-carat emerald-cut diamond engagement ring.  Mixing 36-year-old Kardashian’s stolen jewels with fair-trade diamonds makes them almost impossible to trace, and it’s unlikely she’ll ever get them back, our sources said.  PHOTOS: Kourtney & Kendall Partied As Kim Was ATTACKED At Gunpoint — Why She Was Alone  To make matters worse, Kardashian has taken a political stand on behalf of her ancestral homeland of Armenia. Now, she must live with the knowledge her stolen swag could be used to harm her people.  “Who knows what horrors Kim’s bling will end up funding,” said the source.  We pay for juicy info!

On Monday, Robert Pattinson was in attendance for the 27th Annual IFP Gotham Awards in New York City where he was nominated for his new film ""Good Time."" But before he headed straight for the prestigious event, the 31-year-old actor lounged around the red carpet and dished about his experiences with an entirely different film: The ""Twilight"" saga.  It had been five years since the final ""Twilight"" film had been released, ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part Two,"" and in an interview with E! News, the actor was reminded of this event and he could only share how ""amazing"" of an experience it was for him to be involved in such a film.  ""It's all fond memories,"" Pattinson remarked about filming the ""Twilight"" movies. ""I mean it's almost more fond the further away you get from it ... it's just such a magical way to spend your 20s.""  ""I mean it's completely crazy. I still haven't really processed it. I mean I always thought that there'd be more of a fallout—a psychological fallout years later,"" the actor adds.  His remarks about the film come just a week after his ex-girlfriend and fellow ""Twilight"" star Kristen Stewart dished about her own experiences filming the franchise.

"The Real Housewives of Atlanta family just welcomed a new member. RHOA rookie Eva Marcille gave birth to a baby boy, Michael Todd Sterling, Jr., on Friday, April 13, she shared on Instagram.  Eva's son was born at 5:59 p.m. on Friday at 7 pounds, 3 ounces and 19-and-a-half inches long, according to a post on Instagram that showed a photo of little Michael's footprints. Eva captioned the photo, ""All praises be to God!""  The baby boy is Eva's first child with her fiancé, Michael Todd Sterling, an attorney and former candidate for mayor of Atlanta, and their child is named after Sterling. She also has a 4-year-old daughter, Marley Rae, from a previous relationship with musician Kevin McCall.  🤱🏽 All praises be to God! A post shared by Eva Marcille (@evamarcille) on Apr 13, 2018 at 5:57pm PDT  It appears that Eva has been in the hospital since Thursday, April 12, according to photos she posted on Instagram.  Still at it😳 Come on Mikey🤰🏽 A post shared by Eva Marcille (@evamarcille) on Apr 13, 2018 at 11:40am PDT  Eva first announced the happy news of her second pregnancy during an interview with PEOPLE in November 2017. It wasn't long after that when Eva shared the news on Christmas that she and Michael Sr. had gotten engaged.  Eva previously opened up to The Daily Dish about her pregnancy in March, exclaiming that she was ""super, duper excited"" to welcome her baby boy. However, she wasn't so sure if she was ready to have the experience of going into labor again. ""My daughter was 31 hours in labor, like full pain, back labor, the whole nine. And for some reason, I kind of forgot about that, and now I'm remembering all of that, so there's just a little bit of anxiety. Not much, just a little bit,"" she said. ""I feel like I'm as ready as I'm gonna be. There's not much I can do. I'm just gonna bite my teeth, grin and bear it, and Dad will be there feeding me ice chips. So hopefully it'll all work out.""  But Eva said that she's really been ""a lot less antsy"" during her second pregnancy. ""The biggest thing that I learned from being pregnant with Marley and now being pregnant with Mikey is [to] stop worrying. I remember being pregnant with Marley, and every single thing I'm like, 'What is she doing in there? Was that an elbow? Was that a knee? Is she kicking? Is she trying to get out?' I didn't know what was what. I was wondering if I was drinking something and if it was too cold for her or too hot. I was thinking way too much,"" she shared. ""Now, I'm like, sit back, I eat whatever I want to. I'm like, 'It's cold, huh? Feels good doesn't it?' I just take it in stride. It's a lot different. I'm a lot less antsy.""  Eva also shared that Michael Sr. was ""super excited"" to experience the birth of his son. But perhaps no one in Eva's family was looking forward to the arrival of little Mikey as much as her daughter, Marley, who has been carrying a crocheted blanket around the house as if it were her little brother. ""Marley is so excited about being a big sister,"" Eva gushed. ""We put together our fun new fancy stroller, and it's up in the house. So Marley puts the blanket in the stroller, and she goes around the house with it. And she's like, 'Mom, we'll be back. I'm taking the baby to the beach.' She goes around through the living room, through the dining room with the stroller. It's the cutest thing ever. She's, like, really ready.""  Eva and Michael Sr. threw a prince-themed baby shower in Atlanta in honor of their son in March. The America's Next Top Model Cycle 3 winner also proved that she looks just as fierce pregnant during a gorgeous maternity shoot, which she shared photos from earlier this month.

"During Kanye West’s 11-month absence from the site, Twitter could hardly have been described as boring. Even without the 40-year-old rapper’s daily musings, the Twitterverse remained as addictive and corrosive as ever, thanks in large part to it having become, under the 45th president, a flashpoint for international diplomacy, partisan combat and ruthless trollery. But this past weekend, seemingly out of nowhere, Yeezy returned to the site where he once admitted to getting “emotional over fonts”, declared The Life of Pablo “the album of the life” and wondered about the providence of a water bottle he discovered while on an airplane.  The rise and rise of Kanye West’s influence on fashion Read more  Having deleted all those old tweets, West started anew on Sunday with a remarkably on-brand, and predictably existentialist, message. “Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness,” he wrote, following it up with photos of forthcoming Yeezy footwear and the word “Saint”, West’s son’s name, in various typefaces.  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends  Following a 24-hour break, he returned again on Tuesday with a string of aphorisms: “As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency,” read one tweet. “Try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas,” he wrote in another, which the MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes called “extremely good advice”. West went on to call distraction “the enemy of vision” and instructed his 7.6 million followers to “make decisions based on love not fear”.  All these tweets made more sense once West, in a Hollywood Reporter interview with his interior designer Axel Vervoordt, revealed plans to release a philosophy book called Break the Simulation.  “I’ve got this new concept that I’ve been diggin’ into,” he said, describing his Barthesian thesis about photography. “I’ve got a concept about photographs, and I’m on the fence about photographs – about human beings being obsessed with photographs – because it takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or transports you into the future.” Time, West added, “is our most valuable resource”.  To his longtime fans, the preoccupation with lofty ideas like time, capitalism and consciousness are just about the least surprising thing about the 21-time Grammy winner’s return to Twitter. He’s always been hip-hop’s pre-eminent and most brazen sage. What may come as a surprise, though, is the fact that West’s latest tweets are the book, as he revealed on Wednesday morning. “Oh by the way this is my book that I’m writing in real time,” West wrote. “No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write.”  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.  Of course, a tweet-stream-of-consciousness book is not the only thing on West’s plate. The rapper-cum-designer is also reportedly working on his eighth studio album, his first since 2016’s The Life of Pablo, which was dropped during an elaborate listening session at New York’s Madison Square Garden. In a since-deleted tweet from 2016, West said his next album would be called “Turbo Grafx 16”, a title that’s presumably gone through a few iterations since, as West changed the name of his seventh album several times before settling on Pablo.  In March, E! News reported that West, along with several of his collaborators, was recording at a studio in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where “he is in the zone to get things done”. Rumored visitors of West’s, gleaned from Instagram posts and sightings in the Jackson area, reportedly included the Dream, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi and the Chicago rapper King Louie.  Nevertheless, exactly when West plans to release new music is unclear. He and his wife, Kim Kardashian, welcomed a third child, Chicago, in January, and he’s also hard at work on the latest collection for his clothing line, Yeezy. But if West’s insightful and reliably zany return to Twitter is any indication, he is not wanting for consciousness-shifting ideas.",0
"Opening up. Big Brother alum Natalie Negrotti revealed that she is pansexual and dating a woman during the Tuesday, July 17, episode of The Challenge: Final Reckoning. She also claimed that Kayleigh Morris outed her on social media following the huge fight during Vendettas, in which other women in the house threw Kaleigh’s luggage over the balcony. While Natalie claims she was not part of the “mean girls” moment, as the show phrased it, Kaleigh didn’t believe her, later calling her a “lesbian” on social media.  “She did it in a really malicious way, and that’s what really hurt me. The way she did it. She was saying, ‘She doesn’t even like d—k, she likes p—sy. She’s a lesbian.’ I’m not a lesbian, I’m pansexual,” Natalie, 28, told Us Weekly on the “Watch With Us” podcast. “She outed me in a really aggressive way and kept going. It was really homophobic in a way. To me, that’s getting gay shamed. Then there was a whole bunch of people that started gay-shaming me, calling me a ‘dyke,’ going on my social media and attacking me for being gay.”  Natalie wasn’t ready to come out – and didn’t plan on doing so on the show. In fact, she hadn’t told her family at the time of Kayleigh’s comments. Since, she has called everyone and was forced to open up about everything.  “It’s been a 28-year battle for me,” Natalie said. “I wanted to set a standard because you can’t do that. There are so many teenagers and kids that commit suicide every year because they get outed inappropriately. She took something that was mine and made it her own, and she did it really in a nasty way. Outing someone is not right and I want to set that standard … I wanted to come out in the right way, I wanted to turn it into something positive so that viewers that are going through the same thing that I’ve gone through don’t have to go through it for 28 years.”  Natalie also revealed she is in an exclusive relationship with a woman, who she describes as her “biggest supporter.” After Vendettas, Natalie and Johnny Bananas dated casually while both seeing other people. Ultimately, it just didn’t work.  The former NFL cheerleader added: “She’s a really great fit for me, and she’s really special to me.”  Listen to the podcast above to hear more about Natalie’s journey, what happened between she and Johnny, how it’s been working with Paul Calafiore and more.

"Selena Gomez checked into a treatment center, and RadarOnline.com has the exclusive details about her latest rehab stint.  Justin Bieber’s 25-year-old girlfriend spent the last two weeks of January in a New York area treatment center and a source explained that those close to her were afraid of a drug relapse.  “Selena’s inner circle is afraid she is back on drugs and racing toward a breakdown,” the insider told Radar.  PHOTOS: Selena Gomez & Ex Justin Bieber’s ‘Tense’ Reunion Two Years After Split  The singer’s party lifestyle was enabled by her boyfriend, the informant claimed.  “The label just gave her another huge advance which, mixed with Justin’s resources — he’s covering her security and transportation — has led to some pretty heavy partying…even for her.”  Gomez cut off her mother, Mandy Teefey, in the middle of her latest breakdown.  PHOTOS: Selena Gomez & Justin Bieber Caught On Sweet Church Date After Intimate Reunion  “Selena changed her number again in an effort to avoid Mandy. Mandy is now speaking to Selena through Justin and his mother,” the insider snitched to Radar.  Another source revealed Gomez sought treatment for “depression and anxiety.”  “Selena doesn’t want to fall back into her old ways,” the insider said. “She wants to be proactive about staying healthy.”  PHOTOS: Selena Gomez & Justin Bieber’s Nasty Jabs At Her Ex The Weeknd  As Radar previously reported, Gomez checked into rehab in 2016 to battle her demons.  An insider revealed that Gomez had begun using a potentially deadly cocktail of “Lunesta, Ambien, Klonopin and Xanax” before loved ones staged a desperate intervention and checked her into rehab.  “Everyone close to her is worried because she seems to be back to old behavior,” said the source of Gomez, who also did a previous stint in treatment back in 2014.

"Multiple tabloids have been reporting that there is something going on between Robert Pattinson and Emma Watson, leading fans to believe that there could be some merit to the story. Then, after the pair presented together at the Golden Globe Awards, reports surfaced that the two went public with their relationship. But, fans will be disappointed to find out that there is no truth to the story, and the claims that Pattinson and Watson are dating are completely false.  The problem is, celebrities don’t choose who they present with at an awards show. So, the fact that Pattinson and Watson shared a few minutes on stage together in no way means the two are in a relationship. The pair presented the award for Best TV Movie or Limited Series, which went to HBO’s Big Little Lies.  Now, there is a new twist to the rumor, with another publication telling a tall tale about Pattinson propositioning Watson for a one-night stand.  #RobertPattinson opens up: ""This Halloween I walked into the most extreme, ah, fancy dress party. I was absolutely normcore and it was the most humiliating experience of my life."" https://t.co/KWcnK4pU3w — W magazine (@wmag) January 19, 2018  The false story, which appeared in Star magazine, alleged that Pattinson has had a crush on Watson since they starred together in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire back in 2005. It then went on to claim that Pattinson used a terrible pick-up line by asking her, “Do you want to hang out at my house, you know, like overnight?”  The so-called eyewitness then says that, since Watson isn’t a one-night stand type of girl, she made a face like she had eaten some rotten food and ran away.  But, the incident simply never happened. Reps for both Watson and Pattinson say that the two actors had fun at the awards ceremony, but he didn’t hit on her and she didn’t reject him.  Today at the @womensmarch LA I was carrying this sign and all of a sudden I look over and see EMMA WATSON staring at me from 3ft away. She waved, motioned that she loved my sign, and then I cried. I will NEVER be this cool again guys ✨? pic.twitter.com/RAzM6WZVr8 — Molly Pasquarella (@Molly_Pasqui) January 21, 2018  Once Watson split from her boyfriend, entrepreneur William “Mack” Knight, back in November, meaning both she and Pattinson were single, tabloids started to randomly tie the two together just three weeks later. Once one outlet fabricated the romantic connection, others picked it up and copied the story. But, it is all complete fiction.  Watson and Pattinson have not been secretly texting or meeting up in London and Los Angeles. They are simply friends and nothing more.  Advertisement  This isn’t the first time that rumors have spread about the former co-stars. Back in 2009, the same story flew around Hollywood, but Emma Watson shut it down by saying that Robert Pattinson is just a good friend and a super-nice guy, adding he is great to work with.",0
"Amid ""reports"" Miley Cyrus and Liam have broken up, another rumor has surfaced about the couple.  While the split rumors were making their way around the internet, Miley and Liam were actually spotted together in Nashville recently.  The sighting prompted some fans to believe they saw the slightest hint of a baby bump as Miley walked by at the airport.  . on Twitter VIDEO | Miley & Liam were spotted at the airport in Nashville. July 18th, 2018. https://t.co/w3cAAfAtey  What do you think? We watched the video, and for a split second it looked like she did have a baby bump.  Perhaps though, it could just be the angle or her wardrobe deceiving us.  Now, The Mirror just published an article saying that according to sources close to Miley, she has stopped dying her hair, drinking, and smoking.  Could that be an indication she is indeed pregnant?  Well maybe, or maybe she's just trying to live a healthy lifestyle.  The publication also reached out to Cyrus's rep for comment. As of this posting, they have yet to respond.  It should be interesting to see how this one plays out.  QCWriter is a journalist who is fueled by espresso and motivated by determination.

"Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia  Miley Cyrus had no filter when it came to gushing about everything from her new music to her relationship with Liam Hemsworth in Billboard's new cover story, but there was one passage that had readers stopping short and lingering on her comments on hip-hop, specifically, for her brief characterization of it as materialistic and misogynistic.  The comment came about when she name-checked Kendrick Lamar's ""Humble"" as an inspirational track, and Cyrus specified why she loved the DAMN. single — or what she doesn't love about other rap, really. ""I love [""Humble""] because it’s not 'Come sit on my dick, suck on my cock,'"" she told Billboard. ""I can’t listen to that anymore. That’s what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much 'Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock' — I am so not that.""  Once swift, angry blowback followed the publication of the piece, Cyrus took to Instagram to share her side of the story, or her account of what didn't make it into print: She stressed that the comment was made in a broader conversation and that she's an ""artist without borders"" who was asked about her thoughts on rap for this particular conversation.  ""A lot of the time publications like to focus on the most sensationalized part of the conversation,"" she writes. ""So, to be clear I respect ALL artists who speak their truth and appreciate ALL genres of music (country, pop, alternative .... but in this particular interview I was asked about rap) I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop as I've collaborated with some of the very best! At this point in my life I am expanding personally/musically and gravitating more towards uplifting, conscious rap!""  She closes by reminding her followers that she's got new music coming — her single, ""Malibu,"" from her forthcoming album is set to drop on May 11 — and that she hopes that her words ""encourage others to LOVE."" Her note is way closer to her mission than the comments she made in passing, that's for sure, so we'll wait and see if any ""uplifting, conscious rap"" makes it way onto the record.",0
"Married at First Sight‘s Cody Knapek and Danielle DeGroot are calling it quits on their marriage.  “After a year of marriage, and much thought and consideration, we are deeply saddened to announce that we’ve decided to go our separate ways,” the reality stars — who met for the first time on their wedding day — tell PEOPLE exclusively in a statement. “We remain the closest of friends, and have enjoyed sharing our lives with our Married at First Sight family.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “We want to thank the experts for their guidance and love throughout all of this. This process has only strengthened our belief that true love does exist!” continues the statement.  Larry Remiker  The couple wed last August and often battled on the show over DeGroot’s hesitation to consummate their marriage. Though they chose to stay married on the season finale of Lifetime’s hit show (produced by Kinetic Content), DeGroot revealed on the show’s reunion episode that she still hadn’t fallen for her husband.  “I still just don’t feel in love, I think, so it’s very hard for me to totally embrace it,” said the dietitian about their lack of intimacy even after cameras stopped rolling.  On Tuesday, DeGroot opened up to fans on her Instagram page about their split. “It hasn’t been an easy year, but it has been one of a lot of personal growth and of meeting some amazing people, including the one I got to marry,” she wrote in a caption. “We value and respect marriage, but life is short and we also value happiness.”  “While this was a difficult decision and divorce is not something either of us hoped for, we decided we will be happiest separating. Still got nothin’ but love for you @codyknapek,” she continued.  The two other couples from the pair’s season — Anthony D’Amico and Ashley Petta, and Sheila Downs and Nate Duhon — are still going strong.  While none of the couples from the second and third season of the show worked out, fan favorites Courtney Hendrix-Carrion and Jason Carrion from the show’s inaugural season are still happily wed.  And most notably, Jamie Otis and her husband Doug Hehner, who also met and fell in love on the show’s first season, welcomed their first child together Tuesday morning.",0
"It's no secret that Houston Texan J.J. Watt has always had a crush on Jennifer Aniston. All you have to do is look at his Twitter feed: ""Anybody who knows me knows my one lifetime crush has been Jennifer Aniston"" reads a tweet from February 12, 2014.  Now it looks like dreams do come true — even for NFL superstars. On Monday night, Watt met his lifetime crush, and he couldn't help exulting about it. He tweeted the photo above, with the caption, ""I'm not even going to try to pretend like I acted cool when this happened. #LifeMade""  We're guessing the duo met in Los Angeles, where Watt will appear on the ESPY Awards Wednesday night. The two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year is up for Best Male Athlete alongside Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors), LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) and Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers). He's also a nominee for Best NFL Player along with Tom Brady (New England Patriots), Antonio Brown (Pittsburgh Steelers), DeMarco Murray (Philadelphia Eagles) and Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers).  But even if he doesn't take home the sports award, he's had quite an offseason, cavorting with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki in Paris, pretending to be a security guard for the Zac Brown Band, doing a dead-on impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger and flying in a private plane — which still excites Watt, even though he's a multimillionaire.",0
"This Is Us kicked off its second season last year with a bit of a stumble, courtesy of NBC: the network announced at its 2017 upfront that the show would move to Thursdays, only to backtrack two weeks later. But then the drama went on to do something that few recent breakout freshman series have accomplished: it became an even bigger hit in Season 2, where it was the highest-rated entertainment broadcast series in the adults 18-49 demographic last season, with a 5.4 rating.  After avoiding the dreaded sophomore slump, This Is Us returns tonight for Season 3, and NBC—which won’t have the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics or Thursday Night Football to help inflate it this season—will be counting on the show to help keep it on top in the 18-49 demo for what would be the third straight season.  Robert Greenblatt, in an interview before he announced yesterday that he was stepping down as NBC Entertainment chairman after seven years, said that This Is Us shows the power of broadcast TV, which is “the only place where you can gather a huge group of people together for a shared experience,” he said. “When 12 to 14 million people watch America’s Got Talent in the summer, or more than that watch This Is Us in the fall or spring, that’s an extraordinary cultural achievement.”  While Greenblatt scuttled the show’s Thursday move last year after realizing the extent to which Thursday Night Football would disrupt the show’s narrative arc, he didn’t consider relocating the show to Thursday this season, after the network lost Thursday Night Football to Fox.  “We felt, by this point, that it’s a Tuesday staple, for I’m happy to say a large part of the country. We also got some nice traction on Thursday with Will & Grace, and The Good Place is really coming into its own,” said Greenblatt. “So we thought, rather than jumble the cards again, let’s keep a good thing going on Tuesday and let’s build more of a good thing on Thursday. We’re really excited about putting [Law & Order:] SVU on Thursday at 10, which is a great thing for that night also. There’s a lot to be said for stability on your schedule.”  As for how the show was able to avoid stumbling in Season 2, “we have extraordinary writers and [creator] Dan Fogelman is just the greatest sort of visionary,” said Greenblatt. “I haven’t seen a creator who’s as far advanced in plotting a series than he is. He’s weaving in elements from seasons four, five and six, which haven’t even been completely conceived yet. But he knows where all these stories are going.”  Fogelman “knew from the beginning of the first season what the second season was meant to be: the year of what happened to [Milo Ventimiglia’s character] Jack, and his death. We had the Super Bowl [last season] and we knew early on we were going to make that the ultimate episode in the middle of the season,” said Greenblatt. “So there were a couple of things that came together that made Season 2 as anticipated as that first season was.”  NBC thinks the show’s momentum will continue this season. “I feel very bullish about Season 3 for a lot of reasons, which will remain sort of mysterious because I don’t want to give anything away,” said Greenblatt. “But there’s some extraordinary things he’s going to do this year.”",0
"Caitlyn Jenner is “very proud” of Kim Kardashian West for her conversations with President Donald Trump that led to the pardon of Alice Marie Johnson, the 62-year-old great-grandmother who was incarcerated for 22 years over a first-time nonviolent drug offense.  In a sit-down interview with Variety published on Tuesday, Jenner spoke out about her former step-daughter’s foray into politics, which began with a phone call from Trump and culminated in a meeting between the two at the White House in May.  “I thought they did the right thing,” Jenner, 68, told the trade magazine of the mother of three, whom she has not spoken to in years. “I was very proud of her.”  Jenner herself is “very politically involved” and has been busy working to shape policy in the Trump administration, though more so behind the scenes.  “I don’t do a lot of media. I don’t want to be seen everywhere,” she said. “Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don’t stick my nose into everything publicly.”  Caitlyn Jenner and Donald Trump Jon Kopaloff/WireImage; Evan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock  RELATED: Where Caitlyn Jenner Stands with Every Woman in the Kardashian Family  A long outspoken Republican, Jenner voted for Trump in the 2016 election on what she thought was a promise of continued progress for LGBTQ rights.  “On the economics side, I’m very conservative. I believe in limited government, I believe in lower taxes, I believe in less regulations, I want a thriving economy, I want Americans to be able to succeed,” Jenner said. “But socially, I’m much more progressive. We have to get them to be more progressive with social issues. It’s their biggest problem.”  But since Trump’s election, there’s been an attempt to roll back rights — including Trump’s failed attempt to stop transgender people from enrolling in the military and his move to lift federal protections for transgender students that would guarantee their freedom to use public school bathrooms and locker rooms matching their chosen gender identity.  “I honestly don’t know what happened when he got in there,” Jenner remarked. “It was extraordinarily disappointing.”  Well @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me. pic.twitter.com/XwYe0LNUOq — Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) February 24, 2017  Though she hasn’t spoken to Trump since his election (despite publicly asking the president to call her), Jenner explained that she regularly makes trips to Washington, D.C. and has had long meetings with roughly 50 members of the House and Senate and many members of Trump’s White House directly.  “I met with Paul Ryan. I’ve met with just about everybody. Publicly, they aren’t supportive of transgender rights. … I’ve never had anybody not be nice to my face,” she said, telling Variety that the conversations were confidential but often included “invasive questions about her body and genitalia.”  “I think it’s a good thing that I’m on the Republican side because I’ve got an in,” she said. “Has this administration set us backwards? Absolutely. And every time they’ve done it, I’ve fought it. …. I fight those types of wars. I fight the equality wars. I do it all very quietly. We’re going to be okay in the end.”  She added: “What’s going on in Washington D.C. is just disgraceful. The hate, the media, all the things that are going on there. … [Trump’s] not been doing a very good job, but it’s not over yet.”  RELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Writer Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack  Because Jenner’s advocacy for transgender rights on Capitol Hill has been mostly behind the scenes, many members of the LGBTQ community have felt frustrated that she hasn’t been using her celebrity and influence to help.  That criticism has caused Jenner to feel isolation from her own community. “I’ve felt it big time, and it hurts,” she said. “Sometimes this community can be really tough.”  “No matter what you say or do, they think you don’t get it because you’re this kind of white, privileged person,” Jenner confessed, disputing any notion that she isn’t an advocate. “I haven’t turned my back on anybody. … We need hard-core legislation, laws on the book of equality. It’s going to take some time, but we’re working on it.”",1

I’m more than sorry for the mistakes I have made,” Miller began in a lengthy post on Sunday, January 21, via Instagram. “My world flipped upside down when I had to enter prison.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be staying in town after their May 19 wedding.  The pair will not jet off for their romantic honeymoon right after saying ""I do,"" Kensington Palace confirmed in a press briefing on Friday.  “The couple will be going on honeymoon, but not straightaway,” Kensington Palace spokesman Jason Knauf said. “They will have their first engagement as a married couple in the week after the wedding.”  Meghan Markle Spotted Getting in Shape for Her Royal Wedding  When they do get a chance to get away, Meghan and Harry are expected to honeymoon in Namibia -- a place where they'll find plenty of privacy, as it's one of the least densely populated countries in the world. Travel + Leisure magazine reported last month that the twosome will stay at Namibia's newest luxury camp, Natural Selection's Hoanib Valley Camp.  Harry and Meghan have spent time together in Africa before. In the couple's first joint interview with BBC News after announcing their engagement last November, Harry revealed he and Meghan went camping together in Botswana early in their courtship, solidifying their relationship.  Why Meghan Markle Won't Have a Maid of Honor for Her Royal Wedding With Prince Harry  ""We met once and then twice, back-to-back, two dates in London, last July,"" Harry said. ""I think about three, maybe four weeks later, I managed to persuade her to come join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars. We spent five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other.""

"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie Are Today’s New Anchor Team  As for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast — and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.  “I’m having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,” she says. “I’ve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten. And now we’re ‘dropping’ episodes weekly. Coming up: Laverne Cox and Amy Schumer.  “Meanwhile, I’m still happily married (after three years!) and I’m teaching John how to do Instagram stories,” she continues. “His are pretty lame so far. I’m also getting ready for my younger daughter Carrie’s college graduation. (GULP!) And there are some other cool projects I’ll be able to announce soon. I’m addicted to work!",0

"When it comes to fashion, no one competes with Rihanna. Heading to Indio, California to take in Coachella this weekend, she left the flower crowns and body paint at home, showing up in looks direct from the catwalk. While the star has always had fun pushing the limits of festival dressing—who can forget last year’s epic Gucci bodysuit or the Matthew Adams Dolan deconstructed denim?—this go round proved her most daring. Pulling out transparent Y/Project, custom Chrome Hearts, and a face-covering balaclava that rendered her almost incognito, she took style risks few others would attempt—exactly what she and Fenty creative director Jahleel Weaver were going for. “Coachella should always be fun and disruptive,” shared Weaver via email. “We had such a moment last year with the Gucci crystal bodysuit and mask, so how do we top that?”  when u finna run outta hangers. A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Apr 16, 2018 at 9:06am PDT  Upping the ante meant entering the planning stage early. Though they started to officially brainstorm a month in advance, when Weaver and Rihanna saw a great piece during February’s fashion month, they made a mental note. Case in point: the moment the balaclava turned up at Alessandro Michele’s autumn/winter 2018 Gucci show, it was destined to be worn. “Ri and I both instantly loved it when it came down the runway,” says Weaver. “So we started to think of what’s the next opportunity to wear this? The Gucci team is so great to us and such a pleasure to work with and they made it happen.” The love at first sight rule also applied to the gauzy Y/Project creation, which came with extreme UGGs that made it an outside the box choice: “It was just so NOT Coachella that it made us love the idea even more.”  Advertisement  extra af. #chella18 A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Apr 15, 2018 at 11:38am PDT  Making these unique pieces work requires styling magic and foresight, and Weaver gives credit where it’s due. “I have an amazing assistant Amir that really helps me stay organised and calm which allows me to just focus on all these crazy ideas,” he says. Though he’s mum on when we’ll see the next jaw-dropping Rihanna outfit, their partnership ensures plenty of great fashion on the horizon. “What I love about Ri is that she’s such a non-conformist, which pushes your boundaries of creativity,” says Weaver. “Nothing is off limits.”  This article was originally published on Vogue.com.",0
"Tab Hunter, the '50s heartthrob who starred in ""Damn Yankees"" and ""Battle Cry,"" came out as gay in his 2005 memoir. (Photo: Simon & Schuster)  Tab Hunter, the All-American movie star who made teen hearts race in the 1950s with his blond good looks and blue eyes, has died at 86, his longtime partner Allan Glaser confirmed to USA TODAY.  Glaser said Hunter collapsed in front of their home in Santa Barbara, Calif., and went into cardiac arrest after a blood clot migrated from his leg to his heart. He added that medical personnel spent six hours trying to revive him, without success.  He would have turned 87 on Wednesday.  In addition to his hit movies, his recording of “Young Love” topped the Billboard pop chart in 1957.  But in his 2005 memoir, “Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star,” Hunter recounted the stresses of being a love object to millions of young women when he was, in reality, a gay man.  “I believed, wholeheartedly – still do – that a person’s happiness depends on being true to themselves,” he wrote. “The dilemma, of course, that was being true to myself – and I’m talking sexually now – was impossible in 1953.”  Born Arthur Andrew Kelm, his screen tab (slang for “name” at the time) was fabricated by Henry Willson, the same talent agent who came up with the names Rock Hudson and Rory Calhoun.  The legend goes that Willson said to the young man: “We’ve got to find something to tab you with. Do you have any hobbies?” His client answered, “I ride horses. Hunters.” Agent: “That’s it! We’ll call you Tab Hunter.”  With no dramatic training, Hunter was cast in a minor role in the 1950 drama, “The Lawless.” The fuss over the young actor began two years later when he appeared bare-chested opposite Linda Darnell in the British-made “Island of Desire.” Soon his handsome face and muscular build appeared on magazine covers. Warner Bros., alert to the increasingly important youth market, signed him to a contract.  Hunter made a flurry of movies in the latter half of the 1950s, aimed at capitalizing on his popularity with young girls. The films included such war dramas as “Battle Cry” (with Van Heflin) and “Lafayette Escadrille” (Clint Eastwood in a small role). He made the Westerns “The Burning Hills” (Natalie Wood) and “They Came to Cordura” (Gary Cooper, Rita Hayworth). And he made romantic comedies like “The Pleasure of His Company” (Fred Astaire, Debbie Reynolds.)  A highlight was the 1958 “Damn Yankees!,” an adaptation of the hit Broadway musical with Gwen Verdon and Ray Walston in their Tony-winning New York roles and the original director, George Abbott, sharing direction with Stanley Donen.  Besides the movies, he displayed his athletic skills – he had been a figure skater as well as horseman – in a TV special, “Hans Brinker, or the Silver Skates.”  As with so many pop idols, his fans grew up and a new generation sought other favorites. His slide followed the classic pattern: to a television series (“The Tab Hunter Show,” on NBC, 1960-62); European films (“The Golden Arrow”) and cheap kid flicks (“Ride the Wild Surf.”) In his memoir, he took pains to note that “Ride the Wild Surf” was his only beach-party movie; his “Operation Bikini,” despite its title, was “yet another war movie.”  Over the years, he also played small roles in “The Loved One,” “The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean” and “Grease 2.”  In the 1980s, he won new fans by appearing in cult movies with Divine, the 300-pound transvestite, notably John Waters’ 1981 “Polyester” and Paul Bartel’s 1985 “Lust in the Dust,” co-produced by Hunter himself.  Of “Polyester,” Hunter wrote: “Everybody got the joke. … For both John and me, our collaboration paid huge dividends: I’d helped ‘legitimize’ his brand of movie, and he made me ‘hip’ overnight.”  Hunter appeared on Broadway in 1964 in Tennessee Williams’ “The Milk Train Doesn’t Stop Here Anymore” opposite the formidable Tallulah Bankhead. The play closed within days, and he said it was “completely buried under Tallulah’s offhanded trademark campiness.”  Hunter was born in 1931 in New York City, the second son of a mechanic and his German immigrant wife. His father left the family two years later and the boy took his mother’s name, Gelien. Young Arthur Gelien grew up in San Francisco and Long Beach, California, and joined the Coast Guard at 15, lying about his age.  While in New York, he saw Broadway plays and became interested in acting. Back in California, Willson arranged for a two-word role in a small Western, “The Lawless.” He got $500 and a new name.  In his memoir, he said that his career flourished despite some innuendo and smear articles in the scandal sheets – “clear evidence that despite its self-righteous claims, ‘Confidential’ magazine did not influence the taste and opinions of mainstream America.”  Writing the book was difficult, he told The Associated Press in 2005, “because I’m a really private person. I grew up full of denial. I just didn’t like any suggestions or questioning of my sexuality.”  In 1960, Hunter’s boy-next-door reputation did take a hit when he was charged with cruelty for allegedly beating his dog. (He was acquitted). In recent years, Hunter appeared in dinner theaters and organized film projects. After living on a ranch in New Mexico for a time, he took a home in Montecito with his Glaser.  He didn’t dwell on his Hollywood career or regret losing it. “I had my fling, and I was very fortunate,” he remarked. “But that’s all in my past.”  George Takei, another actor-turned-gay activist, honored him on Twitter Monday, writing, ""Tab Hunter was so much more than a teen heartthrob—he was a celebrated actor, trailblazer, and an icon for the LGBTQ community. Brad and I extend our deepest condolences to his husband, Allan Glaser. RIP, Tab. You will be sorely missed.""  Zachary Quinto, who came out in 2011, noted on Instagram how he had gotten to know Hunter over the last year. ""What a life! Such a rich experience. such a vital and generous nature. and such a pioneer of self-acceptance and moving through this world with authenticity as his guide. he will be missed greatly. may he rest in peace.""  Harvey Fierstein, who won Tonys for acting in ""Torch Song Trilogy"" and writing ""La Cage aux Folles"" and ""Kinky Boots,"" called Hunter a ""gawjuss gay icon.""  Sad to report that Tab Hunter, the gawjuss gay icon, and true gentleman, has left the building. We shared some good laughs back in the 80’s.

"Max PixelConspiracy theorists have sparked fears over an apocalyptic collision between Jupiter and Venus, set to plunge Earth into 15 days of darkness this month.Just when you thought it couldn’t get darker or colder outside, the fear-mongering conspiracy theorists are here to tell you you’re wrong…If you can suspend reality long enough to believe Jupiter and Venus will collide on Monday in an ‘astronomical’ space collision and subsequent global blackout, just because they said so in their falsified NASA statement.ESOAccording to the identity stealing so-called experts, writing on the website Dinos Mark as well as Reflection of Mind, the two brightest planets in our solar system will crash into each other and could even be visible from the naked eye.The far-fetched claim continued:According to the [NASA] report, Venus and Jupiter will engaged in a close parallelism, only being separated by one degree.NASANow, to fan the flames of this fabricated fire, some clever cloggs has even gone as far as to publish a false statement.The statement purported to be written by NASA official Charles Boden – who must be pretty angry right now – ‘confirmed’ the world would be plunged into darkness from November 15 and November 29.NASAThe statement read:NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 15 days of total darkness between November 15 and November 29, 2017. The event, according to NASA, hasn’t occurred in over 1 Million years. Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday, November 15, 2017 at 3am, and will end on Monday, November 30, 2017 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials, the ‘November Black Out’ event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter.Please enable Javascript to watch this videoThe internet hoax isn't news, with many liars claiming darkness will descend in some New World Order extra-terrestrial scam.NASA has denied it will happen time and time again, stating in over one million years, an event like this has never occurred.The overactive imaginations of conspiracy theorists must be commended, but perhaps next time, put it into a work of science fiction rather than try and pass it off as a NASA-confirmed fact.Craig Hamilton-Parker / YoutubeMeanwhile, on the Internet, other theorists are gearing up for their psychic predictions for 2018, like Craig Hamilton-Parker, the self-proclaimed modern day Nostradamus.A self-proclaimed prophet, who wants to seemingly shatter your dreams, hopes and aspirations for next year with his special potion of unproven alarm and fear-mongering mysticism.Hamilton-Parker, who shares all his best work on YouTube and psychics.com from his home in Southampton, foresees a US attack on North Korea, a chemical attack on a European city and an attempt to impeach Trump.GettyHe doesn't reveal his sources, but it seems he’s really keeping up with current affairs in his mission to pull predictions out of his backside.For 2018 he's bookmarked in his calendar the following world crises: US forces striking North Korea by blowing up a key trade route, Kim Jong-un being overthrown by his own people, a failed attempt to impeach Donald Trump and the sinking of a US warship.GettyThe good news is there’s absolutely no proof this guy has any more insight into what’s going to happen to the global political and social climate in 2018, than he does into what I’m going to have for my dinner.Considering my fridge is empty, my stomach’s growling and I make erratic supermarket decisions when I’m hungry, I’d like to see him try.",0

"He is a prince raised in London, the son of the first heir to the British throne.  She is an actress born in California, the daughter of a yoga instructor and a former television lighting director.  But despite their different upbringings, Prince Harry and his American girlfriend Meghan Markle have more in common than we previously believed.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A genealogical investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found that the famous pair are actually distant cousins, related through a late 15th Century ancestor of the Queen Mother.  Getty Images  The publication reports the Suits star's connection to the Royal Family comes as a result of her family's ancestry dating all the bay back to High Sheriff of County Durham Ralph Bowes - an ancestor of Markle from 15 generations ago.  Bowes' family seat was Streatlam Castle situated in the North East of England and his grandson Christopher Hussey moved to America in 1632, helping to found Nantucket, Massachusetts. Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.  Meanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.  What's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's ancestor, Henry VIII, reportedly executed a relative of Markle.  A new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch. As a result, Henry VIII had him beheaded.

A genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.  Who would've though it, ey?

"Fans of The Walking Dead had to say farewell to yet another of their favorite characters Sunday night. In a year in which we’ve lost Carl (Chandler Riggs), Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and possibly Maggie (Lauren Cohan), Jesus (Tom Payne) breathed his last. In typical heroic fashion, he died trying to get others to safety.  While on a mission to rescue Eugene (Josh McDermott) with Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Aaron (Ross Marquand), the group found themselves in a graveyard with a new foe approaching. After fighting off a few walkers with ninja-like skill, Jesus took one last swing of the sword only to have the would-be walker duck, then stab him in the back. Other than Eugene and Rosita, this was the group’s first encounter with the Whisperers, living humans hiding among the dead.  Fans did not take Jesus’s death lightly.  Though many mourn, Payne was ready for his stint on the show to end. He said in a recent interview that he had become frustrated and bored with the character’s storyline.

"Joe Alwyn is finally letting fans in on his daily life — but don’t expect any cuddly selfies with girlfriend Taylor Swift just yet.  Alwyn made his Instagram public over the weekend, simultaneously revealing a past, sly reference to Swift.  On May 8, Swift, 28, posted a picture of herself in front of a huge cactus. Swift — who wore a long black dress and shades for the occasion — wrote, “Fact: I’ve never been more excited about a tour than I am about this one. And it starts TOMORROW. Also, not even remotely tour related, but today I met a cactus.”  As it turns out, Alwyn, 27, posted a picture of the same cactus on the same day, captioning his snapshot with only the corresponding emoji. In his picture, he also stood solo, wearing a grey shirt, black shorts, a cap, and sandals.  Swift kicked off her Reputation tour in Glendale, Arizona, the next day. During the show, the singer seemingly pointed at Alwyn, who was seen in the crowd, as she belted out “Gorgeous.”  WATCH: Taylor Swift’s Friends Think Joe Alwyn Could Be “The One”  RELATED: Ultimate Cat Lady Taylor Swift Pokes Fun at Her Beloved Felines on International Cat Day  Alwyn has since posted a picture from the set of his upcoming film The Favourite with Nicholas Hoult, Emma Stone, and others. Swift liked the photo.  Swift and Alwyn, who dated for months before news of their relationship broke in May 2017, have been spotted spending quality time together as of late.  In July, the couple jetted off to Turks and Caicos, where they splashed and snorkeled in the ocean and held hands on the beach.

"Katie Holmes is not pregnant with Jamie Foxx’s baby, nor are the two planning a wedding together, despite a completely made-up tabloid report. Gossip Cop has repeatedly debunked rumors of the two getting married and starting a family, and we can do so yet again.  According to OK!, those close to the actor and actress believe she’s expecting his child, which will lead to the two walking down the aisle. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “Katie is very traditional and has old-fashioned values. She’s made it clear to Jamie that there’s no way she would have a baby out of wedlock. He’ll be expected to step up to the plate.”  The outlet’s seemingly bogus insider adds, “With their romance finally out in the open they can start planning a future and stop all the tiptoeing around. Katie sees Jamie as perfect daddy material, and husband material too.” But as Gossip Cop has repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes only casually date.

"Kylie Jenner loves a giant holiday centerpiece — and this year, her approach is solid gold.  The cosmetics maven, 21, showed off her glittering metallic Christmas tree standing tall in the entryway of her home on Instagram. The towering conifer features gold branches, a variety of gold ball ornaments, countless glowing lights and even a gold-wrapped stand.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  RELATED: Merry and Bright! See How Celebrities Are Decking Their Halls for the Holidays  “Gold is the theme this year,” she captions a video of the tree, with Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” serving as the soundtrack.  “Thank you @jeffleatham and team for never failing to make Christmas magic happen,” she adds, calling out the celebrity floral designer and artistic director. Leatham, who split from ex husband Colton Haynes in May, is notably also responsible for the over-the-top holiday decor at Kylie’s mom Kris’s mansion and the glam seasonal installations at Four Seasons hotels around the world.  This year’s sparkly model at Kylie’s Hidden Hills home replaces last year’s slightly more realistic one, which she called “20 feet of magic” (the gold version appears to be the same size) and featured a faux-snow covering known as flocking.  The treatment turns up on another of Kylie’s forest of trees for 2018: “I have a neon pink flocked in my bedroom. I literally have trees everywhere this year,” she says in a video documenting a particularly girly one on her Instagram Stories.  This Christmas will no doubt be extra special for Kylie and boyfriend Travis Scott as they celebrate with their 10-month-old daughter Stormi for the first time. In one video documenting the sparkly tree, the new mom zooms in on a gold ball ornament to capture a selfie in the reflection, with Stormi balanced on her hip.  RELATED: Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Buy $13.5 Million L.A. Mansion (and Split the Cost!): Source  Kylie has always gone big on holiday decor. Last year’s ceiling-scraping flocked tree — also by Leatham — was ornamented with massive balls in shades of pink. In 2016, she documented the elaborate process of getting her enormous real tree into her home. It involved a flatbed truck and took several lumberjack-like wranglers to install. That year, she also displayed a massive gingerbread house customized with her name, as well as those of her then-boyfriend, Tyga and his son, King. Her beloved dogs, Bambi, Norman, Ernesto and Penny, were even immortalized in icing.",0
"Coachella is here and the festival may have brought along with the flower crowns and the good music some romance as well.  Some of Hollywood’s greatest names took Coachella by storm and on the first day of the event, some of them sparked dating rumors as well.  Chris Pine and Star Trek Beyond co-star Sofia Boutella were spotted heading to the NYLON Midnight Garden Party alongside Troian Bellisario and Patrick J. Adams.  According to an insider, Chris and Sofia had a great time in each other’s company and were together the whole night. The two reportedly arrived sometime around midnight and stayed at the party for about an hour and a half.  “They were super cute. Chris kept stepping back to let her have the spotlight and wouldn’t take photos but kept watching her when she would pose,” the eyewitness stated. “They were together the entire time and kept walking with his hand around her waist.”  Aww… Can we smell love in the air?  Furthermore, it looks like their buddies also encouraged them to interact and were there to make sure everybody was having fun.  “Troian was so cute. She kept pushing Sofia to do photos and checking in on her,” the insider shared. “You can tell they were all really good friends and having a great double date.”  We should mention first before the speculations go out of control, that Chris and Sofia have been great friends for a while but indeed, their relationship has always had the potential for more.  Sofia took to Instagram to gush over Chris’ acting skills and promoted his movie, saying that he is a “special human” and very dear to her and a very talented actor as well, of course.  Other stars spotted at the party include Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, Nicole Richie, Scott Eastwood and Hailee Steinfeld.

"This is the moment comedian George Lopez filmed himself 'urinating' on President Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood walk of fame - but the footage is not all as it seems.  The comedian was seen crouching next to the brass plaque on Hollywood Boulevard as a stream of water flowed from between his legs in the video published on Wednesday by TMZ.  However, on closer inspection Lopez - whose face was scrunched up in a mock grimace - was carrying a small bottle of water which he was using to mimic the act.  The comedian was seen crouching next to the brass plaque on Hollywood Boulevard as a stream of water flowed from between his legs in the video published on Wednesday  Lopez is well known for his jibes against the President and was last year booed off stage at a charity gala in Denver after his anti-Trump jokes fell flat with the crowd, who had paid $5,000 to $100,000 for tables.  One of the event's largest donors, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei, was sitting in the front row and asked Lopez to stop with the anti-Trump jokes.  'George was asked nicely to stop making Trump jokes by a man in front row [Maffei] who just donated $250K,' a commentator on YouTube who was at the event said.  Trump's Hollywood star has been the focus of several protests since he was elected President.  Lopez (left, in Hollywood on Wednesday) is well known for his jibes against the President (right, after a NATO summit in Belgium on Thursday) and was last year booed off stage at a charity gala in Denver after his anti-Trump jokes fell flat with the crowd  In 2016, Los Angeles Police arrested a man who pleaded no contest to destroying Trump's star with a sledgehammer and pickax.  James Otis later told reporters: 'Upon reflection after my arrest, I had said I was proud and felt very good about destroying Mr. Trump's star. However, now I realize I was wrong, that I shouldn't have done it.'  He was given 20 days of community labor and agreed to pay $4,400, CBS News reported.",0

"The FDA has published conclusive proof on their website that the DTap vaccine can cause autism.According to the FDA’s online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.In this sense, it should be noted that:Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.What’s in Tripedia that probably can interfere with brain chemistry and neurology?According to the Tripedia’s package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.What is the content of these two growth mediums?Mueller and Miller medium, contains:Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution. Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 μg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process. Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 μg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde. The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.“Probable cause” ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG—an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.You might be wondering:Why some of the doctors don’t say anything about the risk of DTaP Vaccine?That is a question that many of us, still wondering! Maybe they just is just not convenient for them that we know about the risk of these vaccine.To take the vaccine debacle further, most of the mandated vaccines for infants and children, contain many of the above ingredients, which must be stopped from being injected into infants, toddlers, teens and even adults!It’s time for Congress to rescind the “Get out of Jail Free” card for vaccine makers and stop the aggressive onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children of a fulfilling life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically to the point of parents divorcing because of the stresses of ASD in a family.It’s about time vaccines are publicly acknowledged by the feds and the media for all the health damages they have caused. Just check out the CDC’s VAERS reports and the vaccine damage payouts by the HHS/HRSA. According to a new report published on March 1, 2017, by the department of health and human services of the United States, about $ 3,363,282,409.21 have been paid for vaccine adverse reactions and deaths from 1989 to 2017 so far.Тhis is a very controversial topic today.

"Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have ended their relationship once again, at least temporarily.  Reports have surfaced suggesting that the pair, who reunited in 2017 after nearly five years apart that was plagued with reconciliation rumors, are taking some time for themselves.  On March 11, 2018, Us Weekly reported that multiple sources confirmed the news of their split.  Rumors are swirling about the reasons for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's recent breakup  In addition to various reports about Justin and Selena's breakup itself, a number of different theories about their reason for taking time apart have surfaced. None have been confirmed by either pop star, but that's done little to quell the chatter among their respective fan bases.  So why did Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez call it quits this time?  Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey  During their second go at love, countless outlets reported that Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, was less than thrilled that her daughter had decided to give supposedly-reformed bad boy Justin Bieber another chance.  Those theories have picked up steam in the wake of their alleged split.  A source told Us Weekly: 'It's been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications.'  However, People magazine's sources have refuted these claims.  'They have their own issues and are always on and off. She wouldn't base her relationship off what her mom thinks,' a source said.  So apparently Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are on a break and all I can picture Justin singing ""What Do You Mean?"" — Maddie (@maddie_harper99) March 14, 2018  Selena Gomez's family  It's not just Mandy that's not on board with the Biebs. According to Us, Selena Gomez's entire family had qualms about her and Justin Bieber getting back together.  The source said: 'Justin's family loves Selena, but Selena's family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don't trust Justin.  'Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed...but her family just isn't budging right now.'  E! shared a similar report, claiming 'family pressure' and other issues led to their breakup.  'She's on a break with Justin partly because of family pressure but also because of some issues surrounding his birthday,' a source said.  'She wanted to have a quiet birthday celebration with Justin and he wanted to go big and involve all of his church friends. They had a disagreement that didn't end well.'  jelena is fine. they hate the media and are doing everything they can to avoid it. and there’s nothing wrong with that because they have nothing to prove to anyone. stop being so negative and good night �� — . (@biebsftlife) March 15, 2018  Justin Bieber's attitude  Amid rumors that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber called it quits, Us reported that Justin's attitude may have been a contributing factor in the demise of their rekindled romance.  '[He] doesn't care about anyone but himself,' a source said.  'The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn't need him.'  Infidelity  A rumor is swirling among Justin and Selena fans on Twitter that Justin was unfaithful to Selena. Some seem to believe the once-troubled singer had something going on with Petra Collins, whom Selena recently unfollowed on Instagram.  That rumor hasn't been substantiated, however. Especially considering it appears Petra is spending time with newly-single Justin Theroux.  They didn't break up  While many outlets are reporting that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have definitely decided to take some time apart, others claim they're still going strong.  Entertainment Tonight maintains the duo are still dating, but that Selena is taking a little time for herself to avoid outside pressure that stems from all the attention the two get.  A source said: 'Selena is very delicate; her ""comeback"" to the spotlight has been tough — especially with the interest in her personal life with Justin and her mother.  Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber spotted leaving the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, California together despite breakup rumors. pic.twitter.com/Ey7aHofjbT — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) March 8, 2018  'She is taking time to herself. This is not the first time she has done this.'  The insider added: 'She wants to repair her relationship with her mother, that's a priority for her, too. She needs to figure out how to live the life she wants in the spotlight — if that's even possible.'  This theory appears to be popular among fans of both Justin and Selena, who believe they're still together but are in hiding. Some tweeters seem to think the couple simply don't like the media circus surrounding their relationship, so they're laying low.  This theory does seemingly hold up, as both Justin and Selena have complained about paparazzi attention in the past.  Will Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber get back together?  A recent report from People magazine suggests that reconciliation is imminent for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. Their sources say fans should expect to see that sooner, rather than later.  'They've been having disagreements, but it wouldn't be surprising if they're back together in a week,' the Jelena insider said.  Similarly, E! reported that this is 'likely not the end' for Selena and Justin.  Selena Gomez will be 75 years old and still on again/off again with Justin Bieber. I hope they don't procreate. — CJ (@TheTweetsOfCJ) March 15, 2018  A source said: '[Selena] wanted some time to clear her head and get away before figuring out what's coming next.'  Another added: 'They will absolutely get back together and they are not over, but they both need some time away from each other.'  Justin Bieber-Selena Gomez relationship history  Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have a long, somewhat-sordid history that dates back to about 2010.  The pair, who met in 2009, were spotted out together sharing a meal at a Philadelphia IHOP in 2010, which prompted rumors about the status of their relationship.  At the time, Selena told Us: 'It was just pancakes!'  So basically jelena is still dating but just hangs out in completely private places. They’re not broken up y’all need to relax. — chloe (@biebcum) March 14, 2018  Not long after that sighting, Selena and Justin were seen looking couple-like at a concert in Miami, however, Justin told MTV he was 'just having fun being a teenager'.  In January 2011, things between Justin and Selena heated up and they were seen locking lips during a vacation in St. Lucia.  The following month they were photographed together during Vanity Fair's Oscars after-party in Hollywood, California. They held hands at the event, essentially confirming that they were a couple.  They looks so sad. It is obvious that Jelena broke up pic.twitter.com/cV9RuvoI4Z — Ann (@Guccifloralhs) March 15, 2018  In September 2011, Justin rented out the Staples Center for just himself and Selena. The pair enjoyed a private screening of Titanic. Afterward, Justin tweeted: 'Romance isn't dead.'  For Valentine's Day in 2012, Justin gifted Selena with a ring bearing a diamond encrusted J, which she proudly showed off on Twitter.  In April of that same year, the couple was caught on kiss cam while enjoying a Lakers game together. They pair obliged, but Selena later told Ryan Seacrest it was 'the most humiliating thing'.  Their love story came to a screeching halt in November 2012. The pair reportedly decided to take some time apart due to 'busy schedules'.  Rumors began swirling about them again in April 2013, when Justin shared a photo of himself shirtless in bed being snuggled by Selena.  The following month they were seen sharing a kiss, while Selena's gal pal Taylor Swift looked on in disgust.  Social media remained rife with speculation about the pair, who were later spotted by TMZ taking a Segway cruise around Calabasas, California, together.  Selena and Justin both dated other people while broken up, but eventually found their way back to one another.",1
"Into You Like a Train Season 2 Episode 6 A train crash brings many victims to the ER. Episode Information Airdate October 30, 2005 Written by Krista Vernoff Directed by Jeff Melman Episode Guide Previous Next Bring the Pain Something to Talk About  “ In general, people can be categorized in one of two ways — those who love surprises and those who don't. I don't. I've never met a surgeon that enjoys a surprise, because as surgeons, we like to be in the know. We have to be in the know, because when we aren't, people die and lawsuits happen. Am I rambling? I think I'm rambling. Okay, so my point, actually, and I do have one, has nothing to do with surprises or death or lawsuits, or even surgeons. My point is this: whoever said ""What you don't know can’t hurt you"", was a complete and total moron. Because for most people I know, not knowing is the worst feeling in the world. Okay, fine. Maybe it's the second worst. As surgeons, there are so many things we have to know. We have to know we have what it takes. We have to know how to take care of our patients... and how to take care of each other. Eventually, we even have to figure out how to take care of ourselves. As surgeons we have to be in the know.

Full Summary Edit  Meredith is seated at the bar talking to Joe. She asks him if she really asked Derek to choose her. Joe thinks it's romantic to which Meredith replies, ""It's not romantic, Joe. It's horrifying. Horror-movie horrifying. Carrie at the prom with the pig's blood, horrifying!"" Cristina and George are shooting darts several feet away with Izzie seated at a table beside them. Cristina wonders how long Meredith is going to wait. Izzie says it's getting hard to watch. Cristina says that now the situation is pathetic. Meredith hears her and drunkenly says, ""Who's pathetic? You who pretend to be my friends calling me pathetic behind my back, in front of my face. Why don't you just dump the pig's blood on me now and get it over with."" She is losing hope that Derek is coming. All of the interns start getting pages and a man in the bar says to turn on the television. On the news, there is a train wreck. The train was bound for Vancouver and had over 300 passengers. Izzie complains that they just worked a thirty hour shift. George says he does not have clean underwear. Meredith starts to pick up her stuff and Joe tells her she can't leave, that she should at least have a cup of coffee. Cristina pokes her head in the door and calls her. Meredith tells Joe, ""Maybe it's for the best. Maybe I don't want to know."" Joe does not agree.  Ambulances pour in with patients from the train accident. The interns rush past and head into the hospital.  Derek walks into the bar. He looks around for Meredith. Joe sees him and says, ""Dude, you're late."" Derek gets a page.  Cristina, Alex, Izzie, George, and Meredith are in the elevator. Izzie looks at Alex puzzled and Meredith looks very drunk, she stumbles out of the elevator. George and Cristina are very excited at the possible procedures they will get to see and perform. Alex says to Izzie, ""I thought you weren't talking to me."" They are all putting on the yellow protective gowns. Izzie tells him that she is rising above because it seems like he needs a friend after George's success in the elevator surgery. George accidentally hits Cristina's head with his elbow. Bailey walks up to them in a formal dress. They all look at her in a little bit of surprise. Meredith is just leaning against a wall staring into space. Bailey hands Alex her purse and tells him to get her shoes. She starts to put on a yellow gown and passes Meredith. Meredith says, ""Hello. I seem to be a little bit drunk. I was off duty."" Bailey angrily replies, ""So was I. Anybody else half in the bottle?"". The rest of the interns say no. Bailey tells Meredith to stay out of the way for now and the other interns go with Bailey to get their assignments. She tells them to not make any mistakes because they are tired. Bailey pushes open a door and there are many injured people. Cristina happily says, ""I'm so not tired anymore."" George says he's not either. Meredith sees Addison with a patient. Addison asks Bailey for an intern and assigns Izzie. Meredith is definitely not pleased at the sight of Addison. Nurse Tyler walks in and says to Meredith, ""Joe told me to tell you that McSteamy came looking for you."" She corrects him and says McDreamy. Derek walks into the room and looks at Meredith. George asks Cristina if that means he picked Meredith. She says, ""If it does, I just lost 50 bucks."" A paramedic runs in with an amputeed leg. Cristina says she wants that case. Richard walks in with the man missing a leg and Bailey assigns Cristina.  Chief sees Derek and tells him to clear him for surgery. There is a train wreck and they need everyone available. Derek asks him several questions about having headaches and dizziness. Richard says in a stern manner that he hasn't. Derek and Richard walk past Meredith, Derek nods at her. George comes over and asks what the nod meant. Meredith doesn't know. George asks out loud, ""Am I invisible?"" because he does not have a case yet.  Alex comes in and gives Bailey her shoes. Meredith is leaning against the wall watching all of the commotion around her.  On a gurney, a man and a woman are wheeled past her. They have a metal pole through their torsos connecting them together.  Inside, the man and woman with a pole through them are being examined. Just outside the room, a paramedic is telling Burke and Bailey about the two patients. The man, in his early 50's named Tom, has a steady blood pressure. The woman, in her 20's named Bonnie, is doing significantly worse. Inside, a drunk Meredith looks at the pole in awe. The woman asks, ""Is the craziest thing you've ever seen?"" She says it is. Bailey looks at Meredith sternly. Bailey asks the paramedic how things were at the scene. The paramedic said there were not a lot of survivors then leaves. Burke tells Bailey to get X-rays and various labs done. Unfortunately, they cannot fit in the C.T. so they are going to ""go in blind"". Bonnie asks Burke and Bailey inside and ask if they are going to remove the pole soon, Tom amusingly adds that it is a ""touch uncomfortable"". Burke apologizes, they cannot remove it until they know how things are going internally. He says they will work as quickly as possible. Bonnie asks if anyone has a breath mint. They all look around at her and each other. She says that the mint is for her not for Tom. Bailey tells George to get them X-rays but to move them extremely carefully. Meredith says, ""You go, George"", before she, Alex, and Bailey leave the room. Alex looks at him with a scowl.  Bailey tells Alex to cover the E.R. while he gets over his new fear of scalpels. He leaves to do that. Meredith tells Bailey, ""That was mean, even for you."" Bailey realizes that she is, in fact, drunk. She tells Meredith to give herself a banana bag I.V., not to talk to patients, and not to practice any medicine. Meredith thinks she should just go home. Bailey tells her she'll be sober in a few hours and if she, Bailey, cannot go home, no one can. She leaves Meredith and mumbles under her breath, ""Ten years of marriage and I didn't even get to finish my damn lobster.""  George and several other physicians are wheeling Tom and Bonnie on their way for their tests. George asks them if there is anyone he can call. Tom says they called his wife from the ambulance, Bonnie's fiance was called and their significant others' are flying from Vancouver together. Tom says that normally his wife would be very upset that he's pressed up against another woman but he thinks he'll get a pass this time. George asks whether they travelled together. Bonnie says they just met and that Tom has very nice pores. Tom chuckles and notes how it is painful to laugh. There is a long line for X-rays. George calls the attention of another intern. He sees them and let's them go ahead. George clears his throat behind another intern, she sees and let's them pass despite having patients themselves.  Addison and Izzie are with the pregnant woman, Brooke, involved in the train accident. The patient has burns along her neck extending down to her belly. Izzie stares at Addison. Addison sees from the corner of her eye and asks if Izzie needs something. Izzie says she doesn't. The woman has a contraction. Addison tells Izzie to book an O.R. because Brooke is in no condition to push and the baby is in distress. Addison will have to perform a C-section. Brooke asks if she can call a lawyer because she does not have a will and there's no father. Addison tells her there is not need for alarm and that there's time for her to make the necessary arrangements.  Izzie walks past Alex giving a woman, Mary, stitches on her forehead. She has a friend, Yvonne, with her whose phone keeps ringing. She insists to everyone who calls that they're fine. She tells them a red neck tried to beat the train and the train hit his vehicle. Alex asks Mary if the stitches hurt or if anything else is in pain. He overhears more of Yvonne's conversation. Yvonne seems to be insensitive to the people who did not survive the wreck. Mary says the area around her stomach hurts because some luggage fell and hit her. There's a large bruise. Alex says they're going to get her X-rays just in case there are internal injuries. Yvonne sees them go and gets off the phone. She wonders where they are going. Alex tells her, Yvonne calls Alex a little boy because he does not look much older than her eldest son. She says, ""Are you sure you're a doctor?"" as her cell phone rings again. She holds her finger up then answers her phone. She tells the person that she and Mary are fine and starts on the red neck story again. They leave.  Izzie walks past an area with a drawn curtain. She hears a woman say, ""Ow"", over and over again. Izzie draws the curtains back. It's Meredith. Izzie asks her what she's doing. Meredith says she's ""inserting her banana bag, which sounds vaguley dirty but it isn't."" Izzie smiles and draws the curtains around them. Izzie offers to insert the banana bag for her. Meredith asks, ""So how's it going with Addison? Bad mood? Good mood? 'Yay my husband picked me mood'?"" Izzie replies, ""I think it's more of a 'I hate the smell of charred flesh' mood."" Meredith says, ""Before you judge me, I know there was a train accident. People are very badly hurt. And that I'm a vapid narcissist when you mix me with alcohol. In case you were wondering, I know that."" Izzie says, ""Well, for what it's worth, I take issue with her salmon colored scrubs. I mean what self respecting surgeon wears salmon colored scrubs?"" Meredith says, ""This is what I'm saying."" They both smile and Izzie leaves.  Richard and Derek are performing surgery on the man with a missing leg. Cristina is cleaning out the leg they are going to put back. Richard is pleased because it was a clean sever. The man will probably have full function of his leg eventually. On a tray, there are several pagers and one goes off. It is for Derek. Richard squints his eyes a bit. Derek asks if he's okay. Richard says he's fine and is only adjusting to the light. Derek says there's no shame in taking time off to recover. Richard tells him he's fine and that Derek should go because he is needed elsewhere. He tells them to page him if he's needed here. Richard tells Cristina she can help him when she's finished cleaning the wound. Cristina pauses for a few seconds. Chief if asks if it's clean. She says that it's clean. Richard takes offense because he thinks Cristina is there just to keep an eye on him. He gives her a short lecture then asks if they have a problem. She says they do. He gets the wrong idea. Cristina insists she's happy to be there assisting him but the leg she is cleaning is a left leg when the patient needs a right one. Richard tells her to find the right leg.  George, Bailey, Burke, and Meredith are inside as Derek walks in. George notes how the pole goes right through her spine. Derek sees Meredith's I.V. and asks what happened. She replies, ""Tequila."" Bailey tells him that she's keeping an eye on her. Burke says the pole is on line with Tom's interior vena cava, while it is against Bonnie's aorta. They cannot remove the pole or else they will both bleed out. Burke suggests that they don't move the pole, that they move one of the patients so they can saw through it. George asks, ""Which would you move?"" Burke says that Bonnie's chance for survival is very slim because of the damage to her aorta, so moving her is the best choice so they can save Tom's life. Derek says it could go another way, that since Tom's more stable they could move him to give her a chance. Meredith says, ""So basically whoever you move doesn't stand a chance. So how do you choose? How do you decide who gets to live?""  Burke says they need to make a decision soon to have a chance at saving Tom and Bonnie. Derek says he wants to examine them before providing his input. Burke tells him to page him when he's through, then leaves. Derek starts to address Meredith as if to assign her something. Bailey interrupts and says Meredith needs a blood alcohol test before practicing any medicine. She says that she's totally fine, extends her arms and starts touching her nose with her index finger alternating arms. Bailey looks at Derek who then walks away. Meredith insists that she is fine. Bailey says, ""Regretting that last shooter about now, aren't you?""  Cristina is rummaging through an ambulance as a paramedic approaches. She asks Cristina what she's doing. Cristina starts to talk about how the patient with an amputeed leg does not have the right leg to put back on. The paramedic takes offense because she did not bring in that patient and says that Cristina did not differentiate between paramedics. Cristina says she cannot straddle another giant ego, she's already ""doing the splits"". She gets off the ambulance and says she needs the right leg or else the chief of surgery is going to take away her ""pretty blue scrubs"". The paramedic says there were multiple decapitations in the dining car and that the guy can live without his leg. Cristina says, ""This is so not about the leg or the guy."" She sarcastically thanks the paramedic for all that she does. Cristina walks back into the hospital.  Alex is treating another patient, Jana, who happens to be pregnant. A few feet away is Yvonne on the phone again talking about the red neck. Alex draws the curtain around himself as if to block her out. Alex tells her she should have minimal scarring. Jana asks if her friend is okay, she was pregnant also but put into a different ambulance. Alex says if she's not there she's probably in maternity. The woman gets up so she can go see her friend. She says her baby is fine because it's kicking. Alex follows her.  Meredith is seated in a wheelchair as George tries to draw her blood. Meredith says, ""Ow"", twice. She adds how he operated on a heart earlier so drawing blood should be no problem. He says he rocked the heart and that he's strung out on the scalpel. Meredith says there's nothing wrong with that. George smiles then gets a serious expression on his face. He asks if there's news about Derek. Meredith can't read him. George applauds her for even giving him a choice. He says that Derek is crazy if he doesn't pick Meredith. Cristina approaches them and hopes that they have seen a cleanly cut right leg. George says he hasn't. Meredith asks, ""How weird is this job?"" George whispers, ""Weird.""  Addison is standing next to Brooke's hospital bed as Jana comes in. They are happy to see one another. Alex comes in. Addison asks if Jana was on the train. Izzie comes into the room. Alex says she was on the train. Addison asks him whether he gave her the appropriate tests to ensure the health of the baby. She is upset that Jana is wandering around the hospital. Addison tells him to leave so he goes. Addison tells Izzie that it was very irresponsible even for an intern, then asks if Izzie disagrees. Izzie says, ""She wanted to see her friend. What was he supposed to do, tackle her?"" Addison tells Izzie to get Jana into a bed.  Derek is examining Bonnie and Tom. He runs something against her foot and asks if she can feel it. She says that Derek is cute and cute doctors can call her by her first name. Derek does it again and asks if she can feel it. She says, ""Feel what?"", then realizes she doesn't. George comes into the room and gives Derek the lab results. He tells Tom to wiggle his toes. He is successful and Derek tells him so. Tom is very happy. Bonnie asks Derek if her toes are moving. George looks down at her foot. Her toes don't move but Derek tells her they did. She says, ""Yay me!"" Tom asks Derek if they are going to live through this. Bonnie says that it is a morose thing to say. Derek says they are going to do everything they can.  Cristina comes into the O.R. with a leg wrapped in a pink plastic bag. Richard says it's about time she arrived. Cristina apologizes but says she took the liberty of checking the wound herself. A scrub nurse shows the leg to Richard. There is red nail polish on the toes, the leg belongs to a woman. Chief looks at Cristina. She stutters a bit and says she'll go find the correct leg. She leaves quickly.  George and Derek are looking at X-rays as Bailey and Burke come in. Burke asks what the situation is. Derek says that Tom has better odds at surviving. Bailey tells George to tell O.R. 1 that they are coming. Burke adds that he should close the gallery, they don't need an audience for this procedure. George looks very sad. He says, ""She's cracking jokes. How do you tell someone she's going to be dead in a few minutes when she's sitting up, cracking jokes?""  Mary is lying in bed and Yvonne is seated in a chair next to her. Yvonne asks Alex if they can get out of the hospital soon. Alex tells them labs and radiology are all backed up and Mary can't be discharged until they rule out internal injuries for Mary. Yvonne's cell phone rings again. With an attitude she tells the person that they're still at the hospital because the doctor, Alex, is useless. Alex looks at her disappointed then walks away past Cristina. Cristina is on the phone looking for the leg. She asks the person to sift through the carnage to look for the right leg. They hang up on her. Burke comes, apparently Cristina paged him. She says if she doesn't find the right leg then Richard is going to cut her from the program. She does not want to go back to Los Angeles because it's sunny every day. Burke just continues to look at her puzzled. Cristina says, ""You're my boyfriend! I mean, I know I don't have much experience with this kind of thing but, aren't boyfriends supposed to help in situations like this?"" Burke smiles but says that since they're on duty he can't be her boyfriend. She says, ""Okay, so when we're on duty I can have sex with someone else?"" In a very pleasant manner he says, ""Dr. Yang, I'm walking away now."" Cristina says when she's kicked out of the program he'll probably rethink not helping her.  Alex and Meredith are standing in a doorway and they are in the middle of a conversation. Alex is telling her about Addison calling him out in front of a patient. Meredith asks if she yelled. Alex says she didn't. After a pause he says, ""Fine, she's Satan's whore."" Meredith asks if he yelled back to her. He says he didn't. Meredith says, ""Dude, you lost your mojo."" Alex says, ""Excuse you."" Meredith says she was trying to talk like one of the guys. Alex says, ""O'Malley plugs a hole with his finger and everyone walks around like he's some kind of hero. I have one off day.."" Meredith thinks he chickened out. Alex says he ""hesitated briefly."" Meredith asks why he did not kiss Izzie. Alex says, ""And now I'm leaving."" Before he has a chance, Cristina comes and says, ""It's not in the morgue. I've looked in the ambulances and the ER. How is one bloody hairy leg gonna destroy my career?"" She quickly leaves. Alex's lab results are ready. He gets them and starts to walk away. Meredith tells him she hopes he gets his mojo back because she finds him ""disturbing without it"". He hopes he finds it too. She hits the back of her head against the wall and says, ""Ow.""  Derek, George, and Bailey are with Tom and Bonnie. Derek is explaining that it is difficult because at the moment their bodies are in shock, which prevents them from feeling the pain of their injuries. Burke comes into the room. Bonnie says she didn't expect to walk out of there any time soon, after all, they have a metal pole going through their insides. She'd rather Derek says what he needs to say. He says that in order to operate on Tom, they need to be separated; that they would have to move her backwards off the pole. Tom asks if the doctors could just pull the pole out of both of them. Burke responds that doing so would cause them both to bleed too quickly because at its current position, the pole is plugging the wounds. When the pole is removed, the organs would shift. Bonnie, in a sad yet calm tone says, ""So, if you move me, I'll die?"" Derek says they'll do everything they can to save her. Tom says no, he thinks if anyone should be moved it's him. Burke tells him that his injuries are less extensive. Derek strokes Bonnies hand. Tom exclaims, ""It's not right. It's not right."" Bonnie closes her eyes then says, ""Tom, it's not fair either way."" He looks off into the distance. Bonnie asks if her fiance, Danny, is there yet. George says there are delays at the airport because of a storm. Bailey says they could wait but the longer they wait, the higher the risk of infection. Bonnie says it's better this way because Danny wouldn't understand, it would be too hard for him to grasp everything so quickly.  Addison and Izzie are treating Brooke. Jana is seated in a wheel chair right by her side. Patricia comes into the room with two clip boards. She asks if someone asked for a notary. Brooke says she asked for a lawyer. Patricia says she could not get one at this time of night but the hospital's forms should take care of what she needs. She explains that Brooke's child would be placed into the custody of whoever she specifies in case of death or permanent vegetative state. Jana is confused and asks who is dying. Addison explains that there's some danger because of the trauma and the burns. Jana think it's ridiculous. Brooke says it's necessary, just in case, so that their son doesn't end up with her mother. Jana quickly and eagerly takes the clipboard from Patricia. Izzie asks how long they have been together. Brooke replies, ""Since third grade."" Jana continues and explains that they aren't lovers but best friends, they wanted their children to grow up with two parents. They both used the same sperm donor making their children brother and sister. Jana's water breaks. They move into action.  Alex tells Mary she has a broken rib, she'll need some pain killers but other than that she's fine. Yvonne is laying her head at the end of the bed as her phone rings again. Mary tells her to answer the phone. She tries to nudge her awake. Yvonne falls from the chair she is seated in. Mary is very concerned. Alex calls a code blue and asks for help. Alex and four others are trying to revive Yvonne. Yvonne has lost too much blood. Mary is confused because she doesn't see any blood. The nurse explains she was bleeding internally for hours. Alex says that Yvonne didn't say anything, that he didn't know. A nurse says that Yvonne is gone, she has a flat line. Mary refuses to believe it. Alex calls her time of death, 2:51, and leaves the room very upset.  Addison introduces Jana to Dr. Hoffman who will take over delivering her baby. She walks back to Brooke and Izzie hands her Brooke's chart. Addison says they need to go to the operating room now. Brooke says they were supposed to give birth together. Jana tells Brooke that it's okay, she should go and enjoy her C-section and the drugs that go along with it. She says that her vagina is definitely not having fun. Brooke does not want Jana to be alone. Addison says that Izzie is a surgeon. Izzie says that it's all right and she'll stay. Addison looks pleased Izzie is willing to give up a surgery for the benefit of a patient. As Brooke is wheeled out, Jana tells her to stay alive. Brooke says, ""You too.""  Alex is angry at himself for the death of Yvonne. He yells, ""Damn it!"" then sits on a bench. A paramedic comes to him with the leg that Richard has been looking for. Alex thanks him and Alex looks very happy. He heads back into the hospital. Cristina walks in and starts to apologize to Richard for not being able to find the leg. She sees that they are operating. She asks if they found the leg. Alex turns to Cristina and says that he found it. Richard tells Cristina she missed out this time but they could probably use her help in the E.R. She looks at Alex with the deepest loathing.  Tom and Bonnie are being prepared for surgery. Bonnie quietly asks Tom if he believes in heaven. He says he does, then asks Bonnie if she does. Bonnie says that she wants to. Tom starts to say something. Bonnie starts to cry then says, ""Shhh. I know."" She rubs his shoulder. He has tears in his eyes. Derek introduces them to the anesthesiologist. Bonnie asks if it is going to hurt. They say she won't feel a thing. She asks if Derek is the one who is going to talk to Danny. He smiles and says yes, then asks what she wants Derek to tell him. She starts whispering in his ear. Bailey, George, and Burke are scrubbing in for Bonnie and Tom's surgery. Bailey wonders aloud, ""Why do I feel like we're about to kill this girl?"" Meredith comes in and says that she is sober according to her labs then asks if she can scrub in. Burke tells her to do it quickly. Bailey and Burke go into the O.R. as Derek walks out and into the scrub room. Meredith sees him then looks at George, whispers his name as if to say 'Give us a minute.' George finishes washing his hands then goes into the O.R. Meredith and Derek greet each other. Derek says he went to the bar. Meredith says she heard. Derek looks at her then looks away. Meredith looks down as he asks if she took some aspirin to help with a hangover. He starts to wash his hands and Meredith says, ""Oh, you're staying with her."" Derek is silent for a few moments then says, ""She's my wife."" Bailey calls to Derek and says that Bonnie is crashing. He walks into the O.R. followed by Meredith. Derek asks what happened. They determine that the pole must have shifted. They start to move Bonnie off the pole. Burke tells George to hold the pole in place. They start to count ""One, two...""  ""...Three."" Izzie is seated on Jana's bed holding her hand as Dr. Hoffman delivers her baby. Izzie counts again, ""One, two...""  Addison is operating on Brooke. Her baby is wedged under her ribs. They need to pull him out. Addison starts to count, ""One, two...""  Bonnie is slid off the pole and placed on an operating table. They start to cut the excess pole with a saw. Tom is stable so they begin operating on Bonnie. Derek and Burke are working as quickly as they can on her with Meredith and Bailey retracting. Burke reaches inside and says that her aorta is shredded and she's bleeding out. Tom is losing pressure and so everyone, with the exception of Meredith, moves to work on him. Meredith yells, ""What about her? We can't just abandon her! We can't just abandon her!"" Meredith continues to work on Bonnie. Bailey and George both call her to work on Tom. Meredith continues saying they cannot abandon Bonnie, they have an obligation. Bailey walks over to her and says there was too much damage, there was nothing they could do. She says they have to let her go. Bailey calls her time of death, 3:49. Meredith remains by Bonnie's side.  Jana is laying in bed, her daughter is in her baby bed next to Jana's bed. Addison comes in and Izzie asks how Brooke is doing. Addison says she and her son are doing fine. They walk out into the hallway. Addison asks, ""So, have you made a decision yet, Dr. Stevens?"" Izzie is confused. She says, ""Whether or not you're going to hate me. You're Meredith's friend? I'm the wicked witch who came in and ruined her life and cheated on Doctor, wait, what is it that you guys call him?"" Izzie reluctantly answers, ""McDreamy."" Addison asks if it embarrasses him. Izzie thinks it does. Addison says that by all rights Izzie should hate her, but she's staying in town for a while. Izzie looks down realizing that must mean Derek chose Addison. Addison says Izzie has a gift for her specialty and she has a lot she could teach Izzie if she wants to learn. She adds, ""So, when you decide how important it is for you to hate me, let me know."" Addison walks away. Izzie sighs.  Derek is with Bonnie's fiance, Danny. They are seated in the waiting room. Bailey is seated next to Derek. George and Meredith are standing several feet away within ear shot. Danny asks if Bonnie suffered. Derek says she was not in any pain. Derek continues, ""She asked me to tell you.. She wanted you to know that if love were enough, that if love were enough that she'd still be here with you."" Meredith looks at them in sadness then walks away. George looks at her go.  Richard and Alex follow the patient as he is being wheeled out. Richard compliments Alex on his fine work. He thanks Richard. Jana is in a rocking chair feeding her daughter. Addison lifts Brooke's son from his baby bed and holds him next to Brooke. Izzie has a big smile on her face as she holds his bottle.  Tom is asleep in bed. Burke tells his wife that Tom is doing fine. She gives him a hug.  Bailey and Derek are inside the elevator. Derek is obviously very distraught. Bailey senses it and pulls on the stop button. Derek walks to the back of the elevator and grasps the rail. He wipes his face then stands next to Bailey again. She asks if he's okay. He says he is. She pushes in the button. They both walk out.  Izzie, Meredith, and George are seated on a bench. Alex puts on his white coat and opens the door to leave. Cristina walks in and glares at him. Cristina sits down next to Meredith who looks very sad.  Derek and Addison walk out of the hospital. Addison links their arms together.  Meredith, Cristina, Izzie, and George look very tired on the bench. The door opens, Meredith looks to see who it is. Bailey is at the door. She tells them to get cleaned up, they have to do rounds in five minutes. They all stand up and go to their lockers.

They applied burn cream, but while she was being treated, she went into labor, so they had to take her in for a c-section.  Webber's Patient Edit  Diagnosis: Traumatic amputation    Treatment: Re-attachment    Webber took a patient in who had sustained a traumatic leg amputation in the train accident. He discovered that the leg that had been brought into the OR with them was not the leg the patient had lost. They eventually found the correct leg and it was successfully re-attached.  Diagnosis: Impalement injuries    Treatment: Surgery    Bonnie came into the ER impaled on a pole which was also impaling Tom Maynard. Her spine was crushed by the pole and the pole was hitting her aorta. They evaluated the odds of survival for both of them and determined that Bonnie had almost no chance of survival either way, so they felt she should be the one moved off the pole, to give Tom the best chance of survival he could get. Further testing revealed that Bonnie had no sensation in her feet and couldn't move her toes. Her spine was completely severed. They presented their plan to both Tom and Bonnie, who reluctantly agreed to the surgery. Once they were anesthetized, the pole shifted and Bonnie crashed. They pulled her off the pole and cracked her chest, but her aorta was shredded, so they quickly realized she was a lost cause.  Diagnosis: Impalement injuries    Treatment: Surgery    Tom was brought into the ER after being impaled by a pole which was also impaling Bonnie Crasnoff. The pole was pressed up against his vena cava. They evaluated the odds of survival for both of them and determined that Bonnie had almost no chance of survival either way, so they felt she should be the one moved off the pole, to give Tom the best chance of survival he could get. Because Bonnie's odds were so slim, they presented their plan to both Tom and Bonnie, who reluctantly agreed to the surgery. Once they were anesthetized, the pole shifted and Bonnie crashed, so the pulled her off the pole and opened her chest. They quickly saw that she was a lost cause, so they went back to Tom and they were able to repair his injuries and save his life.  Diagnosis: Facial laceration Broken rib    Treatment: Stitches    Mary came into the ER after the train accident. She had some facial lacerations, which were stitched up in the ER. She also had pain in one side, so Alex ordered x-rays to make sure nothing was broken and she had no internal injuries. The x-ray showed a broken rib, so she was given pain meds.  Diagnosis: Acute alcohol poisoning    Treatment: Fluids    Because she was drunk, Meredith was ordered to connect herself to a banana bag to hydrate herself. However, she couldn't insert it into herself, so Izzie helped.  Diagnosis: Laceration Pregnancy    Treatment: Stitches Vaginal delivery    Jana had a cut stitched up in the ER before heading up to maternity. While she was there, she went into labor and gave birth.  Diagnosis: Massive internal bleeding    Treatment: Attempted resuscitation    Yvonne collapsed after hours in the ER because she'd been bleeding internally the whole time.

This episode marks the introduction of Paramedic Ray Sutera.  The season 2 DVD set includes an audio commentary for this episode by director Jeff Melman and writer Krista Vernoff.  The line where George wonders if he's invisible was ad-libbed by T.R. Knight.  Alex refers to Addison as Satan's whore. The original script said bitch, but Justin Chambers felt like that was too generic for Alex, so Krista Vernoff had her assistants make up a list of non-generic alternatives. They then chose Satan's whore.  After Bonnie's pulled off the pole and laid on a table, there was a huge pool of blood under the table to show that Bonnie was actually bleeding out, but ABC wouldn't allow the crew to show it in the episode.  Originally, Danny was supposed to cry upon hearing that Bonnie had died.  Goof: The amount of liquid in the banana bag never changes.  Gallery Edit  Episode Stills Edit  Quotes Edit  Meredith: How do you choose which one gets to live?  Addison: So, have you made a decision yet, Dr. Stevens? Izzie: I'm sorry? Addison: Whether or not you're going to hate me. You're Meredith's friend? I'm the wicked witch who came in and ruined her life and cheated on Doctor...wait, what is it that you guys call him? Izzie: Uh— McDreamy... Addison: Right. God, doesn’t that embarrass him? Izzie: Yeah, I think it does. Addison: So, when you decide how important it is for you to hate me... Let me know.  Cristina: There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. Burke: What is it? Cristina: I need to find this man's leg. The chief is going to kick me out of the program if I don't. I cannot go back to Los Angeles. It's sunny there. Every day. (Burke smiles) You're my boyfriend! I mean, I know I don't have much experience with this kind of thing, but aren't boyfriends supposed to help in situations like this? Burke: Cristina, when we're on duty, I can't be your boyfriend. Cristina: Okay, so when we're on duty, I can have sex with someone else? Burke: Dr. Yang, I'm walking away now.  George: Is there any way to operate without separating them? Derek: No. George: But if we move the pole ... Bailey: They'll both bleed out. Burke: What if we don't move the pole? What if we move one of the patients off the pole to get the saw in there? Then we can hold the pole steady in the other one. Move it very slowly and repair the damage as we go. George: Who? Which would you move? Burke: With her aortic injuries, her chances of survival are extremely slim no matter what we do. But if we move her, we have a real shot of saving him. Derek: Well, I could argue since her injuries are so extensive, we should move him. Give her the best shot we can. Meredith: So basically, whoever you move doesn't stand a chance? So how do you choose? How do you decide who gets to live?  Bonnie: Dr. Shepherd, I don't know about Tom here, but I didn't expect to be walking out of here anytime soon, so if there's something you need to say, please just say it. Derek: Okay, Bonnie. In order to operate on Mr. Maynard, we have to separate you two. In order to do that, we have to move you backwards off the pole. Tom: Can't you just pull the pole out of both of us? Burke: No. If we did that, both of you would start bleeding very quickly. Too quickly. Right now, the pole is blocking your injuries. Once removed, your organs will shift. Bonnie: So if you move me off the pole, I'll die? Derek: We're going to do everything we can … Tom: No! No, if anyone has to go, it should be me, so you just move me … Burke: Mr. Maynard, your injuries are less extensive than Miss Crasnoff's. If we operate around the pole, you have a better chance of surviving. Tom: It's not right. It's not fair! Bonnie: Tom, it's not fair either way.  Bonnie: Do you believe in Heaven? Tom: Yes. Do you? Bonnie: I want to.  Derek: Dr. Grey. Bailey: Dr. Grey needs to get herself a blood alcohol test before practicing any medicine tonight. Meredith: What? No, I'm totally fine. Look. Totally fine. Derek: Right, okay. Meredith: I'm fine! Bailey: Regretting that last shooter about now, aren't you?  Meredith: You operated on a heart earlier, George. You'd think you could draw a little blood. George: I rocked that heart. Meredith: Yeah, you did!  See Also Edit  A complete overview of this episode's crew can be found here.",1

"Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!",1
"Jordan Feldstein, longtime manager of Maroon 5 and the brother of actor Jonah Hill, has died. He was 40. The cause of death was a heart attack, according to the Feldstein family. The Los Angeles County coroner confirmed Feldstein’s death.  Feldstein founded management company Career Artist Management (CAM), which was based out of the Live Nation offices in Beverly Hills. In addition to Maroon 5, the CAM roster includes Miguel, Elle King and Robin Thicke, among others. Feldstein negotiated Maroon 5’s Adam Levine’s coach role on NBC’s “The Voice.”  Feldstein got his start in the industry working for ICM and Bill Leopold Management. He and Maroon 5’s Levine were friends from childhood and Feldstein managed Maroon 5 from their inception, guiding the band as they became one of music’s most successful and universally popular international touring acts with three Grammy Awards and 20 million albums sold worldwide.  He is a father to two children and was previously married twice, once to Francesca Eastwood in 2013, the daughter of Clint Eastwood. The marriage was annulled.  A statement from the Feldstein family reads as follows:  Unfortunately, last night Jordan called 911 for shortness of breath, when paramedics arrived it was determined he went into full cardiac arrest and passed away shortly thereafter.  His family asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time.  In lieu of food and flowers, the family will announce a charity in the coming weeks where memorial donations can be made in Jordan’s name.  Live Nation and Roc Nation, with whom CAM was strategically aligned, also released a statement.  We are deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Jordan Feldstein and extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. Jordan was a gifted manager whose artists benefited greatly from his guidance and talents. He will be missed by his Live Nation and Roc Nation family.",0

"The Hamilton County sheriff’s website confirmed that the American television series Teen Mom’s Ryan Edwards got arrested in Tennessee on Tuesday.  The Teen Mom OG star’s arrest took place less than twenty-four hours after the fact that he and his wife Mackenzie Edwards are expecting their very first child together was revealed.  A source said in a statement about the arrest that it was related to his charge of last year before he went to rehab. The source added that it is not anything new and it is not a new arrest for heroin but it was his original charge of last April.  According to the reports, Ryan got arrested at his house on Tuesday when the cops executed a warrant for violating the probation. A spokesperson for Hamilton County Jail told that he was held on a bond of 5,000 dollars and that he was bonded out at about 10:15 pm.  On the night of Monday, the MTV viewers were shown a preview of the next week’s Teen Mom OG episode, in which Mackenzie was seen to be showing a producer a positive pregnancy test. On Tuesday, the same day as that of the arrest of Ryan, Mackenzie said in a statement that her husband, who also shares a son named Bentley with his ex Maci Bookout, is very excited about her pregnancy. Mackenzie even has got 4-year-old son named Hudson with her ex Zachary Stephens.  Ryan and Mackenzie tied the knot secretly in May 2017 before he went to the rehab. Several sources confirmed earlier in the month of June that Ryan had been in the rehab for around two weeks and that he was actually doing well. Ryan Edward’s stay in the rehab occurred shortly after the allegations of substance abuse were made on Teen Mom OG. The couple exchanged vows in a second ceremony in the month of November.",1
"Despite what Infinity War’s title might imply, all good things must come to an end. The latest Avengers and Ant-Man and the Wasp will be the last Marvel movies to stream on Netflix. Starting with Captain Marvel, MCU films will instead be viewable on Disney’s upcoming streaming service.  The news came as part of a story from the New York Times on the still-untitled streaming service.  “Starting with Captain Marvel in March, all of the films that Walt Disney Studios releases in theaters will subsequently flow to the Disney streaming platform instead of to Netflix,” the Times reported.  Disney’s streaming service is expected to launch late next year.  Why is Marvel doing this? Well, when Netflix streams an MCU movie, Disney, which owns Marvel, only gets a cut of the money, since the company licensed the film rights to a third party. But by taking all its toys back and putting them on its own streaming service exclusively, Disney gets all of the subscription money that fans will pay because it’ll be the only way to stream Avengers 4 or literally any other Disney movie. All the animated classics and new Star Wars movies will also live on Disney’s streaming service, to say nothing of all the new franchises the House of Mouse now owns after having bought Fox.  However, Marvel won’t be completely gone from Netflix come 2019. The New York Times reports that Netflix’s Marvel shows, like Daredevil and Luke Cage, will stay on Netflix for the time being, as a spokesman said there are “no current plans” to take them away.  Man … remember when everybody thought cord-cutting was going to save people a bunch of money? Instead of paying for cable, you could pay $9.99 a month for one streaming service that had everything you wanted on it. Except now you’re gonna have to pay $9.99 a month (or more) for Netflix, Hulu, Disney’s streaming service, CBS All Access, Amazon Prime, HBO Now, Showtime, and, eventually, Apple’s streaming service. That’s just the start.  Original What Are Marvel's 9 New Mystery Movies?  Anyway, check out Thor: Ragnarok on Netflix now.",0

The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.‘As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoD’s request for information about this “event”, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion– Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73—with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database “target hit” on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a “probable witness” against the Clinton Foundation.,‘Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jersey—and whose inclusion in the SVR’s database of “potential witnesses” against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a “central identified and named figure” in the creation of a document titled “Training Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine” for the New Jersey Department of Education.’‘Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis—that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death—and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)—and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its “emergency administration” led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase it—and their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.’‘Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a “main target” person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US history—that began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundation—and that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education—and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions—that, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses’ offices throughout the United States—with New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools—and that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their “EpiPen Law” that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.’‘Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Bresch—who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPens—became the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.—with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million—and whose “protection” for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchin’s husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.’‘To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her “active and knowing” participation in the United States opioid crisis—that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year—nearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma—who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a “blind eye” to their flooding of America with opioids—and as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin’s home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.’‘This report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in America, concludes with SVR analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the FBI task force investigating Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee—and that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in Knoxville, Tennessee—that was brought against the Clinton Foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III on behalf of the citizens of his State—and whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal:“Purdue’s own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push Tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of Oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers.Purdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of Oxycontin but created a false narrative – that long-term use of opioids didn’t create addicts but instead caused “pseudo addictive” symptoms.The groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids. Tennessee’s legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted.Purdue also used fake advocacy literature, such as pamphlets, videos, and social media, to convince the public that long-term use of opioids led to a higher “quality of life.”The firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how Oxycontin – Purdue’s financial rainmaker – was better for patients than other opioids on the market.”<img src=""https://media.8ch.net/file_store/b4a605f160e4e0f03903a232c185067ff24b83dd8a1f8b361f2be3dfc83dbdb3.jpeg"" style=""max-height:640px;max-width:360px;""><span style=""margin-top:15px;rgba(42,51,6,0.7);font-size:12px;"">Credit:<a href=""http://www.theeventchronicle.com/cabal-exposed/new-jersey-couple-set-to-testify-to-grand-jury-against-the-clintons-die-in-new-jersey-home-explosion-2/""> The Event Chronicle </a></spanAmerican nurse Carole Paladino (above) identified by SVR as being “probable witness” against ClintonFoundationRelated Coverage: <a href=""http://thegoldwater.com/news/29430""> Clinton Body Count Series: #1.

"'One Kardashian is enough!' How Anna Wintour 'banned' Kim's mom Kris Jenner from the Met Ball (and the Real Housewives weren't welcome either)    Anna Wintour may have welcomed Kim Kardashian to the Met Gala last week, but she apparently banned the pregnant star's mother from attending as well.  Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner was apparently 'desperate' to go to the punk-themed event, according to a Radaronline.com source, but the U.S. Vogue editor-in-chief is said to have issued a strict ban on any further reality stars.    She apparently told staff that 'one Kardashian is enough!'    'Banned': Anna Wintour (left) apparently refused to allow Kris Jenner (right) to attend the Met Gala  The source explained to the site: 'Anna approves every star who enters and although she finally relented on Kim, she drew the line at Kris, who was desperate to attend.  'Anna wants a parade of stars at the gala, not a parade of reality stars!'  According to Radar, Ms Wintour, 63, also refused to let the Real Housewives of New York buy a $250,000 table at the high fashion event.  'One Kardashian is enough!' Kris's pregnant daughter Kim attended the punk-themed event for the first time last week on the arm of boyfriend Kanye West  Though it seems Ramona Singer, Carole Radziwill, LuAnn de Lesseps, Heather Thomson, Sonja Morgan and Aviva Drescher would have been contributing to funds raised for the Met's Costume Institute, they apparently remain personae non gratae.  'Anna would never, ever allow a group of Real Housewives to rub shoulders with fashion’s elite,' the source said.  This is not the first rumor surrounding Ms Wintour's refusal to allow a Kardashian to attend the Met Gala.  Not welcome? Ms Wintour also apparently refused to let the Real Housewives of New York buy a $250,000 table at the high fashion event  Last year it was reported that Kim Kardashian had been banned from the guest list, and so beau Kanye West was seen walking the red carpet alone.  Now that Ms Kardashian is seven months' pregnant with her first child however, it appears that Ms Wintour's alleged dislike of the reality star has softened.",1

On June 7, the Mom star announced she is pregnant with twin boys with her longtime boyfriend Hamzi Hijazi. The news came a decade after she had her first child, son Dezi James, with ex Eric Calvo.  “Doing it 10 years older [is] really night and day!” Pressly admits, saying she feels “10 years wiser” and describing the feeling of carrying two children compared to one, “Having eight limbs moving around is something very alien.”  “There’s a lot more discomfort than there was with one,” she adds. “I’ve had a fairly easy pregnancy considering so many women go through so much worse, so I’ve been very, very lucky.”  Want all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

I’m not a sweet-tooth person, I’m a savory, and I’ve really been craving sweets, which is unusual for me.”  “I was bloated everywhere and all of a sudden went out and [it] just went straight into my belly, so I’m all belly [now],” says the star. “But I worked out … and then I had to slow down a little bit.”  When asked about how Dezi is adjusting, Pressly reveals he’s “so excited” about the idea of becoming a big brother. “He’s been begging for a sibling since kindergarten,” she says. “It’s about time!”  Jerod Harris/WireImage  RELATED: Picture Perfect!

Whereas now with twins, it comes with a play date.”  “I wanted a girl, but boys love their mamas and I’m a tomboy anyway, so it’s kind of fitting,” adds the My Name Is Earl alum.

"For other people named John Mahoney, see John Mahoney (disambiguation)  Charles John Mahoney (June 20, 1940 – February 4, 2018) was an English-American actor of stage, film, and television.  Born in Blackpool, England, Mahoney emigrated to the United States at the age of 18 and started his acting career on the stage in 1977, moving into film in 1980. He was best known for playing the blue-collar patriarch Martin Crane in the American sitcom Frasier, which aired on NBC from 1993 to 2004. In addition to his film and television work, Mahoney also worked as a voice actor and was particularly passionate about his stage work on Broadway and in Chicago theatre.  Early life [ edit ]  Mahoney was born in the Bispham area of Blackpool, England on June 20, 1940, the seventh of eight children. His paternal grandfather was Irish Catholic.[4][5]  The family had been evacuated to Blackpool from the Mahoneys' home city of Manchester, when it was heavily bombed during the Second World War. He started school at St Joseph's College, Blackpool. After the war, the family moved back to Manchester. Mahoney grew up in the Withington area of the city and discovered acting at the Stretford Children's Theatre. His father Reg was a baker[6] who played classical piano, and his mother Margaret (née Watson) was a housewife who loved reading. His parents' marriage was not happy and they either would not speak to each other or have heated arguments. The family situation, combined with the war, fueled Mahoney's interest in acting and he vowed to leave Manchester.[7][8]  Mahoney moved to the United States aged 18 in March 1959[9] when his older sister Vera, a war bride living in rural Illinois, agreed to sponsor him. He studied at Quincy University, Illinois, before joining the United States Army. After graduating from Quincy, he lived in Macomb, Illinois, earned his Master's degree in English [10]and taught English at Western Illinois University in the early 1970s,[11] before settling in Forest Park, Illinois, and later in Oak Park, Illinois. He became a US citizen in 1971[12] and served as editor of a medical journal through much of the 1970s.[11]  Career [ edit ]  Early work [ edit ]  Dissatisfied with his career, Mahoney took acting classes at St. Nicholas Theatre, which inspired him to resign from his day job and pursue acting full-time. After a stage production in Chicago in 1977, John Malkovich encouraged him to join the Steppenwolf Theatre.[13][14] He did so and went on to win the Clarence Derwent Award as Most Promising Male Newcomer. Gary Sinise said in an interview for Bomb Magazine that Lyle Kessler's play Orphans ""kicked John Mahoney, Kevin Anderson and Terry Kinney off into the movie business""[15] after their Steppenwolf performance of the play for which he won the Derwent Award and the Theatre World Award.[16] Mahoney won Broadway's Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves.[17]  Mahoney's first major film role was in the 1987 Barry Levinson film Tin Men. He went on to have prominent roles in a number of acclaimed films throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, including Moonstruck, Eight Men Out, Say Anything..., In the Line of Fire, Reality Bites, and The American President.[17][18][11] He appeared in two Coen brothers films, Barton Fink[19] and The Hudsucker Proxy.[20]  Frasier [ edit ]  Mahoney appeared in Frasier from its debut in 1993 until the final episode in 2004; Mahoney received two Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations for the role of Martin Crane, the father of Frasier Crane and Niles Crane. NBC executives held Mahoney in such high esteem that Warren Littlefield declared he was pre-approved when the Frasier creative team suggested casting him as the father.[21] Prior to appearing on the series, Mahoney had appeared in an episode of Cheers – from which Frasier was a spin-off – as an inept jingle writer who has a brief conversation with Frasier. Mahoney also appeared as a priest in Becker, which starred Cheers star Ted Danson.  Voice acting [ edit ]  Mahoney voice acting on September 7, 2007  Mahoney's first voice job was in W. B. Yeats's ""The Words upon the Window-Pane"" for the award-winning National Radio Theater of Chicago. He provided the voices for several characters in Antz (1998), Preston Whitmore in Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Atlantis: Milo's Return, General Rogard in The Iron Giant (1999), and Papi in Kronk's New Groove (but was succeeded by Jeff Bennett in The Emperor's New School for an unknown reason). In 2007, Mahoney provided the voice of Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Sr. (Sideshow Bob's father) in The Simpsons episode ""Funeral for a Fiend."" This reunited him with his Frasier co-stars Kelsey Grammer (Sideshow Bob) and David Hyde Pierce (Cecil, Sideshow Bob's brother).  Post-Frasier [ edit ]  Mahoney co-starred as the Old Man in the Broadway revival of Prelude to a Kiss at the American Airlines Theater in a limited-run engagement running from previews on February 17, 2007, through to April 29, 2007.[22][23] He appeared as an elderly drag queen in the ER season 13 episode ""Somebody to Love,"" and co-starred with Steve Carell (himself a veteran of Chicago theatre) as the father of Carell's character in Dan in Real Life. In March 2008, he opened in the world premiere of Better Late at the Northlight Theatre.[24] He was also the narrator for Midwest Airlines commercials. Mahoney also made two appearances on USA's Burn Notice in the second (2009) and third (2010) season finales. His character, referred to only as ""Management,"" is a senior intelligence agency official who is the apparent main mover of the conspiracy which blacklisted Michael Westen.[25][26]  Mahoney joined the cast of In Treatment for the series' second season (2009) as a frenetic CEO who is overwhelmed by his personal and professional responsibilities and experiences chronic physical anxiety attacks. In 2010, he made a guest appearance on $#@! My Dad Says as homophobic retired naval officer Lt. Commander Wally Durham. Despite the numerous successes throughout his career, Mahoney has maintained that his early work in Lyle Kessler's play Orphans has ""affected people more than any other play I've ever done. I still get mail from it, I still get people stopping me on the street, and it's 20 years later.""[27]  Beginning in April 2011, Mahoney began rehearsing The Outgoing Tide, a new play by Bruce Graham at Northlight Theatre in Skokie, Illinois (suburban Chicago). The play also stars fellow Chicago actors Rondi Reed and Thom Cox. In 2011, he had two guest appearances on Hot in Cleveland as Roy, a waiter and a love interest for Betty White's character Elka.[28] This reunited him with his Frasier co-star Jane Leeves, as well as Wendie Malick whose character he eventually married in Frasier and his co-star in the movie The American President. Mahoney was a featured ensemble cast member in The Birthday Party, playing in Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre from January 24 to April 28, 2013.[29] Mahoney portrayed his last role in the play The Rembrandt, from September to November 2017.[30]  Personal life [ edit ]  Along with David Hyde Pierce, Mahoney was godfather to Frasier co-star Jane Leeves' son Finn.[31] Mahoney rarely spoke publicly about his private life,[7] but in a 2002 article he revealed he had been in several relationships, although he had never married, citing his parents' unhappy marriage as something he feared he would repeat.[8] He suffered from colon cancer in the mid-1980s and felt unable to have sex following a colostomy.[32] His Catholic faith was at the center of his life and work.[33][34]  Mahoney lived in Oak Park, Illinois.[8]  Death [ edit ]  Mahoney died in a Chicago hospice on February 4, 2018, of complications from throat cancer, originally diagnosed in 2014. He was 77 years old. According to his friend Anna Shapiro: ""He was fragile and he was supposed to be having a routine procedure. But having just beat Stage 3 throat cancer, I think he was just too weak… By the time he did The Rembrandt he was clean of cancer... But other health issues came up and he was just too fragile.""[35][36][37][38][39]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]",0
"Longtime Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek told fans on Thursday he’s recovering from brain surgery to correct a “slight medical problem” he suffered during the show’s holiday break: a subdural hematoma, or blood clots on the brain.  The 77-year-old host, who had a mild heart attack in 2012 and a knee replacement in 2015, thanked and reassured the show’s fanbase in a video posted to its YouTube page. “The prognosis is excellent, and I expect to be back in the studio taping more Jeopardy! programs very, very soon,” he said. “And I want to thank all of you for your concern.”  Here’s what you should know about Trebek’s diagnosis.  What is a subdural hematoma?  A subdural hematoma is a pooling of blood between the dura — the sturdy, protective layer of tissue encasing the brain — and the surface of the brain itself, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Subdural hematomas happen when blood vessels, often veins, burst in this area, forming a collection of blood that presses on the brain, according to the Mayo Clinic.  What causes a subdural hematoma?  While this type of brain bleed is occasionally random, a subdural hematoma most often follows a traumatic head injury, such as a fall, collision or accident, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Trebek told fans that his was the result of a fall that occurred a couple months ago.  What are the symptoms of a subdural hematoma?  Subdural hematoma symptoms typically include headache, vomiting, drowsiness and eventual loss of consciousness, dizziness, confusion, differing pupil size and slurred speech, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms may appear immediately, but in some cases, they can take weeks or even months to manifest.  How serious is a subdural hematoma?  They can be fatal, but a person’s prognosis depends on multiple factors, from the size and severity of the bleed to how quickly treatment is sought, the U.S. National Library of Medicine says. Some subdural hematomas are reversed by drilling a hole in the skull to drain blood and relieve pressure on the brain, while others require more invasive brain surgery. Trebek did not comment on the severity of his case or his treatment plan.  Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com.",0
"Washington (CNN) It wouldn't be an awards show without some political moments.  This year, we kept track of every political jab and line made at the 90th annual Academy Awards show . Check out the list below:  On the carpet  Fashion as a political statement  Tonight, actors and allies will #WearOrange pins and ribbons on the #Oscars red carpet to bring awareness to gun violence prevention in the wake of the Parkland school shooting. https://t.co/7BxtM6bTKD  As expected, many attendees sported the signature ""Time's up"" black and white pin.  Another popular pin spotted on the carpet? #WearOrange pins and ribbons from gun control group Everytown. They were worn in an effort to raise awareness about gun safety.  Puerto Rico still on the mind  During an interview with Michael Strahan, ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda encouraged viewers to visit Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricane.  Lin-Manuel Miranda encourages viewers to visit Puerto Rico after devastating hurricane: ""Keep Puerto Rico in the conversation...keep Puerto Rico in your hearts."" https://t.co/exBwXimwm1 #Oscars pic.twitter.com/kBxhqLo1UG — ABC News (@ABC) March 5, 2018  ""Keep Puerto Rico in the conversation. I know there's no shortage of things in the news, but keep Puerto Rico in your hearts,"" Miranda said.  He added that tourism is ""the lifeblood"" of Puerto Rico, and urged people to ""spend money there.""  On average, 87% of the island has power, but sources told CNN that about 150,000 US citizens on the island still don't have electricity. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has repeatedly expressed frustration at the slow pace of recovery and help. He has questioned the US Army Corps of Engineers' response on the island compared with other states dealing with disaster.  Miranda has been an outspoken critic of the government response to Puerto Rico's needs, and had strong words for President Donald Trump following his criticism of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz last year.  In October of 2017, Miranda released a song -- with help from 22 other artists -- to raise money for hurricane relief in Puerto Rico.  Political activists attended Hollywood's biggest night  Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards attended the Oscars with Patrisse Cullors-Brignac, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, and Bryan Stevenson, Equal Justice Initiative director. The three posed on the red carpet ahead of the show.  Richards, who announced in January that she is leaving the role later this year, posted a photo on Instagram. ""So the Oscars are cool but being with Bryan and Patrisse is 100,"" she wrote.  Jimmy Kimmel's opener  Kimmel returned to the helm as host on Sunday. He of course had a few envelope jokes, referencing the envelope mix-up last year that initially (and mistakenly) resulted in ""La La Land"" being named the best picture winner over ""Moonlight"" at the 89th Academy Awards.  But there were also a few political zingers.  Wakanda  Before kicking off his monologue, Kimmel did an old Hollywood-like voiceover to black and white footage from this year's red carpet.  ""There's Chadwick Boseman,"" he said at one point, as footage of the ""Black Panther"" actor played. ""The king of Wakanda! Imagine that! A country with a black leader. Wouldn't that be swell?""  Fox News  Later, while talking about Harvey Weinstein -- and the subsequent powerful #MeToo movement and Time's Up initiative -- Kimmel joked about the awards show statuette: Oscar.  ""Oscar is 89 years old this year, which probably means he's at home watching Fox News,"" Kimmel said, a jab at the network news channel's older, more conservative viewers.  He went on to clarify that ""Oscar is a very respected man in Hollywood. Just look at him: He keeps his hands where he can see them, no penis.""  ""Get Out"" and Trump  The first Trump joke came about 10 minutes into Kimmel's monologue.  ""None other than President Trump called 'Get Out' the best 3/4 of a movie so far this year,"" Kimmel said when addressing the mastermind behind the film, Jordan Peele  The horror film, which has received praise for its performances and thought-provoking take on race in America, received four Academy Award nominations, including one for best picture.  Calling out Vice President Mike Pence  Kimmel made a joke about Pence while talking about best actor nominee Timothee Chalamet, nominated for the film ""Call Me By Your Name,"" a gay love story.  ""We don't make films like 'Call Me By Your Name for money,"" Kimmel said, while talking about how the film was critically acclaimed but didn't do as well at the box office. ""We make them to upset Mike Pence.""  Kimmel during the show  Hope Hicks' departure  Kimmel made another White House joke while introducing director Greta Gerwig and actress Laura Dern before they presented the best documentary feature category.  ""If the last two years have taught us anything, it's that reality can be ... depressing,"" he said. ""But tonight's nominated documentaries show us that where there is darkness, there is also hope. Except at the White House. Hope quit on Wednesday.""  Hicks, the former White House communications director and one of Trump's longest-serving and closest aides, resigned last week.  Putin burn  The Russian Olympics doping documentary ""Icarus"" took home best documentary feature on Sunday.  The film, from filmmaker Bryan Fogel, delves into the controversy around performance-enhancing drugs in sports. It follows the eccentric Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the whistleblower who exposed what a leading report called a doping ""cover-up that operated on an unprecedented scale"" in Russia (read CNN's story on this here ).  Russia was banned from the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics following state-sponsored doping, leading up to and including the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.  Kimmel's response to ""Icarus"" winning? ""At least we know Putin didn't rig this competition.""  Speaking of 'Icarus' ...  During his acceptance speech, Fogel got a little political himself.  ""We dedicate this award to Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, our fearless whistleblower, who now lives in great danger,"" he said. ""We hope 'Icarus' is a wake-up call -- yes, about Russia, but more importantly, about telling the truth.""

Join us as we say #HereWeArehttps://t.co/bVXGJ1NibP — Twitter (@Twitter) March 5, 2018  Twitter premiered an ad called #HereWeAre during the Oscars with a message empowering women leaders. While the ad was not explicitly political, it included an implicit reference to immigration rhetoric.  ""If this poem is the only thing that survives me, tell them this is how it happened: Tell them I built me a throne. Tell them when we discovered life on another planet it was a woman and she built a bridge -- not a border. I heard that this is how you make history. This is how you create a new world.""  A shout out to the Dreamers  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has enabled hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants -- sometimes called Dreamers -- who were brought to the United States as children to come out from the shadows and openly attend school and get work permits and driver's licenses without fear of being deported.  Trump announced the end of the DACA program last fall, giving Congress a March 5 deadline to come up with an alternate solution. But that deadline became moot after two separate district courts ruled that the administration must keep accepting renewal applications for the program, effectively putting the termination on hold.  ""Like everyone in this room and everyone watching at home we are dreamers,"" said Nyong'o, who is from Kenya. ""We grew up dreaming of one day working in the movies. Dreams are the foundation of Hollywood, and dreams are the foundation of America.""  Nanjiani added: ""To all the Dreamers out there, we stand with you.""

""Tell the NRA they ain't God's way and tell the people of Parkland we say àse (a West African philosophy about creating change).,"" the Oscar-winning rapper said, referring to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 people dead last month.  The NRA responded to Common on Twitter. The organization wrote : ""@common @TheAcademy: This is what the #NRA and its members stand for. #Oscars.""

""The changes we are witnessing are being driven by the powerful sound of new voices, different voices, of our voices, who are joining together in a mighty chorus that is finally saying Time's Up,"" Judd said.  The video featured interviews with Nanjiani, Ava Duvernay, Greta Gerwig, Barry Jenkins and others.

"Tennessee middle-schooler Keaton Jones is opening up about life after his anti-bullying video, revealing that he hasn’t returned to school since the footage spread across the Internet.  The 11-year-old and his mother, Kimberly Jones, appeared on British talk show This Morning on Thursday where they said they aren’t sure when Keaton will return to Horace Maynard Middle School in Maynardville, Tennessee.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I actually haven’t been to school,” he said. He added of his bullies: “Why do you bully? What’s the point of it? It makes me feel awful.”  This Morning/ITV  Kimberly said that Keaton expressed that he didn’t want to return even to the middle school even “when the whole world wanted to come and eat lunch with him.”  “I’ve struggled anyway especially being this close to Christmas break, but after seeing how big it got, I mean it just seems like maybe we should let it die down a little bit before we made any decisions so that we could kind of have a reality of what life is gonna be like,” she continued.  Love What Matters/Facebook  Keaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he’s endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, “make fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.”  However, Keaton’s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton’s story for financial gain.  “I’ve said over and over, I’m an adult, I know who I am. I’m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children…” Kimberly said during the morning show. “That’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody.”  She added that the backlash has “brought the bullies out.” Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.  As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton’s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton’s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet.  Henry Winkler Offers a Powerful Message Following Tennessee Student’s Viral Anti-Bullying Video  “You all can go look back at every tweet from every father’s & mother’s day to see that all we have is our mom,” Lakyn wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday. “We have no contact with our dads. BECAUSE of their actions. That’s why all the articles say ‘estranged’ because we don’t talk to them. Leave us alone.”  Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.  “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”",0
"Former NBC host Billy Bush has lashed out at President Donald Trump for trying to cast doubt on the authenticity of the now infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, which captured Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women.  “Of course he said it,” Bush wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday titled, “Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That”.  Bush said he felt compelled to speak out after the president reportedly began telling aides and fellow politicians that the tape was fabricated.  “President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history,” Bush said.  “This has hit a raw nerve in me.”  In the 2005 recording, which resurfaced during the final moments of last year’s presidential campaign when it was published by the Washington Post, Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent.  Trump, on a hot mic, tells the Access Hollywood anchor about unsuccessfully trying to have sex with a married woman and how “you can do anything” to women “when you’re a star.” He said he was able to “grab them by the pussy.”  After the recording’s release, Trump, then a presidential candidate, issued an apology and dismissed the talk as “locker room” banter.  More recently, Trump has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually his, according to the New York Times.  Bush, who was fired by NBC after the tape’s release, confirms the voice is undoubtedly Trump’s, but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than “hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator”.  “There were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act,” Bush wrote.  His perspective changed when he read an account of 20 women who accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior.  One woman’s story, about being pushed against a wall and groped, made “the whole ‘better use some Tic Tacs’ and ‘just start kissing them’ routine real,” Bush said. “I believe her”.",0

Who could forget Prince William's goddaughter, Grace Van Cutsem, stealing the limelight during his first kiss with the Duchess of Cambridge after their wedding?  The latest kid to totally upstage a monarch is 11-year-old Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway.  As the Norwegian royal family and nobility gathered on the balcony of an Oslo palace to celebrate the King Harald and Queen Sonja's 80th birthdays, well-wishers waved and cheered.  (Image: Getty)  But to the left of the monarchs in clips of the celebrations, a cheeky young prince was doing his best to keep fellow youngsters entertained - and totally stole the show.  Prince Sverre, who is third in line to the Norwegian throne - just like Britain's Prince George - could be seen mumbling and pulling faces, drawing eye rolls from his cousins and sister.  The cheeky chap, son of Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, then decided to kick it up a notch and performed the popular 'dab' move (you can watch the video to see exactly how this one works) prompting giggles from the children around him.  It was such a 'blink and you'll miss it' moment, he almost got away with it, but unfortunately for him, cameras captured everything.  His antics prompted a sharp nudge from fed-up cousin Leah Isadora Behn, aged 12, who looks as though she was keeping him in check.  The clip prompted comparisons to Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding in 2011, when flower girl Grace Van Cutsem upstaged the couple's first kiss by covering her ears due to the noise of the crowd.

Prince George and Princess Charlotte are set to attend as page boy and flower girl and it remains to be seen whether they will steal the limelight from their aunt.",0

"There’s reportedly trouble in paradise at the Kardashian West house. Kim’s allegedly ready to divorce Kanye! What happened?  This is so sad! Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed! If they’re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn’t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they’re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a “mid-nuptial agreement” to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye’s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim’s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!  Don’t think she’s happy about this, though. “This decision is agony for her,” the source said. “She still loves Kanye, but their marriage may be over!” This is so sad, considering what we just learned from a source. Kim and Kanye were happily including daughter North West in the conversation about her new little sister, the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. If they’re truly having problems, then at least they’re putting on a united front for their little ones.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim’s rep for comment.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Kim and Kanye are really divorcing? Let us know!",1
"Home for the spring holidays! The night before Easter, admirably friendly exes Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon reunited to celebrate with their 5-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan. The “Emotions” singer took to Instagram to post a sweet snap of the family decorating Easter eggs . In the adorable photo, the family of four sits around a kitchen table dying eggs in all sorts of pastel colors for Easter. “Easter with #demkids,” she shared with her followers. “#moments #rocandroe #easter #family @nickcannon.”  Looks like the pop-megastar is trying to change the nickname of her growing twins to #demkids, who have been referred to by fans as #dembabies since their birth in 2012. The duo were married in April of 2008 but the “Honey” singer filed for divorce December of 2014.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SZfWl8gS/  Carey and Cannon’s Easter celebration just a week after the “Glitter” actress announced she had split from backup dancer, Bryan Tanka after a year of dating. According to TMZ, Tanaka felt “disrespected” when Carey and Cannon, 36, attended the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards with their children on March 11. Tanaka would reportedly “lash back” at Carey and her friendship with Cannon by flirting with other women. Per TMZ, the pair have not seen or spoken to each other since they traveled to Cabo together at the end of March.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SjBrF1Et/  The “Butterfly” singer also suffered heartbreak in October of 2016 after confirming her breakup with Australian billionaire, James Packer. The former couple had been together ever since being introduced to each other by their mutual friend, producer Brett Ratner, at the premiere of 2014’s Hercules.  Cannon has also had some big life changes this year after becoming a father for the third time over announcing the birth of his son Golden “Sagon” Cannon on his Instagram Page on Tuesday, Feb. 21. The Wild ’N’ Out star captioned the photo. “Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy cometh in the morning! No matter how hard the world may hit you, God always reminds us of our purpose! #TrueHappiness, welcome to Earth Son!” added Cannon, 36.

"With only a few days left in the year, Khloé Kardashian, aka the clap back queen of 2018, is still working hard to defend her title.  Khloé decided a post a picture of her and her mom last night with a sweet caption about how much she appreciates Kris, saying ""♚ You are a Queen who has raised multiple mini Queens still trying to be as strong and fabulous as you are! I will love you more and more everyday Until the end of time ♚.""  But of course, the internet being the internet, Khloé's followers decided to leave some pretty unnecessary/rude comments rather than bask in the mother/daughter love, and Khloé was NOT having it.  First, a user commented, ""would you keep IG if all photo editing apps were gone forever??? Lol."" Khloé responded with, ""would you? Sometimes I wonder why people comment if it adds no value to ones life? Maybe I'm just different...but I don't care to be negative or passive aggressive. Our world is toxic enough as it is. It's sad people care to criticize something like an editing app. Let it go babes. Say something nice or just let it go. How does this serve you love?""  Instagram  And because that wasn't enough, another user decided to take it on themselves to remind Khloé that she also had a brother, as if that's something that she would forget. The person commented, ""It's a shame Rob Kardashian is a member of the family and he is NEVER mentioned!!!""  Khloé's reply? ""my bother is my entire world! He is definitely a king 👑 it is a shame that can respect us for respecting his privacy. You should not comment if you truly aren't informed about our family.""  Instagram  How many times will this happen before trolls learn that you do NOT want to come for Khloé—she will 100% slam you for it.",1
"Tom Cruise’s ex-wife Katie Holmes is allegedly spending millions of dollars to keep her rumored romance with Jamie Foxx a secret. According to the latest speculation into Katie and Jamie’s personal lives, the alleged couple is spending way too much money during this courtship.  After Katie Holmes decided to end her troubled marriage with the Top Gun star, rumors started to surface that she is having an on-and-off relationship with former Dawson’s Creek’s co-star Joshua Jackson. After that, her name was linked with How I Met Your Mother star Jason Segel. If that was not it, there were several rumors that indicated her inclination toward her The Kennedys: After Camelot co-star Matthew Perry. From the past three years, there are rumors that the 38-year-old Katie is having a secret and serious relationship with 49-year-old Jamie Foxx.  According to an insider who spoke to Life & Style, the alleged couple has put a lot of work into keeping their romance out of the media. Their secret romance is all about secret trips, sworn secrecy, and disguises. Not only this, they have even asked their close friends not to reveal their relationship among the paparazzi.  “Their relationship is warm and passionate and very, very private. Only their closest friends are privy to their love affair,” the source told the outlet.  As previously reported by different media outlets, the real reason behind all the secrecy is Tom Cruise. According to them, Tom will feel betrayed that his old friend and Collateral co-star got involved with his ex-wife.  “Katie would go to Jamie’s house and lie down in the back of a car so she wouldn’t be seen on the way in. Jamie and Katie also felt safe on yachts because no one would see them out on the water. [The secrecy] added passion.”  It was previously reported by the Inquisitr that when Jamie was asked by a reporter at LAX about his alleged relationship with Katie Holmes, the Django Unchained movie star responded by coyly, calling the rumors of his dating life nothing but “fake news.” Similar to this, both Katie and Jamie were photographed together at a romantic restaurant in New York City in April. In the leaked pictures, they both tried to go incognito by sporting sunglasses and hats.  The insider went on to suggest that after having a tough time dealing with the Church of Scientology and her troubled marriage to Tom Cruise, the Batman Begins actress wanted her personal life to go as smoothly as possible. The recent attempts by Jamie are making her extremely anxious, but given the fact that she is deeply in love with him, she is willing to spend $100,000 per year just to have a background check on everyone they hang out with.  “This is not at all how Katie saw her life going. But she will take this over nothing. Katie’s friends are telling her that if he isn’t willing to step up and be there for her as a true partner, it’s time for her to move on,” the insider said. “But she really loves him and can’t seem to let go.”  A lot has been said and published about the personal lives of Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx. There were once rumors that Katie was pregnant, then there were rumors indicating that due to her contractual marriage with Tom Cruise, she is not allowed to publicly date until 2017. Now there are these rumors suggesting that the alleged couple is spending millions just to maintain privacy from the media and Tom Cruise.  Fans of both Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx should remember that neither the stars nor their representatives have confirmed the news about their relationship. So, it is safe to say that Tom Cruise’s ex-wife is currently not involved with the Horrible Bosses star.  [Featured Image by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images and Theo Wargo/Getty Images]",1
"Wake up, Mr. West.  As an encore to last year’s epic rant, Kanye West made the most of his allotted four minutes — stretching it to almost seven — during Sunday’s Video Music Awards, when he graced the stage inside Madison Square Garden to praise his one and only: himself.  “I am Kanye West. And that feels really great to say that especially this year,” West began. “I came here to present my new video, but before I do that imma talk.”  “Now later in the night, ‘Famous’ [West’s music video] might lose to Beyoncé. But I can’t be mad, I’m always wishing for Beyoncé to win,” he alluded to the VMAs moment from years past, in which he swiped the mic from Taylor Swift in the great stage crash of 2009.  West, 39, referenced his ongoing feud with Swift, 26, saying, “We came over in the same boat, now we’re all in the same bed. Well, maybe different boats, but … If you think about last week, there was 22 people murdered in Chicago. You know, like, people come up to me like, ‘Man, that’s right… Take Taylor? I love all y’all. That’s why I called her!”  He continued to explain the music video, in which nude likeliness of Donald Trump, Anna Wintour, Amber Rose and other famous personalities are sprawled out in bed, “But for people to understand just how blessed we are, it was an expression of our now, our fame right now. Us inside of the TV — you just know.”  “The audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump. I mean, I put Ray J in it bro!” he exclaimed.  After giving wife Kim Kardashian‘s ex a shout out, he did the same for his former flame, Amber Rose.  “I see you Amber,” he said to a smiling Rose in the audience. “My wife is a G — not a lot of people’s wives would let them say that.”  West continued to name drop, comparing himself once again to Steve Jobs and Walt Disney.  “I sit down and talk to older like rich people. A.k.a. white. And they tell me don’t compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don’t compare yourself to Walt Disney … They told me there are three keys to keeping people improving. Taking away their resources and role models. My role models are artists, merchants, Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West,” he explained.  West then signed off with a few final words of his wisdom about the future of the industry.  “Tonight we’re here to have fun. I’m standing in front of my idol Puff Daddy,” West said. “I’m standing in front of my wife Kim Kardashian West. I’m standing in front of the future, Chance the rapper. 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith. We are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders. I’m gonna play y’all a piece of my art and I hope y’all have a good time.”",0

"Corinne Olympios says medication, the booze and the media were key players in June's production-stopping ""Bachelor in Paradise"" scandal and its aftermath.  Calling the situation ""just really unfortunate,"" she said Tuesday on ""Good Morning America"" that she doesn't remember anything that happened. Seeing video of what transpired on the first day of production on the looking-for-love reality show was ""like watching not-me,"" she said. ""I'm watching someone else.""  On that day, Olympios and fellow cast member DeMario Jackson allegedly wound up in the pool or hot tub together in a situation that a producer thought went too far. Allegations of ""misconduct"" were made, and production shut down the next day for an investigation that ultimately determined nothing untoward had happened.  The show, sans Corinne and DeMario, premiered its fourth season Aug. 14, a week later than originally planned.  ""I did drink, too much, I definitely understand that,"" Olympios said. ""But I was also on a medication that severely blacks you out and impairs your judgment and messes with your balance, that I didn't know you were not supposed to not drink on, and so it really just caused a horrible, horrible blackout. It was like I went under like anesthesia and then just like woke up.""",0
"Kim Kardashian broke the Internet. Beyoncé shut it down. But Will Smith brought it back to life the day he joined Instagram.  While the social media platform launched back in 2018, it wasn't until one fateful day in December 2017 that the Fresh Prince decided to post his first IG picture. It's been on ever since.  The charismatic super star let fans into his childhood when he shared a baby photo that required no filters. Approximately seven IG posts later, he had everyone hooked, especially when he showed just how proud he is to be a father by uploading a split image of Jaden and himself in similar poses at two different events.  Will then reminded his fans and binge watchers everywhere to keep watching Netflix (before the whole Mo’Nique boycott went down).  But it isn't just his wit and family pics that has everyone following Smith—it's his life advice. From inspirational posts laced with comedic timing, to his musings on what it takes to make a marriage last, Smith's insight never comes off as preachy, which people obviously relate to. Since joining in December, his followers have swelled to 8.9 million.  Bottom line? There are many reasons to love Will Smith's Instagram— nine major keys to be exact.  He's Motivational  No matter the subject, Will always finds new ways of encouraging people to cut the dead weight out of their lives, so that they can shine brighter.  He Inspires New Perspectives  Smith's response to this young artist's animation proves he’s not afraid to look at himself through someone else’s eyes.  His Co-Signs Are Everything  He waited approximately 2,700 days to launch his IG account but he used Ellen Degeneres' talk show as the plug when he did. Enough said.  He Defines Cultural Ideas  The now 49-year-old actor started off as a big-eared kid from Philly looking to make it. Somewhere along the way he transformed into an inebriated super hero, but not before experiencing life as one of the world's soul survivors. Now he's a full blown family man who's still doing backflips on a big screen while banking millions. He personifies the phrase, ""Black don't crack!""  He Always Remembers His Roots  Smith may be worth around $260 million, but he never forgets where he came from.  He Has the Best Friends  Understandably, Will Smith has a lot of high-ranking friends in a lot of high-ranking places. But sometimes, it’s not about the money or the fame. Sometimes it’s just having a lot of (high-ranking) celebrity friends who care just as much about the culture as you do.  He Shows His Family A Lot Of Love  Through all his stardom, Will has always seems to put family first. With his family by his side, he shows the new generation it’s still cool to be a family man.  He's All About Self-Empowerment  He announced he was starting a vlog to show people the things they can do when they’re not sleeping— and what he’s doing when we are.  He's A Genius  Will showed us he can rap and act, but when he jumped on camera and conquered a Rubik’s Cube, we realized he can do anything – even master the philosophies of a colorful square puzzle.",0

"Nick Cannon And Mariah Carey Bicker Back-And-Forth At Kids’ Choice Awards  The other day we reported on the “family fun day” that Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon had with “dem babies” and the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards.  Welp, according to OKMagazine, looks can be very deceiving…  Despite the smiles and laughs that the co-parents flashed on the red carpet, there was an ugly dispute taking place underneath.  But, a source told OK! exclusively that Mariah and Nick, who put on a united front around the cameras, were not as happy once inside. The two “apparently had an argument of some sort while they were sitting in their seats.” And while it’s unclear what they disagreed on, it didn’t seem to blow over, as “she got up and left and Nick went over to her manager and grabbed his kids,” continued the insider. And Mariah didn’t return to her seat!  What the hell could Nick and Mariah POSSIBLY be beefing about, in front of their children, at the Kids’ Choice Awards???

""It’s nothing more precious than this little, innocent baby that’s just helpless and they just look at you like you’re the world, you know? Once they get older, they get a little more independent. It’s just an amazing feeling, I’m really looking forward to it.”  The happy pregnancy news comes after Monique shared the heartbreaking news that she suffered a miscarriage last year.  “It’s like, now, I’m finally able to really enjoy the pregnancy because, you know, there was so much fear in the beginning … now that we’re past that, we’re out of the first trimester, I finally just had to sit back and go, you know what? I’m going to enjoy every bit of this pregnancy and I’m not going to live in fear,” she said. “[We want to] let people know that you’re not the only one. You don’t have to feel alone. Everyone goes through these things.”  Watch the video below for more Real Housewives baby news:  RELATED CONTENT:  Why ‘RHOP’ Reunion Left Monique Samuels ‘Disappointed’ (Exclusive)  Why 'Real Housewives' Star Monique Samuels Is Happy to Share Her Marriage and Pregnancy Struggles (Exclusive)  EXCLUSIVE: Monique Samuels Kicks 'Real Housewives of Potomac' Co-Star Gizelle Bryant Out of Her House -- Watch  Related Gallery",0
Us Weekly rounded up some of Hollywood’s hottest celebrity couples who prove that love isn’t dead — see who made the cut!  Celebrity Couples With The Most Romantic Love Stories!,1
"The pair gleefully rocked up to early press interviews hand-in-hand and waxed lyrical about one another.  An HBO source confirmed that during filming the duo were 'inseparable on the set.'  'The two of them were always joking around and having fun together.'  However over time this friendship has eroded. Once the show went to air in February, the pair’s relationship started to become competitive.  A source told LIFE & STYLE that things turned from that point onwards.  'The success of Big Little Lies has gone to both of their heads and there’s now a power struggle between the two stars,' the source revealed.  'Behind closed doors, their egos are clashing and they bicker over the smallest thing.'  The public were given a glimpse into the ongoing feud at the Emmy Awards in September when Big Little Lies won the Outstanding Limited Series category.  On stage, Reese grabbed the statue and refused to let it go – even when Nicole tried to have a turn holding it.  Tensions were further fuelled after Nicole beat out Reese for the Emmy award in the category of Best Actress In A Limited Series.  'There seemed to be some tension between Nicole and Reese at the Emmys afterparty,’ says the Insider.  'There were some icy stares back and forth, kind of checking who was getting most of the attention, which was clearly Nicole.'  For now the stars are continuing to play nice for the cameras when fulfilling their publicity duties. But the insider says this is all just for show.  'The bottom line is that Nicole and Reese really don’t like each other.'",1
"Fans have congratulated the winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race season 10 following a dramatic show finale.  Going into Thursday’s crunch episode, four contestants – Asia O’Hara, Kameron Michaels, Eureka and Aquaria – were vying for the crown.  Aquaria was eventually named the winner – but not before a tense lip-sync competition resulted in an embarrassing end for one of the queens.  In the first challenge, the contestants were divided into pairs and made to battle each other in singles.  Asia was faced with Kameron. Asia’s plan was to have live butterflies fly out – but they failed to release and the trick failed.  Kameron was named the winner and went on to face both Eureka and Aquaria in the final, meaning a three-way battle for the crown, a series first.  The final performance was to Big Bang by Jessie J, Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande, with Aquaria walking away the victor.

"The territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East over the past week have prompted a fresh look at what the U.S. can do to stop the militant group. But lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success.""We need to have a more robust strategy. We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,"" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy. And anyone that says that there is, I'd like to hear what it is because it certainly isn't apparent now and right now.""He said that there should be a few thousand more American troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission.But California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences.During the Iraq War, Schiff said, ""We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military.""Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,"" he said.He warned that sending in a lot of American troops could ""aggravate"" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight.McCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded.""George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,"" he said.For now, Schiff said there is an ""ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS."" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.""I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,"" he said.",0
"From Alexa Chung to January Jones and Chrissy Teigen, the sheet mask continues to adorn the faces of our favourite celebrities all over Instagram, and for good reason too. The biggest trend to come out of Korea, these skincare saviours give an instant hit of hydration, with specially formulated serums that quickly penetrate skin for maximum effect. Korean beauty boutiques are lined with hundreds of packets of different masks and women pick and mix to create a library of sheet masks to match every skin type and concern.  Happily, the Award Winning* Charcoal & Willow Bark Tissue Face Mask from Boots Ingredients is somewhat closer to home – it’s in November’s GLOSSYBOX in fact! A no mess sheet mask that helps purify, cleanse and revitalise skin with seriously soothing ingredients – and works in just 15 minutes! If you aren’t already a subscriber order your box here and get your hands on this (as well as four more full-size goodies).  Taking our cue from our Korean counterparts, here’s how to use your masks like a pro…  1. Take the mask out of the packet, unfold it and place it over your face, positioning it so you can see through the holes for your eyes. You can apply it directly to cleansed skin or you can apply a moisturising serum first to boost hydration. Extra points if you dunk the packet into warm water for one minute to allow it to heat up beforehand.  2. Firmly press the mask over the skin to encourage the product to penetrate effectively and ensure that it sits against skin especially around that awkward nose area.  3. After 15 minutes remove the mask, taking time to massage any residue that remains into the skin. You can also sweep the sheet over your throat and decollate (much like you would a serum-saturated cotton wool ball) to get the most of any serum that remains.",0

"From left: Khloe Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner. (Brian Bowen Smith/E!)  Love ’em or hate ’em, the Kardashians are a cultural force that built an empire out of an E! reality TV series. And as the family marked its 10th anniversary on TV, in perhaps a maddening publicity savvy move, gossip sites began running stories that the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner brood was pregnant.  Even as the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” special aired, a chyron scrolled by on the bottom of the screen reading: “KYLIE JENNER IS PREGNANT: REPORTS.”  That story line alone would have been enough to heighten the world’s attention on the family: Pregnancy is a hot commodity for celebrity news coverage; Kylie is just 20; and she’s only been linked to her current boyfriend for about six months. But the scrutiny amped up considerably as other pregnancy-related stories hit the tabloids.  [Why you still can’t stop watching ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians,’ 10 years later]  None of the famous sisters has actually confirmed, on the record, that they are expecting. Still, the stories are breaking and it can be hard to get a handle on them all. Here’s a rundown:  Kim Kardashian surrogacy rumors (summer 2017)  This was the first peg in the pregnancy saga. TMZ ran a story in June that Kim and husband Kanye West had hired a surrogate to carry their third child, including some juicy details as to how much they were paying.  Then in July, Us Weekly ran a story that the surrogate was three months pregnant and expecting in November.  But, in an August Hollywood Reporter cover story, the outlet wrote that “on the possibility of a third child, reportedly via a surrogate,” Kim said: “I hope so. There have been a lot of things said and Kanye and I have not confirmed anything. We’re definitely trying. We are hoping so.”  On Thursday, Kim tweeted the trailer for the upcoming season of her family’s reality show — in which she confirms that she’s having another baby. “What happens every time I say, ‘Guess what?’ ” Kim says to Khloé over FaceTime. “You’re pregnant — or the person’s pregnant,” her sister responds.  “We’re having a baby!” Kim says.  Season 14 is gonna be wild. Tune in this Sunday!!! #KUWTK pic.twitter.com/rnpIdGiNyK — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) September 28, 2017  That Kim may have hired a surrogate at all wasn’t surprising to begin with; she’s been public about her prior difficult pregnancies with North and Saint, and the life-threatening conditions she endured while carrying them.    Kim Kardashian and Kanye West arrive at the 2015 CFDA Fashion Awards. (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)  Kylie Jenner, allegedly pregnant (starting Sept. 22)  TMZ dropped the bombshell Friday: The youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner brood is pregnant, and the father is Travis Scott. The two have been romantically linked since April.  But Kylie herself has not confirmed the reports. Neither have her family members — sort of.  Hollywood Life cited an individual close to Caitlyn Jenner as saying she was “shocked and disappointed” to hear her 20-year-old daughter was pregnant. Then, in a non-denial denial, the British tabloid the Sun wrote: “Speaking about claims Caitlyn wasn’t personally told her youngest daughter is pregnant, the Olympian’s rep confirmed she was told and said: ‘All I can tell you is that it was some time ago.’”  What about Kris Jenner? During “Live With Kelly and Ryan,” Ryan Seacrest read a text from the momager herself. “Kris says Kylie’s not confirming anything,” Seacrest said on air. “That’s the news from the family this morning. Kylie is not confirming anything.”  Kris also talked to the Cut at the Bottega Veneta fashion show, and the matriarch offered frustratingly few details:  Did you know the news was going to break about Kylie? I just woke up this morning. She’s not confirmed anything. I think it’s kind of wild that everyone is just assuming that that’s just happening. So, you didn’t know that rumor was going to happen? Something happens every single day. You never know what is going to break at any moment.  Even Kylie herself posted throwback, flat-tummy photos on social media — along with a more recent one offering an inconclusive peek at her stomach.  Then came the gossip about how the rest of the family was taking it.  “Kim Kardashian’s first reaction to Kylie’s pregnancy news was reportedly not great,” read a Harpers Bazaar headline. Kim tweeted it adding:  This sounds like a very fake story... https://t.co/ZIxCltgK6d — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) September 26, 2017  People cited an individual saying it was the family’s “nightmare” that Kylie would get pregnant with her ex-boyfriend Tyga. (And in case you need a catch-up: Tyga, who dated Kylie Jenner for years, shares a child with Blac Chyna, who then went on to have a daughter with Rob Kardashian. The Blac Chyna-Rob Kardashian romance was short-lived, filmed on a sad reality TV show; it led to a public meltdown and a restraining order.)  [Rob Kardashian, the most tragic figure of America’s most fame-seeking family]  Khloe Kardashian, also apparently expecting! (Sept. 26)  On Tuesday, TMZ, E! and BuzzFeed all cited anonymous individuals in reporting that the 33-year-old younger sister of Kourtney and Kim is pregnant, and her boyfriend, Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson, is the father.  According to TMZ, Khloe is three months along. Let the clue hunting begin.  Khloe said she was drinking champagne during the family’s 10th anniversary special, which was pretaped. She also talked about Thompson: “Yeah, it’s a serious relationship.”  She also said she’s always in Cleveland whenever he is. Days before the anonymously cited reports about her pregnancy broke, she posted this bare-belly photo, prompting a lot of curious fans to wonder if she was actually three months along. (Yes, we’ve approached Zapruder film-level analysis here.)  The June season finale of KUWTK included a story line in which Khloe explored whether to serve as a surrogate for Kim. A fertility specialist delivered not-great news to Khloe, and suggested she stop taking birth control pills.  Khloe did just that, and when she received an update that her chances of conceiving had improved, she called Thompson.  “I am so relieved to know that I am able to get pregnant,” Khloe said on air. “Now I have so many other things to think about. Do I wanna have my own baby now? I don’t know. I’m at a crossroads.”  She continued: “Tristan and I definitely talk about starting a family. He wants to have about five or six kids with me and that’s lovely. We could start at one and we could grow from there. But now knowing I’m not on birth control is scary. It’s like a really big step.”  The conspiracy theories (from the beginning until forever)  The convergence of these three story lines has led to this:  “All the Evidence That Khloe Kardashian Is Kim’s Surrogate,” reads a Marie Claire headline.  “Is Pregnant Kylie Jenner Secretly Kim Kardashian’s Surrogate? An Investigation,” proclaims the Daily Beast.  What if the twist in the alleged Kylie Jenner pregnancy is that she's Kim and Kanye's surrogate for baby no. 3? pic.twitter.com/RI8CG18Qvz — David Onda (@David_Onda) September 22, 2017  Regardless of whether there’s any truth to these avalanche of rumors, one thing’s certain: People will keep watching the family on TV, keep scouring social media for clues and will keep keeping up.  This story, originally published Sept. 27, has been updated.",1
"Hollywood’s awards season may have already kicked off with the National Review’s list of the best movies of the year, but it’ll really kick into gear when the Golden Globe nominations are announced Thursday morning. While most folks may want to just wait until the announcements after are made and read a list of nominees for Golden Globe awards (we see you, West Coast, where the announcement is happening at 5 a.m.), you do have the option to watch as the nominations are actually announced live.  The Golden Globe nomination ceremony will be delivered in two ways — one streaming and one on TV.

"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  Meghan Markle‘s dad is having a change in heart.  The 73-year-old announced Tuesday that he was going to try and walk his daughter down the aisle, despite his staged photo controversy — but was then forced to walk the statement back after learning from doctors that he needed heart surgery.  “They will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed,” Thomas Markle told TMZ.  The former television lighting director has been recovering from a heart attack he suffered last week, which left him with a “seriously damaged” heart. Thomas was reportedly back in the hospital on Tuesday undergoing a series of tests.  He had come forward on Monday and said he wasn’t going to be a part of Markle and Prince Harry’s nuptials because he didn’t want to embarrass her following the paparazzi photo controversy. But Thomas reportedly slept on it and changed his mind Tuesday morning.  “Of course I’d walk her down the aisle,” he told TMZ. “This is a historic moment.”  While Thomas initially thought the surgery wouldn’t complicate things, he said he now realizes how hard it would be to make the trip across the Pond.  In response to her father not making it, a spokesman for Kensington Palace released a statement late Monday saying: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  Thomas told TMZ that his daughter called him on Monday, but he missed the call. She reportedly texted him and said she loved him, was concerned about his health, and didn’t blame him for the staged photos.  The Daily Mail revealed Sunday that Thomas secretly collaborated with a paparazzi agency to set up the pics, which showed him reading stories about his daughter’s wedding and getting fitted for a suit.  Sources told The Post that he was “set up” by the LA-based company, identified as the Coleman-Rayner News Picture Agency.  They apparently took pics of Thomas drinking and entering a fleabag hotel — and threatened to release them if he didn’t agree to pose for them.  “They told him if he posed, they wouldn’t put out the other pictures,” a source explained. “They told him they’d make him look good. They also gave him a few bucks for his trouble.”  Coleman-Rayner did not immediately return calls or emails seeking comment about the alleged setup.  While Queen Elizabeth II was reportedly “very angry” about the photo controversy, Thomas told TMZ he didn’t think she really cared at all.  “I don’t think the queen is thinking about what I’m doing,” he said.",0
"Did you know who Kanye West was on October 23, 2002?  Maybe, if you were a hardcore rap fan, but probably not. Up to that point, Kanye West had a name mostly from his production work: the Chicago-native produced the bulk of Jay Z’s 2001 classic, The Blueprint. But he wasn’t known as a rapper: he would literally make his rapping debut a month later, appearing on Jay Z’s “The Bounce” (rapping as Ray Ray, for some reason).  But, in short, he was a nobody to most.  So when news came out that the rapper was in a serious car accident on October 23, 2002, many people just shrugged. No one knew that moment would probably end up being the most important moment of his career.  That night would be the inspiration for Kanye West’s first true big hit, “Through the Wire.”  But, what happened that night? Throughout the years, Kanye has told the story a number of times. Essentially, after finishing a late night session with Beanie Sigel, Peedi Crack and The Black Eyed Peas, Kanye left the studio in L.A., at around 3AM, in his rented Lexus. While in the car, he was cut off and he ran head-on into traffic, colliding with another car just blocks away from the W Hotel.  The accident was devastating; he had to have reconstructive surgery for his face. Kanye was laid up in the hospital for weeks. He had no health insurance, paying for everything out of pocket.  Years later, while pushing Late Registration, Kanye talked about the incident in an interview with USA Today, saying:  “When I had my accident, I was working on Beanie Sigel, Black Eyed Peas and Peedi Crack, and let’s just say that those tracks were not my best work. If I would have passed that night, that would have been the end of my legacy. Now when I go into the studio, I act like this could possibly be my last day.”  However, there are parts that Kanye seemed to have left out. Last year, DJ Whoo Kid, who apparently was in the studio before Kanye left, talked about what happened that night.  According to the DJ, Ludacris was also in the studio. Kanye, trying to impress everyone, started spitting verses that Ludacris wasn’t trying to hear:  “So Kanye’s looking crazy, you know, trying to impress Luda, but it wasn’t that time. Luda wanted to come in, do that verse and get the f–k out. So, what made it worse is he went out there and played a beat but by the time he got out there, Luda picked a Red Spyda beat. So now I gotta tell Kanye ‘Your services are not needed.’”  According to Whoo Kid, Kanye would leave the session furious.  Weeks after the accident, Kanye West would go back to the studio, loop up Chaka Khan’s “Through the Fire” and create “Through the Wire,” a song he rapped with a broken jaw.  The song wouldn’t reach the world until early 2003, when the track was on his debut mixtape, Get Well Soon. The tape was mostly a mixture of tracks that Kanye West produced. But there were also a couple of Kanye West songs, including unreleased classics like “Home” and “My Way.” (There were also a couple of tracks that would appear on College Dropout, like “Jesus Walks” and “Two Words”).  After the song floated on the mixtape scene for a while, Kanye West, who wasn’t getting much label support from Roc-A-Fella at the time, took $30 grand, hooked up with Coodie and Chike and shot a cozy video.  The video premiered in November 2003 and the rest is kinda history. The song was the first single off of Kanye West’s classic debut College Dropout, which released on February 10, 2004.  Nothing’s been the same since.",1
"SNL's Sudeikis reportedly proposed to Wilde over the holidays in Rome, where she has been shooting a movie. Someone who knows the couple described them as ""over the moon"" to the New York Post. Now, while we'd usually gloss over that line as standard PR-speak, we can't help but wonder whether the source was hinting at the location of Olivia Land — a magical and practical place Wilde described to Vulture in October. In Olivia Land, prostitution is legal, ""the streets are paved with dark chocolate,"" and ""people are free of body hair and menstrual cramps."" Sounds like the ideal place for a lasting marriage! On the other hand, Olivian law limits relationships to ""seven years, without an option to renew."" So, maybe just the ideal place for a nice marriage?",1

Although the low-key couple have yet to speak publicly about their relationship, they have been seen together holding hands and locking lips on multiple occasions since first stepping out in July 2017. Before romancing Portner, the Oscar nominee dated Samantha Thomas from September 2015 to early 2017.  Page has been open about her sexuality since coming out as gay on Valentine’s Day 2014. While speaking to The Hollywood Reporter in May 2014, the Juno star revealed that she is so “f—king happy” and “every tiny aspect of [her] life feels better.” Later that year, Page covered Out magazine and was honored as their Entertainer of the Year for making strides in the LGBT community.  The Inception actress also opened up about coming out during an interview with Stephen Colbert in September 2015. “I feel so grateful to feel how I feel now, compared to [how I felt] when I was a closeted person.

"The only budget Ted Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.""He talks tough on some of these issues,"" Rubio said Dec. 13. ""For example, he was going to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.We decided to fact-check Rubio’s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.Cruz’s vote on Rand Paul’s budget proposalRubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.Paul’s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.Rubio’s campaign pointed to Paul’s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.""Under Paul’s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.Was Paul’s proposal a ‘cut’ for defense?So why did Rubio refer to Paul’s budget as a ""cut"" if defense spending would rise?""We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,"" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul’s proposal a ""cut.""""Paul’s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president’s budget was an even larger increase),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But Paul’s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.""Paul’s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama’s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul’s budget a ""cut.""""As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,"" he said. ""This is misleading.""Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.""So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a ‘cut’ when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.""Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz’s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul’s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.""This was a budget, so it doesn’t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,"" Friedman said.Our rulingRubio said that the only budget Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio was referring to Cruz’s vote in favor of Paul’s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul’s plan when he called it a ""cut."" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul’s proposal for defense was below Obama’s request.We rate this statement Mostly False.",0
"The premium cable network has also announced that season four will bow in November.  No surprise here: Starz has extended Outlander for two additional seasons.  The premium cable network on Wednesday announced that it has renewed the Ron Moore drama based on Diana Gabaldon's best-selling book series for seasons five and six. Starz also revealed that the 13-episode fourth season of the time-traveling period soap will return in November. (A specific return date has yet to be announced.)  All told, the renewal is for 24 total episodes, with each season consisting of 12 episodes. That is Outlander's lowest per-season total after the freshman run consisted of 16 and seasons two and three were 13 apiece. From Sony Pictures Television and starring Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan, Outlander's seasons five and six will be based on material from the fifth and sixth books in Gabaldon's series, The Fiery Cross and A Breath of Snow and Ashes.  ""Fans can rest assured their beloved Claire and Jamie will be back facing new challenges, adversaries and adventures in seasons five and six as we delve into American history and continue the story of the Frasers as they settle in the New World,” Starz CEO Chris Albrecht said in a statement.  Season four is currently in production in Scotland and will consist of 13 episodes following Drums of Autumn, Gabaldon's fourth of eight books in the Outlander series. Season three averaged 5.8 million total viewers cross multiple platforms and ranks as the second-most-watched premium scripted series among women — behind only HBO's Game of Thrones.  In addition to Sony TV, Outlander is produced by Tall Ship Productions, Story Mining & Supply Co. and Left Bank Pictures. The drama is executive produced by Moore, Maril Davis, Toni Graphia, Matthew B. Roberts and Andy Harries.

"All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth.  Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady—PA Wire  While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle’s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy’s first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.  Markle’s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.  Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.  “The gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,” she says. “While it isn’t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‘expensive,’ the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.”  Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle’s wedding dress has an “absolutely American princess feel.” “Haute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,” she adds. “Safe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.”  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys—Pool/Reuters  The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.  Similarly, the wedding dress Markle’s sister-in-law — Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge — wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate’s parents paid £150,000 — about $203,000 — for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost £250,000 — about $338,000.  However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.  “I think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,” she told ET.  But Markle didn’t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana’s dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons.",1

"Tarana Burke, the activist who created the ""Me Too"" campaign back in 2007, which recently inspired an online movement against sexual assault and harassment, is leading us all into 2018.  Burke will be participating in New York's traditional New Year's Eve ceremony, according to a Monday press release. In honor of her efforts and social impact, she was chosen as the evening's special guest and will push the Waterford crystal button that drops the ball in Times Square starting the countdown to the new year.  Seems like 2018 is already looking up.  ""I am delighted to be participating in this momentous occasion,"" Burke said in a statement. ""I think it’s fitting to honor the Me Too movement as we close a historic year and set our intentions for 2018. With the new year comes new momentum to fuel this work and we won’t stop anytime soon.""  Welp! Looks like the cat is out of the bag. Yours truly will be pressing the Waterford crystal button to release the ball drop in Times Square on NYE. We are setting intentions for the new year. #metoo2018 pic.twitter.com/iYGfyvnvqJ — Tarana (@TaranaBurke) December 18, 2017  Burke's ""Me Too"" campaign gained traction this year after sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein began to surface. Actress Alyssa Milano used the #MeToo hashtag to encourage women to share their own stories of sexual harassment and assault, which was shared more than 100,000 times in its first 24 hours.  Earlier this month Time also revealed it would be honoring ""The Silence Breakers"" — all the women, including Burke, who spoke out against sexual assault and harassment this year — as 2017's ""Person of the Year.""  #MeToo played a key role in encouraging women and all those who've experienced sexual misconduct to share their voices and stand up for themselves, so the fact that Burke was chosen as the special guest by the event's co-organizers is sending a powerful message.  ""New Year’s is a time when we look at the most significant cultural and political moments of the last year, when we look for inspiration by honoring and giving a global platform to those who have made a difference,"" Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, said in the release.  ""Tarana Burke’s courage and foresight have changed the world this year, and, we hope, forever,"" he added.  As the activist tweeted alongside her Twitter announcement, ""We are setting intentions for the new year.""",0
"Southern Charm star Kathryn Dennis dropped a bombshell on this season of the Bravo series, when she revealed she and her castmate Shep Rose had been secretly hooking up through the years.  So, during an appearance on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live on Monday night, host Andy Cohen grilled Shep about his ‘sexy times’ with Kathryn. Shep also dropped a shocker when he revealed that at one point, Craig Conover was actually trying to date Kathryn, plus he shared that Ashley Jacob’s behavior was actually worse than what was shown on the show.  If you recall, Kathryn, 24, and Shep, 38, had a one night stand during season one of Southern Charm before Kathryn started dating Thomas Ravenel. Many fans of the show had thought it was a one and done deal until Kathryn revealed on this season that they had hooked up a few more times over the years.  First, Andy asked Shep who initiated their hookups again.  “Well, we met at one of my bars. And we had a couple of drinks and it was just like on fire again,” said Shep.  The question then turned to the number of times Shep and Kathryn have hooked up over the years.  “Total? Probably like six or seven,” he revealed. “Originally, I was [her booty call]. We were each other’s booty calls. Then she fell back with Whitney [Sudler-Smith] and Thomas, and I was like ‘no, no, no.'”  Andy also wanted to know if the two go out on dates first before hooking up. “No, no,” laughed Shep, adding: “But I would go on a date with her!”  Shep was then asked if anyone on the cast was aware of his secret hookups with Kathryn before it was revealed on the show this year.  “Well, yeah because I kind of stole her from Craig. Craig was courting her but he slept in her bed two nights in a row and didn’t try anything. And I was like ‘what are you doing?’ so I was like I’ll try some things,” he stated , giving female fans of the show once more reason to love Craig !  Finally, Shep was questioned about Thomas’s girlfriend Ashley, who has received a TON of backlash this season due to the way she has treated Kathryn, which includes calling her an “egg donor.” According to Shep, what viewers saw on the show is actually tame in comparison to what actually went down during the cast’s drama-filled vacation.  “She was so emboldened and walking around like she owned the place, when what she should have been doing is ‘hey, I’m really sorry about last night’ because we were having a good time on Daufuskie Island,” said Shep. “We were eating well and drinking well, and she said some things that were so inappropriate.”  He added, “the audience doesn’t even know the half of what she actually said.”  Shep also wondered why Thomas has yet to break up with Ashley, stating Thomas “would have all the support in the world if he said no thank you” to his relationship.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of “American Idol,” the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.  After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning.  “Is it OK if I announce this big news?” talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. “I’ve been waiting and waiting.”  With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, “We’ve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‘American Idol,’” prompting cheers from the studio audience.  Seacrest has co-hosted ABC’s morning talk show with Ripa since May.  The radio and TV personality, who will continue to host “Live with Kelly and Ryan” from New York, said he was “very, very excited” about reprising his “American Idol” duties. He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles.  “It’s genuinely hard to put into words what ‘American Idol’ means to me,” Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. “I’m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it’s allowed me to experience.”  The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.  The glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.  FILE PHOTO: Show host Ryan Seacrest addresses the audience during the American Idol Grand Finale in Hollywood, California April 7, 2016. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo  Within the United States, the “American Idol” phenomenon spawned a host of competing shows such as NBC’s “The Voice,” CBS’s “Rock Star”, and Fox’s “The X Factor.”  Pop star Katy Perry, who is set to judge the next generation of artists on the show, took to Twitter to express her excitement about the news and sing the praises of Seacrest.  “I’m spicy, @RyanSeacrest is seasoned!” wrote Perry. “All the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.”",0

"The West family is one bigger!  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed their third child on Monday, as their surrogate gave birth to a baby girl, Kardashian shared on her website.  ""Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,"" the mom of three wrote, adding ""we're so in love"" in the post titled, ""she's here.""  A source tells ET that Kim and Kanye were in the delivery room when their surrogate gave birth to their baby girl at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The couple was joined by Kris Jenner and Kim's sisters at the hospital, however, the family was not in the delivery room.  ""We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care. North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister.""  Their new bundle of joy weighed in at 7lbs, 6 oz and was born at 12:47 am. Kardashian has yet to reveal her name.  Baby No. 3 joins older siblings, 4-year-old North and 2-year-old Saint. Kim and Kanye opted for a surrogate to have their third child, after Kim's first two notoriously difficult pregnancies.  ""They are fully prepared and can't wait to bring their baby home,"" a source told ET earlier this week. The name of their baby has not yet been revealed.  ""If they've chosen a name, they're keeping it very private,"" the source revealed. ""They may not even have one yet -- and might not choose something until they meet the baby!""  Though both the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and the 40-year-old rapper were in the delivery room, the birth of the baby was not filmed for their E! reality show. In fact, the surrogate's privacy has been extremely important to the husband-and-wife duo, a source told ET back in September.  ""This was always the plan. After the complications with the other pregnancies, they knew they wanted to go the surrogacy route for the next baby,"" the source added.  Last fall, Kim admitted to ET that the surrogate experience has been ""really different.""  ""Anyone that says or thinks it is just the easy way out is just completely wrong,"" the KUWTK star said. ""I think it is so much harder to go through it this way, because you are not really in control. And, you know, obviously you pick someone that you completely trust and that you have a good bond and relationship with, but... knowing that I was able to carry my first two babies and not my baby now, it's hard for me. So, it's definitely a harder experience than I anticipated just in the control area.""

"Eric Deggans:  Well, I do think what's interesting to me about this show is that it didn't really explore the roots of why somebody like Roseanne Conner, who, when we last saw her, you know, was supporting abortion rights, supported gay rights, trying to investigate on her own whether she and her husband had unwittingly transmitted racist views to their son, when he didn't want to kiss a black girl in a school pageant, how somebody like that came to believe that voting for Donald Trump was something that made sense, when Hillary Clinton seemed to be much more in line with those values.  And I don't think the show really investigated that. And that felt like a lost opportunity. When the show was at its height, they spent two episodes looking at how all the characters on that show felt about abortion.  The episodes that I talked about with D.J., Roseanne's son, and racism, they spent a whole episode exploring how he might have come to feel that way and how Roseanne and Dan may have unwittingly contributed to that.  The discuss that we saw in this new ""Roseanne"" was basically a series of sort of jabs and insults traded between two characters. They didn't take a lot of time to sort of investigate how Roseanne may have come to feel the way she felt or how other people in her family may have felt about it. A lot of it was implied.  And I noticed when I tried to talk to the cast about this, when I tried to talk to Roseanne about this back in January, that they were a little hesitant to talk about the political implications of what they were doing and why they were making the choices that they were making to make Roseanne a Trump supporter in the first place.",0

It was an honour to inaugurate the first sanitary pad manufacturing unit set up by us in South Africa”[89]  Apart from the launch of the sanitary pad unit, Mandela’s birthday was celebrated by handing out more than 200 blankets and winter hats to the elderly at the newly opened 'Nosekeni Nongaphi Health Center'.[90] The Miss World team also donated 100 bicycles to school children in Mvezo, Mandela's home village.[91][92]  Chhillar reached London and took her first inter-city rail journey from Euston railway station to the Birmingham International, to meet the contestants of Miss England 2018.[93] She joined Stephanie Hill, Miss World Europe 2017 for the presentation of £15,000 raised by the charity projects of Miss England contestants.

"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split in 2016 and are engaged in a custody battle for children - Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9. Recently, a judge handed out a new schedule ordering Angeline Jolie to give Brad Pitt more time with the kids. Brad is allowed to meet his children without Angelina's permission as it was stated that, ""the children not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them."" The court even stated that the actress could risk losing primary custody of the children if she didn’t follow the order.  This decision has left Angelina fuming, as per a report in Radar Online. Angelina is now determined to expose details of the infamous fight that led to their separation in 2016.  “Angie’s going to paint her life with Brad as a living hell. She’s told friends she’s kept a vivid account of Brad’s boozing, violent rages and volatile behavior. The way things are shaping up, she’ll have no option but to pull out the diary if she wants to win this custody battle,” a source told Radar Online.  “Nobody outside the family, the flight crew and the feds know what went down, but Angie will make it known in her journal. Angie has said the diary will be very damaging to Brad’s custody hopes. She’s calling it her trump card,” the insider revealed.  Angelina Jolie is living with her kids in London currently where she is filming Maleficent 2.",1
"Roseanne Barr is still devastated two weeks after her racist Twitter rant led to the swift cancellation of her self-titled hit ABC show.  Though she tweeted she’s “fine” on June 13, Barr “is going off the deep end,” a source exclusively told RadarOnline.com, adding the comedienne’s behind-the-scenes meltdown is “worse than Kathy Griffin‘s.”  As Radar reported, CNN ended its deal with Griffin in May 2017 after she held a fake decapitated head resembling that of President Donald Trump. She then had an on-camera meltdown that had her friends and family worried she had become “unhinged.”  PHOTOS: Roseanne Barr’s Biggest Secrets & Scandals Exposed  As for Barr, she’s still threatening to release emails of “support” by ABC and her co-stars, as Radar reported exclusively.  “Roseanne thinks her career is over and she’s never going to work again,” said the insider. “She’s being told by close friends and family not to release emails.”  “But others are telling her from a PR perspective that when Kathy went scorched earth she only ended up being exiled for nine months.”  PHOTOS: Fat To Fit!

"Khloe Kardashian is officially not here to take anyone’s shit. And we love her for it.  Yesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a “source” that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she’s keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  “Khloe wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet,” the source said. “She does talk about a future with Tristan, though. She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”  Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?",1
"It’s poetic justice that the pickpocket in Ocean’s 8 handily steals every scene she’s in. Constance has a few killer moments in a crowded heist movie, and leaves the audience wanting more.  advertisement  advertisement  They won’t be waiting long. At a recent Ocean’s 8 screening in Manhattan, the performer who plays Constance, Awkwafina, described herself as “the least important person in this room.” (In her defense, said room also contained Mindy Kaling, Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, and Anne Hathaway.) Awkwafina (real name Nora Lum) thrives on self-deprecating humor, but even she seems aware that her perceived importance is surging by the day. Beyond the powerhouse, Bechdel Test-obliterating Ocean’s 11 reboot, the well-hyphened Awkwafina is blowing up in every direction, with new movies, music, and a TV show on the way. Pretty soon, there will be far fewer rooms she enters in which she isn’t the attentional bullseye dead center. The room where I meet Lum is tucked inside the lavish Whitby Hotel in midtown. It’s nearly big enough to run laps in. She seems laid back and comfortable occupying this space and holding court with interviewers, though, even if she quickly cops to being stunned by the star treatment. “Yesterday, I had a designated security guard named Phil,” she says, shaking her head in a mild daze. “This whole thing has been insane.” The Queens native first began to sow her creative oats at LaGuardia High School, forever known as the Fame school, where she dabbled in a little bit of everything artistic. Going to the school also opened up the city for her beyond Queens, exposing New York’s heavy-beating cultural heart. Lum came up with the sobriquet Aquafina at 16, just because she liked the way it sounded. She wouldn’t actually adopt it (or change the spelling for legal purposes) until years later. She also started making beats on her MacBook around this time, influenced by hometown heroes like A Tribe Called Quest. Today, Lum seems half-proud, half-embarrassed that the thing that ultimately changed her life was a three-minute rap called “My Vag.” Considering that her breakout movie role is in a gender-flipped reboot, it’s fitting that her first song was a feminized reimagining of Mickey Avalon’s raunch-rap anthem, “My Dick.” She wrote “My Vag” early in college, then kept it on ice for five years, as she tried to figure out what to do with her life.  advertisement  “I was just kind of slumming it,” she says. “I didn’t know if I could make ‘Awkwafina’ work.” She spent time behind the counter of a bodega. She worked for a while at an air conditioning company. She did a bunch of under-the-table odd jobs, and had stints at a major Japanese restaurant and in a publishing house publicity department. She was stationed at her most comfortable office job yet when, in 2012, she finally decided to make a real run at Awkwafina. Lum worked with director Court Dunn to make the legit-looking video for “My Vag.” Awkwafina’s debut is a delightful absurdity that alternates between rooftop stunting and a G-rated gynecological excavation, where the star extracts a Big Gulp and way too much police tape from a woman in stirrups. Worried that her employers would recognize her, Lum donned a pair of disco glasses to obscure her face, creating part of what became her signature look. She comes across in the video as equal parts ultrahip NYC club kid and approachable goofball. When “My Vag” came out, the creator sat watching viewer stats rise like a stock ticker: 100, 4000, 70,000. Perhaps they’d climb high enough to lead to something, the demand for more music at the very least. (The tally now stands at 2.4 million views.) Before she could figure out her next move, though, her employer did recognize her from the viral video and she got fired. It was more of a boost than a blow, injecting Lum with a no-plan-B sense of urgency. She had a brand now, and a calling card. Awkwafina was a go. “It all happened very quickly,” she says. “My phone just started ringing. That video hit way harder than I ever thought.” Other videos followed, but Lum didn’t wait long before seizing her first opportunity to branch out. The production company Astronauts Wanted, which worked with Vine celebrities like Cameron Dallas and Nash Grier, reached out and asked if she had any ideas. She did. She imagined an Awkwafina talk show, where she would vamp around New York City, interviewing homeless people and prostitutes. Astronauts Wanted assured her that was not possible. They compromised, though, and created Tawk, a show for Verizon go90 where Lum interviewed comedians and actors like Phoebe Robinson and Alia Shawkat in between sketches and rap interludes. The roving talk show filmed in bodegas on the Lower East Side or laundromats in Bushwick. It gave fans of her rapping a chance to hear her sandpaper-raspy speaking voice and see her ecstatic, IDGAF dance moves.  advertisement  Lum quickly became super busy, making her 2014 album, Yellow Rangers, while also working on her talk show and somehow finding the time to write a book, Awkwafina’s NYC. She also got cast on MTV’s comedy advice show, Girl Code. From an early age, Lum had always wanted to be on television; now she was. She hadn’t really considered acting as a career possibility, though, at least not until Seth Rogen and some fellow producers saw the video for “My Vag,” and thought Lum should be in Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising. It was a level-jump that seemed to come out of nowhere. “I just never expected that I would be needed for acting,” she says. “But when I was on air for Tawk or for Girl Code, I was able to harness this kind of creative ability that I couldn’t do in lyrics or a musical setting and acting bleeds into that. I’m able to give something else to this collaborative project I couldn’t really do musically and I love that shit.” The opportunities continued pouring in after she got cast in Neighbors 2–just not exactly the right ones. Lum was proud of her heritage (she’s the product of a South Korean immigrant mother and a first-generation Chinese-American father) and she didn’t want to compromise its integrity based on whatever Hollywood happened to be seeking at the moment. “I started to get a lot of auditions that were really weird side roles for Asian characters, where either they brought out all those old tropes or they were just an added Benetton effect, a visual thing,” she says. “Those roles I didn’t take to, they just weren’t for me, so I chose other ones very quickly.” Her next two projects proved pivotal. One was Salima Koroma’s documentary, Bad Rap, which placed Awkwafina within the broader context of the Asian-American hip-hop community, and the other was the Kush-scented coming-of-age comedy, Dude, which is out now on Netflix. The latter project introduced Lum to its up-and-coming writer/director Olivia Milch, who at the time was also penning the screenplay for Ocean’s 8, a film with an open role perfect for a plucky ingenue. The Ocean’s 8 character Lum ended up playing has an identity that has nothing to do with her ethnicity. She’s a blink-and-you’ve-been-robbed pickpocket, and a woman after the star’s own heart.  advertisement  “What I liked about Constance and what drew me in is that she’s not just a New Yorker, she’s from Queens and her fiber is very much a product of that environment,” Lum says. “Her hustle–dreaming of a better life and how to hustle your way into it–that is Awkwafina’s story too, and it bled very well into my own life.” In the film, we meet Constance while she is scamming Queens pedestrians at Three-card Monte. To prepare for the scene, Lum studied auctioneers and street hustlers religiously (though she once saw her own dad get duped at the game.) She was also paired with a sleight-of-hand coach for the film, who she inevitably befriended and cadged some David Blaine secrets from. (“I can entertain kids for days now,” she notes.) Later this summer, Lum will also appear in Crazy Rich Asians, a comedy her costar Jimmy O. Yang describes as “the Asian Black Panther.” In a sprawling cast, Lum plays headliner Constance Wu’s quirky best friend, Goh Peik Lin, who gets all the hot lines. As a big fan of the popular Kevin Kwan book the film is based on, Lum felt like she was in a Harry Potter movie, more or less. She worried about shattering the image of the character fans had in their heads. By the time she got on set, though, she was feeling confident about her acting. “One thing that’s cool about both Crazy Rich Asians and Ocean’s 8, is that both directors trusted in my ability to improv and that trust leads me to trust myself even more and whatever I’m doing,” says Lum. Her confidence will be put to the test soon as she puts the finishing touches on the show she’s currently developing for Comedy Central. (A new rap EP is on the way as well. It is not clear when, if ever, Lum actually sleeps.) Awkwafina, which the star is writing and producing with Teresa Hsiao and showrunner Karey Dornetto, is a narrative series steeped in the ridiculousness of growing up in Queens and trying to make it big. After years of living through that process, Lum is ready to look back and wring some well-earned laughs from it. “I wanted it to be a story about New York told by a POC New Yorker, which is something you don’t see,” she says. “You see some POC-led shows that take place in New York but not by someone who’s actually from there. Especially Queens. It’s such a different existence and such a different cast of people out there, and you never see them reflected on TV. I know that I’m searching for that and I wanted the show to reflect it.”  advertisement  With all of these projects bubbling up, the hype around Lum is now in dangerous proximity to her head. At the moment, though, she’s not personally buying into it–private security guards named Phil, be damned. “I will never believe that I’m as cool as some people have made it out to be,” she vows. “But I think that’s a good thing, because then I’d be an asshole.”",0

"Roy Halladay, a two-time Cy Young Award winner admired as much for his off-the-field persona as his Hall of Fame pitching ability, died Tuesday when the private plane he was piloting crashed off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico.  A fearsome competitor on the mound, Halladay, 40, earned universal appreciation within the sport, from teammates and opponents alike. He was one of 23 pitchers to throw a perfect game, and joined the Yankees’ Don Larsen as the only two to fire a no-hitter in the postseason.  Halladay did it for the Phillies in his playoff debut, on Oct. 6, 2010, and came within a fifth-inning walk to the Reds’ Jay Bruce of also being perfect that remarkable evening at Citizens Bank Park. The baseball world was in shock Tuesday after learning of Halladay’s fatal accident, which came only four years after his retirement from the Phillies, his 16-year career prematurely ended by his decision to avoid back surgery.  “We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay’s untimely death,” the Phillies said in a statement. “There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.”  Halladay recently purchased the A5 ICON, a two-seat, single-engine amphibious plane capable of landing on water, and his Twitter feed was filled with photographs of him flying the aircraft. According to the Pasco County (Fla.) Police Department, the plane went down in the water, about a quarter-mile offshore, and Halladay died in the crash. There was no one else traveling with him.  Halladay’s accident is the latest in a number of plane crashes that have claimed the lives of prominent baseball players. The Pirates’ Roberto Clemente perished while on a relief mission to Nicaragua on New Year’s Eve in 1972, the Yankees’ Thurman Munson crashed while piloting his own plane near his Ohio home, and another Yankee, Cory Lidle, died when his plane collided with a Manhattan apartment building in 2006.  “Our hearts are broken,” said Tony Clark, the union’s executive director and a former player. “Roy Halladay was not just one of the greatest competitors, but was also among the best men in our generation of players.  Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.  “Our paths crossed many times during our careers, and I can tell you he was among the toughest pitchers I ever faced. But while he never gave in on the mound, he was known in both leagues as an outstanding teammate, a guy who would go out of his way to help other players.”  Halladay, nicknamed “Doc,” was a throwback. As baseball gradually moved to de-emphasize the starting pitcher, he still took pride in going the distance, with 67 complete games, including 20 shutouts. An eight-time All-Star, Halladay also was a three-time 20-game winner, twice during his 12-year stint in Toronto. Halladay will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2019.  “The Blue Jays organization is overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one of the franchise’s greatest and most respected players, but even better human being,” the team said in a statement. “It is impossible to express what he has meant to this franchise, the city and its fans.”  In addition to his impact on baseball, Halladay left a lasting imprint on his Florida community, with the Pasco County Police struggling both to investigate the crash and mourn a friend.  “He was one in a million,” Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco told The Associated Press. “It is a true loss for us.”  Nick Fanti, the former Hauppauge High School pitching standout, fondly remembered Halladay after having him as an instructor at the Phillies’ camp in spring training.  “I was fortunate enough to work with Roy Halladay and can honestly say I’m not only a better baseball player, but a better person off the field for it,” Fanti tweeted. “To be able to listen to him talk about his process and how he played the game was an honor. Truly a professional and a legend and will be missed.”  Halladay is survived by his wife, Brandy, and two sons, Ryan and Braden.  Former and current players flocked to Twitter to express their condolences, with Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy summing up a generation’s feelings.  “Roy Halladay was your favorite player’s favorite player,” McCarthy tweeted. “A true ace and a wonderful person. Heartbroken for those who knew him best.”",0
"Series creator Ryan Murphy first shared the news over the weekend, saying he made the decision to honor victims' rights.  Tuesday's episode of American Horror Story: Cult, which was set to feature a scene in which a mass shooting occurs, has been edited to be less graphic following the deadly Las Vegas shooting in which 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured.  Ryan Murphy, co-creator and showrunner of the FX horror anthology, first made the comments Saturday during a New Yorker Festival discussion. The scene in question was filmed before the shooting in Las Vegas occurred, with Murphy explaining that they shot the sequence in September even though they're still filming this season (several of the actors have already wrapped). ""I just made the decision that I'm going to have all of that violence be shown for the most part off camera,"" he said of editing the episode after it was in the can and locked before the tragedy in Vegas.  On Monday, FX confirmed the episode would see ""substantial"" edits for Tuesday's telecast but that the original unedited episode would then be released on VOD and streaming platforms.  ""In light of the tragedy last week in Las Vegas, Ryan Murphy and the producers of American Horror Story: Cult have chosen to make substantial edits to the opening scene of [Tuesday] night’s episode,"" FX said in a statement. ""This opening, which was filmed two months ago and which portrays an occurrence of gun violence that has sadly become all too common in our country, contains a sequence that some viewers might find traumatic.""  The network says the edited episode will air on the FX linear channel, while the unedited and original version will be available on the VOD platform of cable, satellite or telco providers, as well as on the FX Networks non-linear platforms, FXNOW and FX+.  When speaking about the decision on Saturday with the New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum, Murphy said he felt a ""responsibility"" to victims of gun violence.  ""Nobody ever talks about victims' rights. That's sort of a weird emotional discussion that's never bridged,"" Murphy added. ""But I felt great sympathy for people who were affected, certainly, and family members and loved ones and people who are upset about the way the world is.""  Murphy explained that there was a conversation about what to do with the AHS episode in the wake of the shooting: ""Should you air it? Should you not air it? How do you be sensitive?""  ""My point of view was I believe I have the right to air it, but I also believe in victims' rights, and I believe that now is probably not the week to have something explosive or incendiary in the culture because someone who was affected might watch that and it could trigger something or make them feel upset. So our decision was to re-edit it and I felt that that was the right move,"" he said.  The scene was graphic, Murphy said, in order to make ""an obvious anti-gun warning about society.""  The seventh season of the horror anthology show, which stars Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters, follows the rise of a cult led by Peters' fictional character. The post-election set season explores how someone can rise within a disenfranchised community. Throughout the season, Peters will embody five other notorious real-life cult leaders, from Charles Manson to David Koresh.  This is not the first time a show has had to change a scene or delay the viewing of an episode in response to real-world events. USA's Mr. Robot delayed its season-one finale, which featured a character killing themselves on television, similar to the events of the Virginia TV shooting in which a reporter was killed on-air.  Similarly, USA delayed the premiere of its Ryan Phillippe-starrer Shooter in the wake of a deadly Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas where a sniper attack by a disgraced military vet killed five police officers.  Murphy's comments were part of a wide-ranging discussion of his career and many TV series, past, present and future. He revealed the fate of the Cult episode as part of a response to a question from Nussbaum about people being offended by things on his shows and what offends him.

"It's been another eventful year for the British royal family, from Princess Charlotte's first royal curtsy to the 70th wedding anniversary of her great grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. There's also another royal baby on the way for Kate Middleton and Prince William, along with a royal wedding to look forward to in 2018. Below, a look back at some of the more exciting moments from Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, and beyond.  1. When Kate, Will, and Harry raced each other to promote mental health (February 5)  As part of their Heads Together organization, Their Royal Highnesses hit the running track at Olympic Park with folks training for the 2017 London Marathon. While Kate was the only one properly dressed for the race, she finished last.  2. When Kate and Will looked like a million bucks at the 70th EE British Academy Film Awards (February 12)  Getty  Kate’s off-the-shoulder gown, complete with a gorgeous bouquet print, was made possible by one of her favorite fashion houses, Alexander McQueen. Prince William looked pretty great in his tux, too.  3. When Queen Elizabeth met an elephant (April 10)  Getty  Yes, that’s the Queen feeding a banana to Donna the elephant. The Duke of Edinburgh was also on hand to help open the new Centre for Elephant Care at Whipsnade Zoo, the UK's biggest zoo, in Bedfordshire, England.  4. When Kate was photographed curtsying to Queen Elizabeth on Easter Sunday (April 16)  Getty  As per royal etiquette, one should curtsy upon seeing the Queen for the first time on any given day. This meeting generally takes place behind closed doors, so royal enthusiasts welcomed this photograph, which also showed William bowing, with open arms.  5. When William and Lady Gaga FaceTimed to talk about mental health (April 18)  The Duke of Cambridge and @LadyGaga join forces to encourage more people to speak openly about their mental health #OKtosay pic.twitter.com/kCuQyS3Svn — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 18, 2017  As part of Kate, William, and Harry’s latest #oktosay series with their Heads Together campaign, William and Lady Gaga opened up about their personal struggles in a four-minute video call, which was shared on the singer and the Prince’s social media platforms. “For me, the little bits that I’ve learnt so far is that it’s really important to have this conversation. You won’t be judged,” William said in the clip.  6. When Kate, William, and Harry cheered on runners at the 2017 London Marathon (April 22)  Imagine getting a (foam) high five from the Duchess of Cambridge while clocking in another mile! At one point, a runner squirted some water at Prince William, who definitely did not see the droplets coming.    Getty  Getty  7. When the Cambridges unveiled a new Princess Charlotte photo ahead of her 2nd birthday (April 30)  HRH The Duchess of Cambridge via Getty Images  Courtesy of budding photographer, the Duchess of Cambridge.    8. When Prince George and Princess Charlotte stole the show at their Aunt Pippa’s wedding to James Matthews (May 19)  Getty  Getty  BRB squealing over these precious photos for the 29th time.  9. When Prince George and Princess Charlotte stole the show at the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony (June 17)  Getty  Getty  Charlotte and George looking at planes is too cute for words.  10. When Kate arrived at the Royal Ascot celebrations in white lace (June 19)  Getty  Yes, that’s Alexander McQueen again.  11. When Canadian Governor General David Johnston broke royal protocol and touched Queen Elizabeth’s arm (July 19)  Getty  During a Canada 150 celebration in London, Johnston found himself in the middle of a teeny tiny scandal when he was spotted grazing the royal elbow of Queen Elizabeth II as they made their way down some carpeted steps. As he later explained to CBC News, “I’m certainly conscious of the protocol. I was just anxious to be sure there was no stumbling on the steps… It’s a little bit awkward, that descent from Canada House to Trafalgar Square, and there was carpet that was a little slippy, so I thought perhaps it was appropriate to breach protocol just to be sure there was no stumble.”  12. When Princess Charlotte delivered her first-ever royal curtsy (July 19)  Adorable Princess Charlotte pic.twitter.com/QL5I01HhxC — The Telegraph (@Telegraph) July 19, 2017  It happened moments before Charlotte boarded the plane in Warsaw, Poland, for Berlin with her brother George and their parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Upon landing in Berlin, Charlotte also perfectly executed her first diplomatic handshake. Well done, Princess!    So cute!

When Kate and Will made pretzels during an official royal visit to Germany (July 20)  Getty  Yeah, they should keep their day jobs.  14. When Prince George had this reaction while checking out helicopter models in Hamburg, Germany (July 21)  Getty  Adorable and relatable.  15. When Kensington Palace released a new photo of Prince George ahead of his fourth birthday (July 21)  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  16. When Prince Philip made his final solo appearance at an official event (August 2)  Back in May, Philip announced his retirement after completing more than 22,000 solo appearances over 70 years ever since becoming a member of the British royal family. For his final solo appearance, the 96-year-old bowed out with a tribute from the Royal Marines on a rainy day at Buckingham Palace.  17. When Kate announced that she was pregnant with baby number three (September 4)  In a statement shared on its social media channels, Kensington Palace confirmed that the Duke and Duchess were “very pleased” to announce George and Charlotte’s future sibling. According to The Daily Mail, Kate is due around April or May 2018.  Read the press release in full ↓ pic.twitter.com/vDTgGD2aGF — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) September 4, 2017  18. When George posed with his dad for this perfect first day of school photo (September 7)  Chris Jackson | Getty  4-year-old George reported for his first day of full-time education at Thomas’s Battersea while accompanied by his dad, Prince William, and Helen Haslem, the head of lower school. His little walk to school was later shared on Kensington Palace’s official Instagram account.  19. When Prince Charles hung out with some sheep (September 14)  This year’s Westmorland Show in Cumbria welcomed a royal judge in Prince Charles, who revealed in 2016 that he’s successfully used homeopathy to treat his cattle and sheep to reduce the use of antibiotics.    20. When Prince Harry and girlfriend Meghan Markle made their first official public appearance together in Toronto (September 25)  Getty  Getty  The sighting was a momentous one for fans of the couple, who were first romantically linked in the fall of 2016. Their public debut, which happened at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto, also came weeks after Meghan opened up about their relationship in Vanity Fair. “I can tell you that at the end of the day I think it’s really simple. We’re two people who are really happy and in love.”  21. When Prince Harry sat front row with Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Dr. Jill Biden at the Invictus Games (September 29)  Getty  Wow thanks for the invite, you guys.  22. When a pregnant Kate danced with Paddington Bear (October 16)  Getty  Getty  In a surprise royal visit, Kate joined Prince William and Prince Harry at an event celebrating kids aboard the British Pullman, sister to the Orient Express train. Paddington Bear was also there to represent the cast of the upcoming Paddington 2 movie and somehow convinced the Duchess to show off a few dance moves on the platform.  22. When Prince Harry and Michelle Obama surprised a group of students in Chicago (October 31)  The 20 lucky students got the meeting of a lifetime at Hyde Park Academy, which sits across the future site of the Obama Presidential Center on the South Side of Chicago. Harry later spoke at the Obama Foundation Summit.  23. When Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip celebrated 70 years of marriage (Nov. 20)  Ahead of the big day, new photographs of the Queen and His Royal Highness were released on the official Royal Family Facebook page and other social media platforms. According to the release, the portraits were taken inside the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle by British photographer Matt Holyoak of Camera Press in early November.  On the day of their anniversary, Elizabeth and Philip were joined by family and close friends for a celebration at Windsor Castle. Among those in attendance: Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince Harry, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, and Prince Edward.    Getty  24.

"Tom Cruise truly is as great as he seems. The cast of Mission: Impossible-Fallout learned firsthand just how impressive the star was throughout the course of their filming. From stopping mid-take to ask extras if they were okay, to expertly maneuvering a helicopter in the mountains, Cruise won over the hearts of the star studded group, including Henry Cavill. “I am not easily impressed, and I know some people who have done genuinely seriously impressive stuff, and watching Tom do these stunts, especially in the mountains in that helicopter. I just thought, ‘Okay I am officially impressed,'” the Superman actor shared.  He added, “This is ridiculous what he is doing. And he learns all these skills for these movies and does them to an elite level. It is remarkable, truly remarkable.” Aside from being an amazing stuntman, the actors added that he is genuinely a good person, with Angela Bassett saying, “He truly is just incredibly warm, generous, embracing. As soon as he turns to see you he breaks out into this great smile and just welcomes you with a warm smile.”  For Rebecca Ferguson, she said the actor has the ability to make you feel like “you are the center of the room.”Simon Pegg on the other hand, just feels uncomfortable. “He compliments you a lot and he looks at you and it gets uncomfortable because you get so much Cruise love on you. People are always so all over on him, so I think he likes to redistribute it,” the Brit joked.  The general consensus though is that the Top Gun star is a just a normal guy, despite all the mystery that surrounds him. “He allows himself to be surrounded by a lot of mystique and conjecture and gossip and he just sort of lets it fester and I think that makes people think he is some sort of inhuman kind of thing, but he is just a bloke,” Pegg explained. Fans of the 56-year-old are delighted https://www.instagram.com/p/BiC6IVODUeD/?taken-by=tomcruiseby his return to the public eye as he travels the world to promote the most recent installment of the franchise. More recently, he has joined Jimmy Fallon for a hilarious round of Mad Lib Theatre, before crossing the country to join James Corden as he skydived for the first time.  Even as he excels as Ethan Hunt, it’s been hard for the actor to duplicate that magic in other would-be franchises.The last couple of years have not been kind to Tom Cruise’s status as an action hero. In 2016, he played the taciturn Jack Reacher again in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, following that in 2017 as the lead of The Mummy and American Made. All three of those movies stumbled in one way or another — American Made acquitted itself best of all and received strong reviews, but it was not exactly a runaway hit. Meanwhile, The Mummy doomed a shared universe before it began and Jack Reacher earned $56 million less globally than its predecessor.  That impact? No joke. #MissionImpossible A post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) on Jun 18, 2018 at 12:09pm PDT  As Cruise is only four years away from 60 — yes, really — it’s not wrong to wonder if his action-star days are far behind him. But Mission: Impossible – Fallout suggests he’s got some life in him yet.Throughout the last two decades, Cruise has excelled when he plays IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Hunt was first introduced in the 1996 movie adaptation of the 1960s TV show, Mission: Impossible, pulling off a daring and breathtaking break-in of CIA headquarters, fending off an attack by a man in a helicopter while hanging for his life on the top of a fast-moving train and more. As Cruise has grown older, he’s worked more often in action films than dramas — in between the first and second M:I films, Cruise co-starred in Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, a one-two punch he’s not replicated since — but he’s never better than when playing the beleaguered IMF agent.  Fallout could easily have felt like more of the same, were it not for, among other things, Cruise’s fierce commitment to doing whatever he has to do to entertain people. Here, that means “nearly killing himself.” Not every one of this film’s 147 minutes is dedicated to action sequences that seem to catalogue the ways in which Tom Cruise could have died on set — the pre-title sequence is both ominous and deliciously twisty without featuring any severe action. But once Ethan and his not-entirely-willing new partner, CIA agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill), have to do a HALO jump from above 20,000 feet in the air into a Parisian nightclub, Fallout isn’t playing around. Yes, Cruise pulled off that jump, just like he climbed up a rope to take over a helicopter mid-flight and jumped from one London building to another. (Of course, as you may know, he broke his ankle in the process, in a shot that’s in the finished film.)  It’s difficult to know exactly what makes the Mission: Impossible franchise so special for Cruise, what makes it work so well for his intense persona. Movies like Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and The Mummy suggest that Cruise is looking for other franchises on which to work in between making M:I adventures. (Seeing that Cruise is co-starring in a Top Gun sequel next only furthers this notion.) But few of those capture the ineffable essence of Cruise the way that Ethan Hunt does. In Fallout, Hunt is at his most desperate. One of Ethan’s refrains in Fallout feels like a Cruise mission statement: “I’ll figure it out!” The tension in that statement is always in wondering how. Ethan, of course, does figure things out at the last second, but how he does is always thrilling.  The same can’t be said for those other would-be franchises. (Hard to believe that we’re only a year removed from Universal announcing that so-called Dark Universe with The Mummy, which was a real don’t-count-your-chickens-until-they’ve-hatched situation.) Part of it falls to something Cruise can’t control: his age. In Fallout, both Michelle Monaghan and Rebecca Ferguson return to play important women in Ethan’s life, even though both actresses are a great deal younger than him. It was laughable in last year’s The Mummy when Cruise’s hero had a love interest who was young enough to be his daughter, just as it was laughable when the main character was referred to as younger than Dr. Jekyll, played by Russell Crowe (who is younger than Cruise). In Fallout, at least, there is an unavoidable sense that Ethan is getting wearier, physically and mentally. He’s still able to save the world, but he’s not always as spry on his feet.  A post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) on Mar 15, 2018 at 8:05am PDT  Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a high point in Tom Cruise’s career. Frankly, in the last decade-plus, he’s only had a handful of standout films; four of them have been entries in this franchise. (Edge of Tomorrow was also a lot of fun, an exception in his recent filmography.) Though Tom Cruise may not be ageless, his intensity works in his favor when playing Ethan Hunt. A seventh Mission: Impossible has not yet officially been greenlit, but one is expected to be in the works. If Cruise can keep figuring out how to make Ethan’s exploits as brilliantly entertaining as they are in this new entry, then it’s almost worth the stumbles in between.",0
"We often discuss French-girl style: Simple wardrobe basics and lived-in hair are at the center of that Parisian effortlessness. But how does it translate to handbags, one of the essential wardrobe accessories?  We tapped four French girls to weigh in on the bags we would never find in their closets and the ones they wear on repeat. It turns out that French girls aren't fans of oversize bags. When it comes to size, mini bags win out over larger styles. Those oversize shopper bags send the wrong message, they told us—French girls like to appear low-maintenance. On top of that, we also learned a few key rules. Stick to classic colors like navy or ones that can be found in nature such as terra-cotta and rust. Hues that are too bright or neon get skipped. Keep it simple. Anything that looks overworked with too many embellishments doesn't make the cut.  Go on to see what French girls have to say about the bags they love and the styles they'd never wear, and then shop their picks.",0

"Scheana Shay doesn’t even have to watch Vanderpump Rules to know how her relationship with now ex-boyfriend Rob Valletta has come off to fans.  “I will admit, I haven’t watched the last few episodes … last season, watching my divorce wasn’t as hard for me because I was in a very happy relationship, and I was madly in love with Rob,” Shay told costar and BFF Ariana Madix on the Tuesday, March 6, episode of her podcast, Scheananigans.  “Wait, you were?” Madix said sarcastically.  “I kept it super low-key,” Shay joked.  As previously reported, the SUR waitress filed for divorce from her husband of over two years, Mike Shay, in November 2016. She started dating Valletta shortly after, and viewers have been quick to criticize their relationship, calling Shay “pathetic” and “cringeworthy” on Twitter because she is seemingly more invested in their future than he is.  “Now I’m single, I’ve been single for six months now, watching back me being that happy, love drunk girl, started to get a little hard,” Shay explained. “Obviously, you can’t see every minute of every conversation … I know I look really stupid, and you know what? I was coming off a divorce. I got back with someone who I felt was my soulmate and was the one … You can’t fault me for being happy and being in love.”  “Rob was very reserved on the show,” she continued. “He is a person who lives his life on camera, acting and hosting, not for a reality show. For him, that was completely out of his comfort zone. He is a very private person … So for him, that was hard to have those raw emotions on there. The moments that we had in private are private moments. He did tell me he loved me. We were planning a future together, but then, just this world that he became a part of was too overwhelming for him to continue.”  Valletta defended Shay on February 26 after fans slammed their relationship: “No one knows what happens behind closed doors and or when the cameras are off. But what I do know is that there are things that I never expressed on camera, but did in person. The reason I created space in our relationship was because of the world, not the person. @scheana and I have cared for and supported each other for 12 years no matter the circumstances or dynamic. Leaving mean or nasty comments needs to stop!”  Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

"After his ultra-expensive Fyre Festival in the Bahamas turned into a disaster, Ja Rule issued an update via Twitter on Sunday, saying that all the guests who had traveled to the event are safe and can apply for refunds.

Our deepest apologies… #fyrefestival – Ja Rule (@Ruleyork) April 30, 2017  The Fyre Festival, for which weekend tickets were sold at prices ranging from $1,000-$12,000, was slated to include artists like Blink-182, Migos, and Major Lazer. Created by Ja Rule and entrepreneur Billy McFarland, the festival promised luxury living conditions and cuisine for attendees, with the most expensive ticket packages offering private tours and yacht rides.  Also Read: 5 More Charitable Ways Fyre Festival Attendees Could Have Spent Their $12,000  Instead, festival goers flooded the internet with pictures and stories of a half-finished festival site with poorly-constructed disaster relief tents, haphazard luggage handling, ham sandwiches served in take-out cartons, and staff that had been left in the dark with no instructions from festival organizers.  Shortly after guests arrived, Blink-182 cancelled, citing doubts they could provide “the quality of performances we always give fans.”  On Friday, Ja Rule posted a statement on social media saying that the festival was “not a scam” and that he was “heartbroken” at what had happened in the Bahamas.

In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.source “It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”source site Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.get link “So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”ikili opsiyon egitim “Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded.",1
"Scott Disick is arguably the greatest reality TV character to grace the screens of the E! network, so it's an outright tragedy that the man doesn't have his own Wikipedia entry. This isn't fan laziness, though; it's clear that at one point, Disick did have his own page, but it's since been deleted. Perhaps the man values his privacy or this is another example of Kris Jenner trying to control the family's branding.

We have fun, and you know, that’s it.”  DeMario Jackson and Corinne Olympios Photographer Group/Splash News  RELATED: Corinne Olympios Apologizes to DeMario Jackson over BiP Sex Scandal: “I’m Sorry You Had to Go Through This”  Despite the BiP sex scandal that rocked season 4’s production last summer, Jackson and Olympios remain close.  The pair has been spotted out and about multiple times over the past few months, sharing a friendly embrace in late August, leaving TAO restaurant in Hollywood in late September, and most recently celebrating Halloween together in Los Angeles.

"Rumors have been swirling about the reasons behind the breakup of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. And it has finally been revealed that the actual cause behind their recent split was that Selena decided to choose ‘happiness’ over Justin!  J-Beebs and Selena’s romance has been the most tumultuous one in the celebrity world. They broke up and got back together so many times that even the Jelena shippers have lost count.  Over the series of their breakups, both the stars handled their split very differently. And it’s a known fact that no matter who decides to break up, both the partners involved in a relationship feel terrible when things end between them. Having said that, one of the two always seems to be doing a little better than the other. And this time around, it seems as if Selena is trying to focus on the good instead of the bad.  A source close to the 25-year-old singer, Gomez, revealed to Us Weekly that she is ‘thrilled about her decision making process’.  While further elaborating, the source said, “Selena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship, like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends’ approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship.”  The source continued, “She obviously chose happiness and her friends and family, and is so thrill about her decision-making process. She feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.”  While talking about the Bad Liar singer’s sentiments on the same issue, the source said that Sel feels like she ‘got it out of her system’. And instead of ruminating over the breakup and holding on to the negative feelings, she has more ‘exciting’ things to look forward to – like her recent single, ‘Back 2 You’.  It has also been revealed by a source close to the family that the rift in the couple has majorly been caused due to Selena’s mother.  The source said, “Selena and Justin decided to take a break mainly because of Selena’s mom and her disapproval of Justin.”  “Justin’s family loves Selena, but Selena’s family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don’t trust Justin. Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed… but her family isn’t budging right now,” the insider concluded.  Justin and Selena’s breakup has started to look more like a permanent one, and reality has finally started to sink in with the Jelena fans!",1
"If you've been following the many ups and downs of the Selena Gomez/Justin Bieber relationship from the outside, you might be feeling the side effects of every twist and turn the relationship takes. So, you can only imagine what it feels like for the ""Come & Get It"" singer, who's experiencing it all with the whole world watching.  Gomez is opening up about her on-again, off-again (probably on-again) relationship with Bieber in the new issue of InStyle, describing it as ""crazy and very intense.""  She added, ""It's uncomfortable that everywhere I go, people know. I don't like that. But Justin and I never really focused on the attention. You can't help who you date. So I wouldn't swear off that or say that's what I want again. I don't know. I'm a kid, and a breakup is normal. I have to go through the emotions and feel it out. I'm doing my own thing, being with my friends, and he's doing very well too.""  But before they may have rekindled their romance, Gomez recorded ""Love Will Remember,"" for her 2013 album release. And, she confirms that the tune was inspired by her breakup with Bieber. She says in the issue, out May 17, ""That's the most personal track on the record, for sure. I think it's a sweet way of releasing it. It's not an aggressive approach to what people are probably expecting... I'm sure he'll love it too.""  For More On Selena In InStyle, Head Over To MTV Style!  The 20-year-old released her sensual new video for ""Come & Get It"" Tuesday night and sat down with MTV News to chat about her more mature image and how the Anthony Mandler-directed clip shows her artistic evolution.  ""It was fun for me to have a little more creative control over it,"" she said, adding she attributes her growth to Britney Spears in part. ""I think she's one of the best that made that transition. That video [""Slave 4 U""] is so hot, it's incredible, so I love that, and I definitely wanted to do that with my transition, but I don't think there's a path you have to follow. I think you just have to figure it out and hope for the best, so if it has a similarity, that's only a compliment.""",0
"Sienna who?  That's going to be the name of the game for Brad Pitt, newly single after close to two decades of slightly overlapping monogamy and—so the photographers hope—ready to mingle amid his divorce from Angelina Jolie.  And by all accounts, Pitt is readyish to mingle. Back in April he was reportedly ""dating a bit."" A source told E! News that he wasn't dating just yet but was going ""out with friends.""  Also in April, an insider denied that Pitt was engaging in some ""serious flirting"" with Sienna Millerduring a group dinner following the Hollywood premiere of her latest movie, The Lost Season of Z, which counts Pitt's Plan B Entertainment as a producer.

"Quincy Jones has been awarded $9.42 million ($9,423,695) after a trial that ended with a Los Angeles jury finding in the producer’s favor in a royalties dispute with Michael Jackson’s estate, Variety reports.  The lawsuit, which Jones filed in 2013, stemmed from Jones’ claim that he was owed royalties for a series of projects that were released after Jackson died, including the music used in two Cirque du Soleil productions and music featured in the This Is It concert film. Jones said he was owed $30 million.  Last week, Jones took the witness stand and claimed he was “cheated out of a lot of money” by the Jackson estate.  During the two-week trial, lawyers debated over interpreting the contract language that determined how Jones’ royalties should be computed, particularly the contracts from Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad. Attorneys for Jones argued that those contracts entitled Jones to royalties from the posthumous This is It along with proceeds from the two Cirque du Soleil shows. Meanwhile, Howard Weitzman, who represented the Jackson estate, argued that Jackson made the major contributions to the sound of each song.  “While the jury denied Quincy Jones $21 million – or more than two-thirds of what he demanded — from The Estate of Michael Jackson, we still believe that giving him millions of dollars that he has no right to receive under his contracts is wrong,” Weitzman and Zia Modabber, attorneys for The Estate of Michael Jackson, said in a statement. “This would reinterpret the legal language in, and effectively rewrite, contracts that Mr. Jones lived under for more than three decades, admitted he never read, referred to as ‘contract, montract,’ and told the jurors he didn’t ‘give a damn’ about. Any amount above and beyond what is called for in his contracts is too much and unfair to Michael’s heirs. Although Mr. Jones is portraying this is a victory for artists’ rights, the real artist is Michael Jackson and it is his money Mr. Jones is seeking.”  Following the verdict, Jones said in a statement via Variety, “As an artist, maintaining the vision and integrity of one’s creation is of paramount importance. I, along with the team I assembled with Michael, took great care and purpose in creating these albums, and it has always given me a great sense of pride and comfort that three decades after they were originally recorded, these songs are still being played in every corner of the world.  “This lawsuit was never about Michael, it was about protecting the integrity of the work we all did in the recording studio and the legacy of what we created,” he continued. ” Although this judgement is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favor in this matter. I view it not only as a victory for myself personally, but for artists’ rights overall.”",0
"This week, Kanye West has caused controversy across the globe thanks to his erratic and bizarre Tweets - including supporting US President Donald Trump and claims that slavery was a 'choice.'  The 40-year-old rapper called himself the 'future president', bragged about his 'dragon energy' and announced he had fired his management because he 'can't be managed.' Wife Kim Kardashian was quick to jump to his defense, tweeting to her fans it was unfair to label her husband 'mentally ill' because he has always been 'expressive.'  In 2016, Kanye spent time in a psychiatric facility due to a mental breakdown.  Now, Life & Style has explosively claimed today that the rapper's problems are more serious than ever, with insiders claiming they've led to the disintegration of his four year marriage.  'Kim is in talks with lawyers about getting a divorce,' a friend close to Kim told Life & Style. 'Kanye's acting more unpredictable than ever.

"Katy Perry has a message to all those people who keep taking to social media and telling her they liked her long, dark tresses and frothy pop-star persona more than her new cropped ‘do and harder-edged image: get over it.  Thanks to the enormous success of her Teenage Dream album, millions of fans throughout the world embraced an image of Perry as a bubbly, larger-than-life pop star, and her recent efforts to present a more realistic, intimate version of herself has met with resistance in some quarters.  WATCH BELOW: The Evolution Of Katy Perry  Yet as Perry details in a new profile in the New York Times, the “old” Perry was the real her — and so is this new version.  “I didn’t kill her, because I love her, and she is exactly what I had to do then,” Perry says of the persona she took on during her hugely successful Teenage Dream period. “And I’m not a con artist, I didn’t con people, like, that was just me. And this is me now.”  RELATED: Katy Perry rates her lovers during livestream and Diplo responds to being in last place  Perry looks back at that period in her life as “**king intense. And amazing and beautiful and horrible all at the same time,” pointing out that Perry now, she explains, is simply the result of her own personal evolution over the years.  That evolution, she says, is constant and ongoing. “Every day when I think I know something, the universe shows me that I need to learn another lesson,” she says. “So I stand here today, more so than any other day, saying I know nothing. I literally know nothing.”  Yet reacting to the constant stream of social media criticism, she says, can be a “maddening game,” adding: “They want you to stand for something, but once you do, and if you don’t do it perfectly, they’re ready to take you right down.”  RELATED: Katy Perry changes Taylor Swift ‘Swish Swish’ lyric, tears her pants during livestream concert  She describes her new album, Witness, as being perfectly reflective of where she’s at now. “It’s a departure, and it’s a necessary evolution that I have to take,” she says of her new direction.  “And I know that sometimes it feels publicly like I’m dragging cement blocks, but like, the pyramids were made out of cement blocks — or not cement,” she adds. “But do you know what I’m trying to say? I’m gonna get there.”",0
"Mariah Carey and Joe Jonas are NOT feuding, nor did she refuse to stand next to him as the ball dropped in Times Square on New Year’s Eve, despite a manufactured report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We’re told it’s “not true.”  “The Mariah-Joe Jonas Hate Fest Rolls On,” reads a headline in this week’s National Enquirer, which claims Carey “refused” to stand next to Jonas and his band in Times Square as the ball dropped on New Year’s Eve. A so-called “source” tells the tabloid, “Now Joe doesn’t want anything to do with Mariah or even be at the same events.”  Let Gossip Cop set the record straight. A rep for Carey exclusively assures us the report is 100 percent “not true.” The pair, who both performed in New York’s Times Square on New Year’s Eve, the busiest night of the year, weren’t standing anywhere near each other because there were roughly around 1 million people in between them.

"Activists have often turned to fashion to heighten moments of protest. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January, women flooded Washington wearing pink pussycat hats to march on the Capitol. In September, celebrities made a political statement at the 2017 Emmys by wearing blue ACLU ribbons after Trump announced his plans to end DACA.  But perhaps this year’s Golden Globes could thread Hollywood’s largest display of solidarity as some of the biggest names in show business pledge to don black at the 75th annual event.  With the influx of sexual misconduct allegations in entertainment — and other industries — since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke in October, stars of the big and small screen are planning to wear all black to the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles this Sunday in support of those who have spoken out about sexual harassment and to protest gender inequality.  Along with the dark ensembles, participants will reportedly be accessorizing with pins created by Time’s Up — the coalition behind the statement.  CREDIT: Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock  Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and 300 other prominent women in the entertainment industry are behind the Time’s Up initiative aimed at eradicating abuse, harassment, marginalization and underrepresentation in the work place.  Related Natalie Portman Speaks Out on 'Pervasive' Abuse in Hollywood Kerry Washington, Time's Up Leaders Among Investors in The Wing, a Women's Workspace Startup  The alliance almost decided to boycott the Golden Globe Awards entirely, Kerry Washington told the LA Times. But the group eventually decided against it, suggesting that it was important to support their peers who were nominated.  Instead, an agreement was made to wear all black, with the hopes that this unified stand would prompt a larger discussion from the red carpet, leveraging the access to millions of viewers tuned in to watch the awards show, both on camera and online, with the hashtag #WhyWeWearBlack.  “Wearing black is an opportunity to talk about all the other things that we’re doing,” Washington explained to the Times. “We’re saying that we are three-dimensional, fully realized human beings as women. We are participants in this entertainment industry, and we have something to say.”  Despite the all-black attire creating a seemingly similar aesthetic, Cristina Ehrlich, whose clients include Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Greta Gerwig, Laura Dern, Alison Brie, Allison Williams, and Tina Fey, said her clients will still be telling a unique story through fashion.  “People aren’t using words anymore like, ‘I want to look sexy.’ It’s more about, ‘I want to look like I’m a woman of power. I want to look like a woman who is standing my ground,'” Ehrlich told Variety earlier this week.  Several women have even requested to wear female designers, she added.  “Because [the Globes] is international and it’s the Hollywood Foreign Press, you really want these women to have a moment that is going to strike as many different audiences as you can,” she said.  Stylist Ilaria Urbanati, who works with Dwayne Johnson, Tom Hiddleston, and Armie Hammer, posted about the protest on Instagram in December and confirmed her male clients will be wearing black in unity with women.  “Safe to say this may not be the right time to choose to be the odd man out here,” she wrote.  To the critics who argued that #WhyWeWearBlack wouldn’t be an effective demonstration, actress Rashida Jones says they’re missing the point entirely.  “This is not a silent protest,” the actress told InStyle. “We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time’s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in. It’s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.” Online, fellow actors Ashley Judd and Tessa Thompson tweeted their support of Jones’ statements.  Viewers will get to see that online solidarity in action on the red carpet Sunday night.",0

"Melissa Etheridge — a passionate advocate for medical marijuana — was busted for drug possession in August.  The 56-year-old singer was returning to the United States from Canada in North Dakota when her tour bus was reportedly stopped by Customs and Border Patrol. After drug-sniffing dogs detected the substance, agents discovered marijuana oil, according to TMZ.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Etheridge told police that she uses the drug to manage pain from cancer. Although the drug is legal in California, however, it’s not allowed in North Dakota, said TMZ.  The “Come to My Window” crooner was reportedly booked for possession of a controlled substance and smiled from ear-to-ear in her mugshot, which was obtained by TMZ. According to the outlet, she pleaded not guilty. PEOPLE’s requests for comment were not immediately returned by CBP or a rep for Etheridge.  Etheridge first opened up about her weed use in the new Yahoo! project Cannabis & the American Family, and PEOPLE premiered the video clip earlier this year. The Grammy-winner explained that she began using medical marijuana as a holistic alternative to pharmaceuticals when she was undergoing chemotherapy after her 2004 breast cancer diagnosis.  During the initial interview, she added that she has smoked with her wife, Linda Wallem, and two older kids: Bailey, 20, and Beckett, 18. “It’s a very natural, end-of-the-day [thing],” she told Yahoo! “And it brings you much closer. I’d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink — oh, God, no.”  Since her quotes made the rounds online, Etheridge said she’s received flak for her parenting style and would hope the attention would be directed to a more important issue.  RELATED VIDEO: Melissa Etheridge’s Music Room Is the Coolest  Etheridge later clarified her comments exclusively to PEOPLE.  “I’ve been a celebrity here for almost 30 years, and I’ve done my best to speak truthfully about who I am and my human experience as I go through life, from my work to my family,” the rocker said. “Sometimes I find that I can say something, thinking that the whole world will understand, and they kind of go in another direction. I think if I get a little more specific, it can help guide the conversation in general about cannabis.”  Etheridge discussed why she believes her use of cannabis with her children has been “demonized” — and opened up about how heartbroken she was over the backlash she received for smoking with her kids.  “My children are my priority,” said Etheridge, who is also mom to 10-year-old twin daughters Johnnie Rose and Miller Steven. “I love my children. They are four of the most amazing human beings on earth. I live a very blessed life. I would never want to harm any of them.”",0
"Justin Theroux and Emma Stone‘s romance is heating up RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively, much to the heartbreak of Jennifer Aniston.  “They’re holding back on going totally public just yet, until the terms of Justin’s split have been fully worked out. But they’re totally dating under the radar, and everyone knows including Jen who’s predictably fuming,” snitched a source.  Theroux, 46, and Stone, 29, were recently spotted together in France, where they attended Louis Vuitton’s fashion show. Though they sat apart on the A-lister filled front row, they were soon caught canoodling at the ritzy after party.  A source told Radar exclusively that while the pair did their best to look friendly at the Hotel in Cap-d’antibes bash in Antibes, France, they couldn’t keep their hands off each other.  “[Aniston] considered Emma as a good friend before all this, so it’s totally sideswiped her; even though Justin’s shameless networking deep inside her social circle has been going on a while.  Theroux was first caught with Stone when he posted a photo of himself hanging out with her in April, just weeks after his split from Aniston!  “If anything it’s given Jen a harsh reality that many if not most of her showbiz pals are superficial as hell.”",1

News she’s thrilled her ex-boyfriend found love with Nikki Reed. (The couple tied the knot April 26 in Malibu, California.)  “When I heard about the wedding, I thought it was beautiful.

The rapper recently sat down with Vulture to talk about his new album Revival, but he also opened up about his love life. Em's been single for a while now, and it turns out that he's turned to the internet for a quicker, easier way to meet new people.  ""It's tough. Since my divorce I've had a few dates and nothing's panned out in a way that I wanted to make it public,"" he said. ""Dating's just not where I'm at lately.""  When asked if he uses dating apps to meet people, the rapper admitted to using Tinder.  ""And Grindr,"" he said, adding, ""I also used to go to strip clubs. What can I say? Going to strip clubs is how I was meeting some chicks. It was an interesting time for me.""  Whatever works, right?

"Angelina Jolie spent a good decade transforming her image from a wild child who wore vials of blood around her neck to a latter-day Mother Teresa, ministering to refugees and war-zone orphans. But St. Angie’s halo has well and truly slipped.  “It doesn’t matter how much charity work you do,” said a source with knowledge of the Jolie-Pitt family. “If you drive a wedge between a father and his children, you’re an a–hole.”  Over the past few weeks, Jolie, 43, and her lawyers have claimed that Pitt, 54, has failed to pay any “significant” support for their six children. (Pitt’s camp insists that the actor has paid out $9.3 million since the couple’s 2016 split.) Jolie has, as a Hollywood source close to the Jolie-Pitts told The Post, tried to paint her ex as a “deadbeat dad” and created a rift between the actor and his kids.  In court documents, Pitt’s lawyers called out Jolie and her lawyers for filing papers that are “calculated to increase the conflict” and are a “thinly veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.”  Just this month, she was playing mind games. Around August 1, Pitt asked Jolie, through lawyers, to end the marriage as soon as possible, even before the high-profile couple has worked out a custody schedule and financial agreement.  Through her team, Jolie asked her ex to wait a week to consider his request — then filed her own motion, requesting the exact same thing.  “Angelina filed with the judge to make it look like she wanted the early ­divorce before Brad [did],” said Los Angeles divorce attorney Peter Walzer, who has cases up against one of Jolie’s lawyers, Laura Wasser.  Some say it’s an act of revenge by Jolie, who was, of course, the first to make the public strike in the split.  “She doesn’t want Brad to move on,” said the family source.  “She’s furious that he’s not chasing after her — and [that fury is] now ruining her image.”  Jolie’s latest round of fire also comes this month when she hired two new attorneys — Hollywood bigwig Joseph Mannis, who has represented celebrities Halle Berry and Dennis Hopper in contentious family cases — and San Francisco-based Samantha Bley DeJean.  They join Wasser, who, according to the family source, advised the star not to go nuclear on Pitt.  “I think Angelina thought, ‘I don’t like where this is going, let’s get tough,’ ” Walzer said of the actress’ decision to bring in more hired guns. “Several things have happened that have caused [her] to say ‘I better . . . hire some lawyers in who are going to be aggressive.’ ”  The Hollywood source said Jolie was also provoked to wage war by two of her friends: Lady Arminka Helic, a Bosnian foreign-policy expert and a member of the UK House of Lords; and Chloe Dalton, who worked as former UK Foreign Secretary William Hague’s speechwriter.  The trio all met through Hague, who a close confidant of Jolie’s, and with whom she set up a sexual-violence-prevention initiative for women in Bangladesh.  “They played a big role in all of this, telling Angelina, ‘You’re the greatest’ ” the Hollywood source said of the friends.  Part of Jolie’s strategy to protect her own persona, insiders say, has been to publicly shame Pitt since they announced their divorce in September 2016.  “She filed for divorce out of the blue, then people connected to her floated information to the media that [Pitt] had punched one of their kids on a flight in a drunken, high rage,” said the family source. According to TMZ, Jolie told a social worker that Pitt had struck their son Maddox, then 15, on a private jet.  The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services investigated and cleared Pitt of the child-abuse allegations. In November 2016, Pitt was also cleared by the FBI of any wrong­doing.  see also Don’t ask Angelina Jolie about Brad Pitt When ABC’s Juju Chang raised the subject of Jolie’s divorce...  The family source added, “Angelina kicked the s–t out of Brad at the beginning. Then she tried to make other threats and said he was going to be ­arrested. She really started a whispering campaign against Brad that was ­demonstrably false.”  Jolie was further left fuming, according to the Hollywood source, when her ex was given a standing ovation by the audience at the January 2017 Golden Globes after months out of the spotlight.  “Angelina went crazy. That’s why she insisted on releasing a joint statement two days later,” added the Hollywood source. “She was trying to attach herself to him, so people wouldn’t view her ­unfavorably.”  In the joint statement, released on January 10, 2017, Jolie and Pitt said they were hiring a private judge and would handle their divorce in a private forum, while working to reunify their family.  But then, the family source said, “Angelina believed the only way to win was to go in for the kill.” Jolie’s team publicly leaked court documents, alongside a statement about a lack of child support, to NBC News earlier this month.  “She went on the attack,” the family source said. “Essentially, Angelina’s calling Brad a deadbeat dad, when he pays for the kids’ security, hotels and private jets. All he wants is to see his kids.”  Insiders also told The Post that Jolie has made that difficult.  “In the past two years, Angelina has driven a wedge between [Pitt] and the kids, from controlling [their] phone calls to telling the kids they don’t need to see him and picking times he can see them when she knows he’s working,” said a source with intimate knowledge of the divorce.  In June, Judge John Ouderkirk (who also presided over the couple’s August 2015 civil wedding ceremony) told Jolie that if the children “remain closed down to their father,” she faced losing custody of them.  The actress was ordered to give Pitt the numbers for all the kids’ phones, as well as to refrain from monitoring any conversations between him and the children.  Currently, Pitt gets visitation with Maddox, 17, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12 and twins Vivienne and Knox, 10, for four hours every other day and 12 hours over the weekend. There is one exception: The court is allowing Maddox to decide how much time he spends with his father.  On Wednesday, news leaked that Jolie and Pitt had come to terms on an interim custody agreement. However, a source close to Pitt said that the couple have the same interim agreement that has been in place for a while, with a more permanent custody deal still to be decided.  “There was no new agreement. This was totally made up,” the source said. “The biggest joke is that she continues to be awful toward him.”  “Angie has these wild mood swings,” the source added. “She [had] launched this aggressive tone, which backfired, saying she’s poor when she’s making $25 million a movie, and saying Brad’s not paid child support. This week, she came back all mellow and super nice — it’s a direct reaction to the fact that people did not react well to her [previous] blow.”  (Jolie’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.)  As for financial support, Pitt’s lawyers have reiterated that he loaned Jolie $8 million so she could buy a $19 million home — the estate of legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille — and has paid out more than $1.3 million in child ­support.  For Pitt, said the Hollywood source, “It’s really the alienation from his kids that’s the worst.”  Walzer said Jolie needs to be careful about her behavior ahead of a custody hearing, which will be followed by family visits with a court-appointed psychologist.  “When somebody is in the throes of this kind of custody proceeding, they’re not always rational,” he explained. “If you look uncooperative, it could be worse for you. If you look like you’re the alienating parent, then you’re putting yourself at risk — do you really want to do that?”  And then there’s Jolie’s public reputation.  This is certainly not the first time Jolie has puppeteered her image and the lives of those around her.  She became truly famous, after years of under-the-radar movie roles, when she stole the show in the 1999 movie “Girl, Interrupted.” At that point, Jolie was Hollywood’s ultimate bad girl. She dressed in witchy black, was using drugs (as she would admit to years later) — including ­going to Disneyland while on acid — and shocked the world when she shared an uncomfortably intimate kiss with her brother James at the 2000 Oscars, where she won Best Supporting Actress.  That year, she married Billy Bob Thornton — who allegedly dumped fiancée Laura Dern to be with her — and took her reputation into overdrive when the two hit the red carpet wearing vials of each other’s blood.  But by 2003, the couple had split and she was ready to reinvent. She became a mom on her own to a son, Maddox, adopted from Cambodia. Hooking up with Pitt in 2004 on the set of “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” she was seen as the vixen who stole the man of America’s sweetheart, Jennifer Aniston.  There was nowhere to go but up. So the transformation to St. Angie kicked into high gear as she adopted more children and pursued an interest in human rights.  “Angelina did one of the greatest jobs ever in developing a new persona ,” said the Hollywood source.  One step at a time, Jolie showed her softer side. The couple was seen taking their multiracial brood of six around the world. Jolie became a special envoy to the United Nations. And she publicly, and poignantly, spoke of her mother’s death from ovarian cancer and her own decision to have a double mastectomy and surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes after discovering she tested positive for the BRCA1 gene.  “Angie was controlling her own narrative,” said the Hollywood source. “She was a role model — there was a relatability about her and her health issues. She did a great job to combine all of these things.”  But, it seems, Jolie may have finally lost control.  “Ultimately, she almost got too comfortable [acting as a role model],” added the Hollywood source. “She wasn’t able to adapt to some of the realities of her marriage and her life.  “She just assumed that people would follow whatever she said, including her husband, and so when they had marital issues, she . . . believed she could just bully him into whatever she wanted.”  After her marriage to Pitt came apart, ­Jolie employed a master stroke of public relations — breaking her silence on the split while in Cambodia promoting a movie she had directed, “First They Killed My ­Father.”  Looking upset, she told the BBC in February this year it had been a “very difficult time . . . We are a family and we will always be a family, and we will get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.”  However, the Jolie insider said, the actress was beset by old demons. “You can try to change as much as you want, but you’re always going to go back to who you truly are. She can’t help herself.”  According to Page Six, Jolie is also fuming that she has been usurped as the world’s most glamorous humanitarian by Amal Clooney, the stylish human-rights lawyer who is married to George Clooney.  “Angelina hates all the attention that Amal is getting,” said a Jolie insider. The brunette reportedly feels Amal has pulled a “single white female” and stolen her identity. The insider added: “Angie can’t understand why she herself has become so ­unpopular in Hollywood.”  For his part, Pitt has given only one interview since the split, to GQ in May 2017, in which he detailed how he had given up the alcohol and marijuana that he had used as “a crutch.”  He spoke of his fears for his children and said: “It is a drag to have certain things drug out in public and misconstrued. I worry about it more for my kids, being subjected to it and their friends getting ideas from it.”  This, said the Hollywood source, is why he just wants to finalize things as quietly and peacefully as possible. “He’s not having the best time, but he’s hanging in there. He’s hopeful this will all be resolved.”  But Hollywood’s former golden couple is now reduced to barely speaking to each other, added the Hollywood source. “They talk some, but [not] very much. Once you go down this road, and s–t gets flung about, then it’s very difficult.”",1
"They can no longer even pretend to make it work. For years, it’s been rumored that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have had troubles in their marriage — but an insider tells In Touch exclusively that the pair, who have been married since 2008, are officially at their breaking point, and divorce is officially inevitable.  “They’re not going to make it. Their roller-coaster marriage is about to derail,” the insider tells the magazine.  The reason they have held off until this point isn’t a coincidence: Next August marks 10 years since they tied the knot, and after making it a decade together, California law could mean Portia is entitled to more of Ellen’s money (Ellen is worth an estimated $360 million, compared to Portia’s $20 million fortune). Should Ellen want to protect herself (and her estate), she would need to end their union before the big anniversary come August. But it’s unlikely that that’ll happen — as Ellen was the one hoping to make things work. The insider adds, “[Ellen’s] friends know she would do whatever it takes to stay married to Portia, and she has. They’ve gone to individual and couples counseling.”  Of course, it isn’t surprising that Ellen, 59, isn’t as keen to divorce as her wife, 44; according to the insider, her controllng ways played a huge role in their crumbling relationship. “Ellen is a control freak, and she prety much micromanages Portia’s personal and professional life,” the insider explains, adding that Portia is far from innocent. “Ellen is tired of being told to change this and change that about herself. It’s a sad situation. Ellen doesn’t want to get a divorce. She’s a romantic.”  With the potential trouble looming around the “10-year rule,” as it’s known informally in California, the legal battle looming ahead is likely to be an ugly one. And the personal battle will be just as ugly for their loved ones and fans. The insider laments, “No one wants to see them split up.”  For more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch — and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter!

"The Kardashians have awoken many feelings in their viewers, with one of those feelings being envy. It is sometimes irresistible to not envy them. I mean, come on!! Their jobs seem pretty easy, they get paid millions of dollars, travel all around the world, dress to the nines, look gorgeous all the time and have a close knit family.  It seems like they have it all right? Well… that is for you to decide. The reality of things is that even if they became famous for doing reality TV, everything that we see on the screen is not real at all.  Read this list and realize just whose life you would rather have. You might realize how amazing your life is and why you wouldn’t change it for the world.  advertising  14 They will never have a 'normal' life again  via:youtube.com  This family is so famous they will probably never have normal lives again. They are Michael Jackson famous, if anything they are harassed more than he was. They can't even leave their homes without needing to look flawless as the paparazzi are always waiting to catch their every move. Wouldn't you go crazy?  13 Their Beauty is Not As Real As It Seems  via:www.thekyliejenner.com  advertising  They make money out of their beauty, it is one of their most important assets, along with their bums. That is why it's no surprise that they have to invest millions of dollars in looking absolutely perfect every day.  It’s been reported by the Daily Mail that Kim Kardashian spends over $130,000 dollars a year on beauty treatments alone. With that amount of cash anyone would look flawless.  So next time you envy her beauty just think she pays a very high price tag to look that way.  12 Pressure to be Beautiful  Via: Youtube.com  Women around the world feel this constant pressure as well, but can you imagine how stressful it must be when your income depends on it and you have millions of eyes on you?  Kylie Jenner is one of the main examples of the pressure that can lead to an already beautiful girl to get a cosmetic procedure to look a certain way. She was not even 18 years old when she got her lips pumped to (I’m assuming) look like her older sisters, whose looks are reported as “beautiful” thanks to all of that cash they spend on it.  Pretty ironic isn’t it? That the older Kardashians negatively influenced their younger sibling into getting cosmetic procedures to looks like them.  11 Stolen Childhoods  via:www.yournextshoes.com  advertising  Kylie and Kendal have spent nearly half their lives recorded by the cameras for the world to see. They’ve had to deal with very personal issues and have cameras record their every reaction, limiting their privacy.  Teenage years are very difficult for most human beings; it is a difficult stage that involves a lot of changes and behavior that many of us wish to forget. These young girls have the entire world watching their every move, their lives, the failures and successes and it’s all being recorded for the world to remember.  The last years of their childhood was spent with other people around their house just recording everything, with their sisters putting on a show. Can you imagine what this can do to the mind of a child?  Kylie and Kendal don’t deserve our envy. They deserve our compassion.  10 The Kardashians Have Suffered Great Pain  via:www.dailymail.co.uk  They’re humans with lives that have not been all perfect and they still smile, laugh and go on. They seem so happy most of the time and that’s actually something nice to see given that they’ve also had to deal with very painful events in their lives.  Their marriages and relationships have been ridiculed, especially Kim's 72 hour marriage to Kris Humphries. Khloe has the whole world giving opinions on her marriage and Kourtney is dealing with a very public breakup.  9 They Have to Deal With a Lot of Humiliation  via:radaronline.com  advertising  To us the Kardashians might seem powerful; they are after all celebrities with millions of fans. Nevertheless in the celebrity world there are certain “categories”, do not be fooled by their millions of fans.  Within the Hollywood celebrity world the Kardashians are far away from being a part of the exclusive A list. They have actually been heavily criticize by BIG names in the entertainment industry like Jon Hamm, Daniel Craig, Michael Buble, Mariah Carey, Cher, Reese Witherspoon and even Barak and Michelle Obama.  They are considered too trashy, fame obsessed and foolish. Barack Obama doesn’t even like it when his daughters watch their show.  8 Their Fame is a Result of a Scandalous Sex Tape  via:darkhorsenews.com  It’s no surprise to anyone that the Kardashians/Jenners owe their fame to Kim’s scandalous sex tape. As Barbara Walter said in an interview with the Kardashians “You don’t act, you don’t sing, you don’t dance. You don’t have…. Forgive me, any talents”.  Their fame came mainly as a product of Kim’s sex tape and Kris Jenner’s excellent capacity for marketing it to their advantage. If it wasn’t for that, it’s very, extremely unlikely we would know their names today.  advertising  7 Kylie and Kendal Went Through their Dad’s Gender Transition  advertising  We all love Caitlin, there’s no doubt about that. The world felt proud when Bruce was brave enough to go through the public transition of becoming Caitlyn.  Nevertheless for Kylie and Kendal it was a pretty big emotional trauma. It was, after all, saying goodbye to their father Bruce and saying hello to Caitlyn.  Anyone in the world would find this emotionally difficult, and to make matters worse Kylie and Kendal had to go through it in the public eye. In several chapters of Keeping Up With The Kardashians you can easily notice a troubled Kylie finding it hard to come to terms to her father’s decision.  6 They Live Superficial Lifestyles  via:www.eonline.com  According to Psychology Today, leading a materialistic and superficial life style can enhance the probability of developing depression.  It is the lack of spiritual and emotional fulfillment that can help create mental health issues, especially when narcissism is involved in the formula.  As we can see the Kardashian/Jenners expose every detail of their lives. Not only on their reality T.V. show but also on their social media, perfectly yet falsely portraying themselves in their best snapshots. These symptoms are categorized as symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder, which can lead to emotional trauma.  5 They’re Self Obsessed  via:www.thedailybeast.com  advertising  What the world needs is more empathetic human beings who are concerned about the well being of others, not people who are only concerned about themselves.  The Kardashians have famously portrayed themselves as self obsessed with their millions of selfies, which have led their younger sisters, Kylie and Kendal to follow the same footpath.  Being self obsessed can actually cause health problems, just like His Holiness the Dalai Lama says: People who have the tendency to use more self-referential terms (I, me, myself) tend to have more health problems and earlier deaths. Being self-absorbed has an immediate effect of narrowing one’s focus and blurring one’s vision.”  4 Their Father is Known to Have Played Devil’s Advocate  Via: Mirror.co.uk  Everyone wants to admire their father for great qualities and for being a good person. Unfortunately for the Kardashians, their dad is known to have played devil’s advocate by famously defending O.J. Simpson in his murder trial after killing his wife Nicole Brown.  O.J. Simpson’s case became famous because the world was certain that he got away with murder, thanks to his magnificent attorney Robert Kardashian.  Yes, their father was a very successful lawyer, but one with values that leaves many wondering about his integrity.  3 Their Mother Has a Questionable History  via:www.dailymail.co.uk  advertising  Kris Jenner had an affair with Todd Waterman while still being married to Robert Kardashian. It has also been reported that she would leave her children at home while she enjoyed the good life.  It can't be pleasing to know that your mother cared more about her lover than her children. Rob Kardashian Jr. was just a baby when his mother would run off at night to have fun.  If this where not enough, in Robert Kardashian’s diary it was reported that Kris Jenner would beat up Kim Kardashian when she was a young teenager and she would also come home drunk.  2 They Fight A Lot  via:www.youtube.com  It’s normal to fight with your siblings. Nevertheless to anyone who has ever watched the show they’d be very accustomed to always seeing them fight. Even over the simplest and most foolish things of all, like when Kim fought with her mother over an apartment in New York.  Instead of feeling grateful and happy to have such a marvelous life style they focus on the little things to make a drama over anything. It kind of makes us wonder, are they even happy?  1 They Are Very Much Hated  via:www.youtube.com  advertising  The Kardashians are those people we all love to hate. They might have millions of followers and fans, but these people are probably smaller in quantity than the haters. It doesn’t take long to scroll down the comments section on stories about them and read many negative comments about them.  They’ve had to grow a very thick skin to put up with a lot of the criticism that gets thrown their way. They are not like other celebrities who tend to have more fans than haters. Kim Kardashian in particular has appeared in several lists as one of the most hated people in the entertainment industry.  Ouch! No one would like to be on that list.

He said in Details, ""There were all these beautiful, beautiful dancers. As a straight guy I had some room. There were the shared interests in singing and dancing, and I always find dancing with someone very erotic and sexual. I definitely hooked up with a lot of girls when I was a young guy on Broadway.""[6]  Career [ edit ]  Morrison's career began when he made his musical theatre debut on Broadway in the musical version of Footloose, followed by a revival of The Rocky Horror Show in 2002.

Getty  Life & Style reports that the days leading up to Jen's 49th birthday on February 11 was when the couple's relationship came crumbling down.  The publication claims to have exclusively learned that Jen feared Justin intended to break up with her on her big day, with a source revealing: 'He'd arranged to throw Jen a small, intimate party and hang around for a few days before heading right back to New York.

"CLOSE Emma Stone stars as Billie Jean King and Steve Carell is Bobby Riggs in the 1970s-set sports film 'Battle of the Sexes.' Fox Searchlight  It took more than Hollywood magic to turn Emma Stone, the svelte actress from La La Land, into Billie Jean King in her new movie Battle of the Sexes.  For starters, the physical transformation required three months, 15 pounds and a meal and fitness plan.  Trainer Jason Walsh, founder of climbing gym Rise Nation, who got Stone in shape for La La Land, knew the actress would need to up her calorie intake and strength training regimen to embody the powerful tennis legend.  Here's what Stone went through to reshape her body.  For her role in 'Battle of the Sexes,' Emma Stone gained 15 pounds. (Photo: Melinda Sue Gordon, 20th Century Fox Film)  She wasn’t afraid of packing on pounds.  Stone is “very petite and has a dancer's body,” but she was willing to bulk up to look more like King. “She took it seriously,"" Walsh says. ""She wanted to do the story justice.”  Gaining a dozen-plus pounds of muscle made Stone look more like a tennis pro, and also feel more like her character. “We wanted to give Emma the psychological backing” to be able to compete in professional tennis matches, Walsh says. “She needed to be resilient and to have the psyche of being really strong.”  Emma Stone, here with co-star Ryan Gosling, had a lithe look for 'La La Land.' (Photo: Dale Robinette)  She drank two high-cal protein shakes a day.  “It wasn’t like we were taking someone off the Taco Bell diet,” Walsh says of his clean-eating client, “but we added shakes into her diet."" The shakes had “hundreds of calories” each, he says, and usually contained a handful of spinach, a supplement known as ashwagandha and a “good tasting"" protein powder. Fortunately, since Stone was working out so much (twice a day), she was hungry enough to down the filling beverages.  Emma Stone getting her deadlift on. Ladies, DEADLIFT!!!! This lift will change your life. #Strongisthenewsexy #strong #motivated A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 21, 2015 at 7:54am PDT  She lifted an impressive amount of weight.  Some of Walsh’s daily go-to strength training exercises for Stone? Pushing and pulling sleds twice her size, heavy farmer’s walks (aka walking while holding dumbbells) and up to 300-pound hip thrusts. At one point, Stone was deadlifting 185 pounds and doing push-ups with 50 pounds of chains on her back.  “I was pretty proud,” Walsh says.  The ""Battle of the Sexes"" Working with Emma is pure hell...we loathe each other #battleofthesexes #emmastone A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 22, 2017 at 6:34pm PDT  Then she backed off.  While Stone was gaining weight, she stayed away from fat-burning cardio. But once she achieved the right look for the film, “we started adding conditioning aspects,” Walsh says. That meant Stone was lifting fewer weights and doing cardio at Rise Nation once or twice a week.  She's two years beyond her most intensive Battle of the Sexes training, but Walsh encourages the actress, and anyone else trying to stay in shape, to mix activities like yoga and hiking with strength training.  Yes, for women. And, yes, that means lifting weights.  “I train (GLOW star) Alison Brie and (future Captain Marvel) Brie Larson, and all of these girls are strong as hell and not big,” he says. In fact, after incorporating weight-lifting into their workout routine, “They fit into their clothes better (and) are three, four, five times stronger than before.”  Want to see the results of Stone's hard work? Battle of the Sexes is in theaters now in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, San Francisco and Washington. It expands nationwide Friday.  Emma Stone, with co-star Steve Carrell, looked and felt very strong playing real-life tennis legend Billie Jean King.

"Shakira Kicks Off Momentous U.S. Tour in Chicago After 7-Year Wait: 'I've Been Dreaming About This Moment'  Shakira kicks off the North American leg of Her El Dorado World Tour at United Center on Aug. 3, 2018 in Chicago.  Shakira fans waited long enough to see the Colombian superstar touring and back onstage in the United States -- seven years to be exact. And for some fans, like Joel and Karen, it was the first time they got to see Shakira live.  “We drove eight hours from Minnesota just to see her,” said the couple. “We’ve been waiting since the '90s to see Shakira. I want to sing the oldies with her."" ""I’ve been practicing in my shower for the last 20 years,” added Karen.  After a successful run in Europe earlier this summer, Shakira kicked off the U.S. leg of her El Dorado Tour at the United Center in Chicago on Friday (Aug. 3). The tour was rescheduled from January after the singer/songwriter had to postpone her international trek due to strained vocal chords.  “It’s so good to see you,” Shakira said after singing her first couple of songs, including “Estoy Aquí,” “She Wolf” and “Si Te Vas.”  “It’s been way too long,"" she continued. ""I’ve been dreaming about this moment. There were times when all of this seemed impossible, but miracles do exist. You made this happen! Thank you for all your support, especially in these last few months.""  Not only did Shakira sing her heart out -- in English and Spanish -- for nearly two hours and delivered classics like “Inevitable,” “Tú” and “Antología” and her most recent hits such as “Me Enamoré” and “Chantaje,” she also danced all night long. Even as mother of two, those hips still don’t lie.  Working the stage from left to right and walking along a runway that stretched to the center of the venue, the hypnotizing and infectious hip moves came when the chart-topping artist sang tracks like “Perro Fiel,” “Dare (La La La),” “Waka Waka” and “Loca.”  Of course, the sexy, upbeat tracks called for a change in wardrobe and for those, Shakira appeared onstage with her staple belly dancing wraps covered with beads and coins that really accentuated her hip-swiveling moves.  Two special guests spotted in the crowd were Shakira’s sons: Milan and Sasha. The two almost stole the show when they were ushered to their front row seats where they would see their mamá in all her glory. From the stage and throughout the show, she blew kisses their way.  Another fan favorite moment was when Shakira appeared on the other side of the venue wearing a long, gold dress to sing “Toneladas” and right after, made her way back to the main stage walking in the middle of the crowd and stopping to snap a few selfies and greet fans who threw themselves at her as she passed by.  The grand finale was a succession of hits, including “Rabiosa,” “Hips Don’t Lie,” “La Tortura” and “La Bicicleta.” It reminded us of how vast Shakira's catalog is, and how enduring the hits are, even after a seven-year wait.  “First night in the U.S., incredible,” she wrote on social media immediately after the concert. “Thank you, Chicago.”",0
"Season 14 of NBC’s hit singing reality competition show The Voice starts in only a few weeks, and there is already bad blood between veteran judge Blake Shelton and network executives. In fact, as RadarOnline.com previously reported, the country singer may be leaving the show after this year!  And according to production insider – all the drama started with Shelton’s lady love, Gwen Stefani!  As Radar readers know, Shelton, 41 – who has won 6 of the 13 seasons to date – started dating Stefani while the two starred alongside each other on season 9.

PHOTOS: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani Hold Hands In First Major Outing As Couple  Needless to say, producers ran with that and utilized the two for show ratings by giving them a massive bonus under the condition that they would pack on the PDA for all the world to see!  Unfortunately, they didn’t — and according to the source, “producers felt really shafted because they were told to bring the love, and instead they were unaffectionate.”  “They did one duet together the whole season, and seemed to be more jealous than in love with each other,” the insider told Radar.  PHOTOS: Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Getting Bonuses For PDA  According to the source, the drama heated up after season 12 ended, and the network announced that they were replacing Stefani with younger pop star Miley Cyrus, 25, and Jennifer Hudson, 36.  “Blake threw a fit when he found out that Gwen was not going to return and that she was replaced by Miley,” the source said, adding that the star “has been super resentful ever since.”  As fans know, Shelton was not a fan of Hudson either, and the two got into several heated fights on and off-camera!

"[PHOTO:Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence says she looks forward to ‘Satan destroying Donald Trump’]  In a bizarre rant, Oscar-winning Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence has said that she is “looking forward” to Donald Trump being “destroyed” by “our Lord Satan.”The Hunger Games star makes no secret of her disdain for the president and has been one of his more vocal critics since he first started his campaign to run for office.  Her criticisms have often seemed a little misguided, but this time she seems to have attacked his “Jesus bullsh*t” Christian values.The White House Christmas decorations this year is themed “Time-honored traditions,” and features a nativity scene that was chosen by first lady Melania Trump – religious references being something that was avoided by the previous president.  Shortly after arriving for The Hollywood Reporter’s 2017 Women In Entertainment Breakfast held at Milk Studios on Wednesday (December 6) in Los Angeles, Lawrence was heard chatting with a group of friends in the VIP area, drink in hand, when the conversation turned sour after someone mentioned Donald Trump.”Don’t get me started on that guy,” she blasted, holding her glass up. “I’d love to throw this martini in his face!”  As the group laughed in agreement, she continued with the rant: “And what’s with all this nativity, Jesus bullsh*t in the White House all of a sudden?”That’s not our Lord.”Trump is not one of us.”I’m looking forward to watching Satan destroy that guy.”  Lawrence was then ushered away by her assistant leaving the group looking a little perplexed by the comments.This isn’t the first time the liberal actor has directed a strange tirade towards Mr. Trump.In September, Lawrence claimed that the spate of natural disasters that devastated the US and surrounding nations over the summer was down to “Mother Nature” taking her revenge on the US for voting in Donald Trump as president.

"HBO has closed deals with four different writers to explore multiple possible spinoffs of “Game of Thrones.”  The premium cable channel says that there is no timeline for development of the projects. “We’ll take as much or as little time as the writers need and, as with all our development, we will evaluate what we have when the scripts are in,” a spokesperson said.  The four writers are Max Borenstein (“Kong: Skull Island”), Jane Goldman (“Kingsman: The Golden Circle”), Brian Helgeland (“Legend”), and Carly Wray (“Mad Men,” “The Leftovers”). Goldman and Wray will each be working individually with novelist and “Game of Thrones” creator George R. R. Martin.  “Game of Thrones” executive producers and showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff will be attached to the four projects, as will Martin, but will not write on any of them.  A spinoff to “Game of Thrones” — the most watched series in HBO history — has been a source of speculation for years. In recent months, HBO executive began to privately acknowledge that the network was searching for writers to develop ideas based on the series and Martin’s best-selling fantasy novels from which it is adapted.  Related ‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7: First Photos  Asked about a possible spinoff last year at the Television Critics Association summer press tour, HBO programming president Casey Bloys said, “We’ve talked about it. It’s something I’m not opposed to. But, of course, it has to make sense creatively. I am not sure that the guys [Weiss and Benioff] can really wrap their heads around it when they’re just about to start production. It’s a pretty intense production. They’re about to start production soon, but I’m open to it. The guys weren’t opposed to it, but there is no concrete plans, or anything like that at this point.”  Season 7 of “Game of Thrones” is set to premiere July 16. Production on the show pushed the premiere of the new season past its usual April start date, in order to capture the weather the producers wanted. The new season will consist of seven episodes. The eighth and final season, which Weiss and Benioff have already begun writing, will be between six and eight episodes.  The Season 6 finale of “Game of Thrones” drew a series-high 8.9 million viewers in overnight numbers —an especially high number given premium HBO’s much smaller viewer base than broadcast and basic-cable nets. Season 6 averaged 23.3 million multiplatform viewers, according to the service.",0
"What's going on between Pamela Anderson and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange?  The former ""Baywatch"" actress has frequently been photographed visiting Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he's been living in exile since 2012 in an effort to avoid bail violation charges in the UK and extradition to the US, where he's wanted to leaking classified documents.  At the end of March, the embassy revealed that it had revoked Assange's visitor privileges and access to the internet because he went against ""a written [agreement] not to issue messages that might interfere with other states.""  Reacting to the news, Anderson released a statement to the New York Post expressing her disapproval of the embassy's latest move.

""He must be protected. We are all Julian Assange.""  With her visits to Assange suddenly halted, Anderson is once again drumming up speculation around the nature of her relationship with the controversial figure. Though the actress has been dating 32-year-old soccer star Adil Rami since 2017, it's unclear whether or not that romance is exclusive.  ""I don't want to say anything about whether there's a romance,"" Anderson once told Grazia of her relationship with Assange. ""So, let's say we're just 'good friends.'""  Sources close to the WikiLeaks founder say that he has a ""deep crush"" on the actress because ""she's just out of reach.""  ""Julian has a thing for blondes and he's always been quite the womanizer,"" a source told Page Six. ""But Pam's much more intelligent than most women with that kind of look -- she's no bimbo.""  Assange has reportedly ""had a lot of so-called 'girlfriends' visit him there before Pam,"" but ""they were the kind of groupies who fall for men in prison.""  Though neither has done much to quell rumors of a romance between them, sources familiar with the ""Baywatch"" actress question her motives in getting involved with Assange and her highly-photographed visits to see him.  ""Pam thrives on attention from famous men, and she thrives on press,"" one source said. ""It's no accident she shows up to the embassy in those sexy outfits. They are all very contrived.""  Indeed, the outfits that Anderson has worn to visit Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy are always glamorous, often skin-baring and definitely thought-out. The paparazzi are frequently already there catching her enter and exit the property, often carrying bags full of food.

"Ashley Judd spoke out Thursday in her first TV appearance since publicly accusing film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment earlier this month.  During an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer, the “Double Jeopardy” actress became emotional as she described Weinstein making unwanted sexual advances on her nearly two decades ago.  “I thought no meant no,” Judd said during the interview, which aired on “Good Morning America.” “I fought with this volley of no’s, which he ignored.”  .@AshleyJudd on Harvey Weinstein encounter: “If I could go back retrospectively with a magic wand...I wish I could prevent it for anyone.” pic.twitter.com/1NbOgJELeM — Good Morning America (@GMA) October 26, 2017  Judd first described the encounter in a bombshell report published by The New York Times earlier this month. She told the Times that Weinstein sexually harassed her in his hotel room during what she believed would be a business meeting.  “[Weinstein] had her sent up to his room, where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower, she recalled in an interview,” reported the Times.  .@AshleyJudd on Harvey Weinstein: “What I'd say to Harvey is I love you and I understand that you're sick...there's help for a guy like you” pic.twitter.com/3mBkJQ8uMl — Good Morning America (@GMA) October 26, 2017  “I didn’t expect that I would feel tearful,” Judd told Sawyer, fighting back tears. “But it’s been an absolutely, tremendously moving two and a half or three weeks.”  Judd said she could never forgive Weinstein for what he had done to women, and added that he “absolutely” should go to jail if the sexual assault allegations against him are true.  Still, Judd said she believes there is “hope and help” for everyone, including sexual predators.  “There has to be a real profound understanding on the part of the sexual predator that what he was doing was wrong and criminal,” Judd said.  “What I would say to Harvey is, I love you and I understand you are sick and suffering,” she added. “And there is help for a guy like you, too.

"Seven years of good luck! Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Sunday, April 29, and Kensington Palace commemorated the occasion with an adorable photo of the couple from their wedding day.  “Seven years ago today – thank you for all the lovely messages on The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding anniversary!,” the Palace captioned an Instagram pic, which shows the then-newlyweds driving away from Buckingham Palace in a convertible.  The royal couple, who tied the knot in 2011, left their wedding reception in a blue vintage Aston Martin Volante, which belongs to the groom’s father, Prince Charles. The car was decorated by William’s best man, his brother Prince Harry and it was adorned with red heart balloons, balloons with their initials and a license plate with the words “JU5T WED.”  The pair received quite the anniversary present this year — they welcomed their third child less than a week ago. The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Prince Louis Arthur Charles in London on Monday, April 23. The baby, who is fifth in line to the British throne, weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces. They are also the parents of Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2.  As previously reported, William, 35, will act as his little brother’s best man when Harry, 33, weds Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle on May 19. Us Weekly exclusively revealed in December 2017 that Harry had asked his older brother to be his best man and Kensington Palace confirmed it on Thursday, April 26.  “Prince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his Best Man at his wedding to Ms. Meghan Markle,” the statement read. “The Duke of Cambridge is honored to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St George’s Chapel, Windsor on May 19th.”  The statement continued: “Prince Harry served as best man to The Duke of Cambridge at his wedding to Miss Catherine Middleton in 2011.”  William will have his own shot at decorating the Suits alum and Harry’s wedding car and revealing embarrassing secrets about his brother during his speech at the reception. “It feels great. I’m thrilled and delighted obviously. Revenge is sweet. I’ll be looking forward to it,” William joked at the Greenhouse Sports Centre in London on Thursday.",0
"No charges will be filed against Audrina Patridge's estranged husband, Corey Bohan, after the former Hills star filed a domestic abuse case against him, ET has learned.  Patridge called the Irvine Police Department on Sept. 6 after she stated in court papers that Bohan had been harassing her. After the investigation, the evidence was presented to the Orange County District Attorney’s office which, after review, rejected the case.  “The prosecutor reviewed all of the information provided by the Irvine Police Department and, unfortunately, the prosecutor did not feel that they would be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" a spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney’s office told ET on Monday.  Patridge's rep tells ET in a statement, ""Audrina is putting on a brave face, but these exchanges between Audrina and Corey are court ordered to take place at a police station for her protection. There is still a family law domestic violence case open.""  Corey Bohan Responds to Audrina Patridge's Restraining Order as She Requests He Be Forced Out of Their Home  Patridge and Bohan tied the knot last November after dating on and off since 2008, and share 1-year-old daughter, Kirra. Patridge filed for divorce on Wednesday, citing irreconcilable differences, and listed her and Bohan's date of separation as Sept. 6. According to court documents obtained by ET, two days prior to filing for divorce, Patridge requested a temporary restraining order against the Australian BMX rider for an alleged domestic violence incident. A judge in Orange County, California, granted Patridge's request, ordering Bohan to stay 100 yards away from her. Bohan was granted monitored visitation of Kirra, and their next hearing is set for Oct. 6.  ""Audrina’s No. 1 priority is her daughter and she asks for privacy at this time,"" Patridge's rep told ET at the time.  On Saturday, the 32-year-old reality star broke her silence about the divorce drama, posting a video of Kirra on Instagram.  ""Light of my life. This little beauty lights up the room wherever she is!"" she wrote. ""I appreciate all your thoughts & messages, this is a difficult time but we are doing ok xoxo.""

"Pro golfer Bill Haas and actor Luke Wilson were both involved in a fatal car crash in California.  Los Angeles police tell KTLA that Haas, 35, was a passenger in a Ferrari that was involved in a head-on collision with a BMW Tuesday evening in Pacific Palisades, Calif. The driver of the Ferrari, a 71-year-old man who has not been identified, was pronounced dead at the scene.  The Ferrari also rolled over in the crash, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.  According to USA Today, Haas and the BMW driver, a 50-year-old woman, were both taken to the hospital. LAPD says Haas, a six-time winner on the PGA Tour, was seriously hurt but did not suffer life-threatening injuries.  NBC reports Wilson, the 46-year-old star of movies like ""Old School"" and ""Idiocracy,"" was indirectly involved in the incident. He was driving on Chautauqua Boulevard when the Ferrari clipped his vehicle before colliding with the BMW.  Wilson does not appear to have suffered any serious injuries. It's unclear how much damage occurred on his vehicle.  Golf Digest reports Haas, ranked among the top 100 golfers, was in the area for this week's Genesis Open at the Riviera County Club. A source told the magazine that he is ""not good,"" but is in stable condition; his management has yet to say if he'll still play in the tournament.  Officials have not said what caused the crash or detailed any events leading up to the collision. An investigation is ongoing.

"Did Angelina Jolie squash a truce with Jennifer Aniston? Angie reportedly rejected meeting with Jen, as she’s livid that Brad Pitt and Jen are friends again!  Can we ever have peace in our time? Jennifer Aniston, 49 reportedly “extended an invitation” to sit down with Angelina Jolie, 42, over dinner, sources tell In Touch magazine. “Jen thought it was finally time to resolve the past,” an insider said, adding that since her marriage with Justin Theroux, 46, is over, Jen “wants a fresh start on all fronts.” However, Angelina supposedly turned the invite down! When Jen asked why Angie refused to meet her, the Girl, Interrupted star said “she didn’t owe her an apology,” per the source. “The whole idea to get together for dinner turned into a disaster.”  So, why did Angie go all Maleficent on Jen’s attempt to squash their beef? Well, Jen and Brad Pitt, 52, have reportedly rekindled their friendship following her spit from Justin. The two supposedly have these late night meetings, all set up by Brad’s bud George Clooney, 56, and it’s like old times again. Jen has reportedly found “closure” with Brad over leaving her for Angie in 2004, and an insider says, “there may even be a future for the two of them.”  The idea of Angie’s ex chilling with his other ex doesn’t sit well with her. “It’s gotten back to her that Brad and Jen are in each other’s lives again. She’s furious about it,” the insider tells In Touch. So much for these two burying whatever bad blood might be lingering between them. Angie once said that she would “welcome…a real sit-down-and-talk kind of meeting,” per Pop Sugar. That was back in 2006, and it seems that fans will have to wait a little bit longer before these two patch things up.  In the meantime, Jennifer may not linger too much on Angie’s alleged snub. She’s ready to move on past her split with Justin and into the next stage in her life. This, as it turns out, includes giving dating a whirl, and she’s looking for a younger man to put some excitement back into her life. Jen’s all about having fun “without falling in love,” a source close to Jennifer EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. Jennifer thinks she can achieve that by finding “a younger guy [who] doesn’t want to settle down.” Get it, girl!",1
"It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, “including thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief.His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Trending: Journalist Laura Loomer Files Assault Charges Against Maxine Waters Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.“Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.But the program was a surprise to Mexico“The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?”Regarding preventing kids from becoming repeat offenders, the Juvenile Referral Process worked, But why is it okay to incarcerate kids based on a belief without a judge or knowledge of their parents? The only reason I can think of is that a program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered unAmerican when the president is a Republican.Below is a video of an Illegal Immigrant child detention center published in July 2014.﻿Note: The picture in the post may or may not be of the Mexican children discussed above. Based on the Washington Post we know that the detention center in McAllen, TX was one of the locations used and July 2014 is during the active period of the Juvenile Referral Process.illegal immigrantsillegal immigrantsillegal immigrants",1

"Ever since his breakup with Anna Faris last summer, many have been wondering who the next woman in Chris Pratt’s life is going to be. The guy is hot as hell, not to mention he could make you laugh in under a minute. He’s one of the most eligible bachelors out there and we are dying to know who he’s going to date next. It’s been a year since his separation with Faris and it doesn’t seem like those two are rekindling things anytime soon.  He was recently seen out for a coffee with a “mystery blonde,” and the rumor mills are going about who she can be. Pratt has had many blondes in his life so it could be anyone. Whether he’s meeting a friend for coffee or if it’s something more, the gossips are out circling like wolves. Could Pratt be taking himself off the market? He doesn’t have a whole lot of time to date these days, now that he became an Avenger, he’s going to be busier than ever. Avengers: Infinity War is coming out in April and that is sure to keep him busy while he’s on the movie tour. Two months after that, we will see the much-anticipated Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. With two summer hits coming his way, he'll probably reach a whole new level of fame. Does he have time for his new mystery blonde? Let’s check out 15 celebs Chris Pratt should date instead of the “mystery blonde.”  advertising  15 Pratt Should Take On The Black Widow  Scarlett Johansson is one of the most eligible females in the industry right now and one of the foxiest women in Hollywood. How hot would it be if these two started dating? Now that Pratt has instated himself in the Avengers, he’s on a whole new level and could certainly score a date with this beauty.  There was certainly a time that he would not have been considered in the same league as Johansson. However, she just got divorced again, so she may be looking for some fresh meat.  She is the Black Widow after all. She doesn’t have the best track record for relationships whereas Pratt really has only had two major relationships since he's been in Hollywood and one was his marriage to Faris. But the two would definitely steam up things in Hollywood together for sure.  14 Haley Bennett Is More Than Magnificent  advertising  Haley Bennett is certainly one blonde who is cute as a button. She would make a great addition to Pratt’s life.  He does have a history of liking petite blondes, so she would fit right in.  The two were costars together for the movie The Magnificent Seven. Pratt was definitely impressed with his costar when they were shooting the movie because she could handle a rifle better than anyone else on set. She did have one mishap though: ""My bullets flew up and fell into my cleavage,"" she said. ""They burn you. You could just smell the flesh burning,"" Bennett said. ""When I was riding the horses, I would get chaffing. We had mosquito bites and my hands were raw from the reigns and my legs were raw from the stirrups because I was wearing a dress."" Maybe working together wasn’t that hot.  13 Love On The Set Of Jurassic World  Bryce Howard was another gorgeous celebrity that had rumor mills booming when he split from Anna Faris. The two worked together on Jurassic World and became super close. Howard cried when filming ended and the two were recently reunited for the making of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Howard is (un)fortunately happily married and has been since 2006, so we’re not likely to see her with Pratt anytime soon. She does tend to stalk the men that she’s interested in, or at least that’s how she got her husband.  “I had an enormous crush on him — he was gorgeous, and it was love at first sight, but not for him.  I basically stalked him, there was no interest, and then I called him at a really inappropriate hour in the middle of the night and asked him out for coffee.”  12 Jennifer Lawrence Is His Best Female Friend  advertising  Anytime that there is news about Chris Pratt with a blonde, we have to automatically check to see if it’s Jennifer Lawrence. We’ve all been dying to know if the rumors of a fling between them were really true. Of course, when Pratt and Faris first split, all eyes were on Lawrence because let’s be honest, when Pratt and Lawrence were in the movie Passengers together, their Instagram posts were insane.  The pictures alone, never mind their intense chemistry, would have had most wives filing for a divorce. You can’t fake chemistry like that.  Of course, we all assumed the two would come out and make things official just like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt eventually did. Alas, we are still waiting, but we feel that she is still in the running to be the next blonde in his life.  11 Aubrey Plaza Could Give Pratt A Run For His Money  Before Chris Pratt got insanely hot, he was on the TV show Parks and Recreation with Aubrey Plaza. She played his girlfriend on the show and the two had the natural chemistry of two people who just get each other. Pratt obviously cares about his costar and considers her a friend because he went to see his former costar at the premiere of her movie release, Ingrid Goes West, last year. The two would certainly make a cute couple and they have a lot of history together, so we wouldn't be surprised if they dated.  She was there before he got ripped, so he would know that she would still stick by him if he decided to give up the abs.  The two have a great sense of humor, so that’s an easy match right there.  10 Chris Pratt And The Foxy Olivia Munn  advertising  Recently, Chris Pratt and Olivia Munn were linked together and the two would definitely make a smoking hot couple. Many believe there was some weird love triangle going on between Anna Faris, Pratt, and Munn. There were rumors going around that Munn and Pratt were “secretly dating” and we’re all for that. Many believed that Faris would have been angry about the union because Faris had once told Munn how much she loved Pratt. Munn crushed all our hopes when she made this Instagram story about how she and Pratt were not dating.  ""Hello! 1. Not every woman is scorned and upset after a breakup. 2. Not every woman is ""furious"" at another woman for dating her ex.  3. So even if I was dating @prattprattpratt, some tabloids got me and @annafaris all wrong. 4. Women respect and love each other a lot more than some people like to think. 5. Chris and I would have a horrible celebrity name."" We still think they would be good together.  9 Anna Kendrick Would Make A Cute Girlfriend  Let’s be honest, Chris Pratt loves petite girls that can make him laugh and Anna Kendrick totally fits that category. They would be adorable together.  Kendrick is a little spitfire who would never let Pratt get the last word in and according to Ryan Reynolds, she’s a heck of a kisser, so that’s one extra point for her.  Kendrick also happens to know Aubrey Plaza really well, so maybe Plaza should set it all up if she’s not going to sweep Pratt off his feet. We all know that Pratt should be with a funny girl, that’s just his taste. He was with Faris for a long time and we bet it lasted that long because they could laugh away their problems for a long time.  advertising  8 Emily Vancamp Is A Blast From His Past  advertising  Emily Vancamp and Chris Pratt dated a long time ago before he was famous. Pratt has only had two major relationships while in Hollywood and one of them was with Faris while the other was Vancamp. The two actually played brother and sister on the TV show Everwood which is actually kind of weird since the two were dating at the time.  ""Yeah, we've pretty much gotten used to the response of, 'Ew, that's weird. That's creepy,'"" Pratt said of their relationship in an interview with TV Guide in 2006.  ""The people who know us are happy, and probably expected it to happen eventually. But yeah, every once in a while, we get that one person that's like, 'That's really creepy. You just kissed your sister.'"" The two dated for three years before they broke up.  7 Sarah Hyland Would Be A Great Match  Why didn’t we think of this one before? It’s perfect! Sarah Hyland is a total babe and she would definitely be Chris Pratt’s type of girl. If you have ever checked out her Instagram page, then you know that she can be silly, geeky, funny, and foxy all rolled into one. Some of her pics are very original. She also knows comedy since she's been on the TV show Modern Family. She would be the perfect girl to help Pratt move on from Anna Faris and also forget this new “mystery blonde.” However, since November of last year, Hyland has been linked with Wells Adams, so Pratt may have just missed his chance.  6 Karen Gillan And Pratt Are Promoting Movies Together  advertising  Karen Gillan and Chris Pratt have been in not one, but three movies together. It’s kismet, we swear. Gillan and Pratt first met on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy. Gillian returned for the sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and was reunited with Pratt once again in the new Avengers: Infinity War as well. She will also be starring in the next Avengers movie for 2019. That’s a lot of screen time for the both of them. She’s definitely cute and that seems to be the theme of all the girls he is connected with. Plus, they wouldn’t have to worry about being separated for long periods of time for filming. They seem to do a lot of movies together. We think they would make a great match.  5 Elizabeth Olsen Is Totally A Badass  Elizabeth Olsen plays a lot of badass characters, especially in the Avengers movies. The little sister to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen has paved her own way in Hollywood and Pratt would certainly make a good match for her. Pratt knows what it’s like to play badass characters since he’s been doing it in Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World. These two would have met on the set of the new movie Avengers: Infinity War and we think they would be hot together. She’s clearly a beautiful woman and already has a successful career in Hollywood, so there should be no jealousy between them when it comes to their careers. Sorry, Anna Faris! There are a few costars that Pratt has been connected with that would make great partners for him. Only problem is, it looks like she's kind of friends with Faris since they worked together.  4 The Emma Stone Connection  advertising  Maybe Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are just friends. Sure, why not — those pictures could have been just two buddies just enjoying time alone together. In that case, Lawrence should be helping her best friend Emma Stone out and hooking her up with an amazing guy. We all know that deep down Pratt is a great guy. And did we mention that he has abs? The fact that Lawrence and Stone get along so well because they're weird, it would make her a shoo-in for Pratt.  Stone is hilarious on and off camera, so she would make a perfect girlfriend for Pratt because he likes a girl with a sense of humor.  The two are both currently single, so Lawrence should make the effort and set them up. Unless there’s something holding her back…  3 Elizabeth Debicki Is A Foxy Costar  Elizabeth Debicki is another actress that has been part of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. She worked with Chris Pratt on the first two movies.  Elizabeth Debicki is without a doubt a complete fox and she could give Pratt a run for his money. He better snatch her up because she gets too famous for him.  She is not as well known in the industry as he is, but neither was Anna Faris. Debicki is certainly doing a good job of paving her way in the biz. She was also in The Great Gatsby with Leonardo DiCaprio and she has four movies coming out in 2018, so that’s pretty impressive. She would definitely be a partner that Pratt could stand beside proudly.  2 Emma Watson Is A Force To Be Reckoned With  advertising  Emma Watson would be an amazing partner for Chris Pratt for one reason — she’s a powerful woman in the industry. She’s been in it for a while now thanks to the Harry Potter movies, so she knows how to deal with fame. She also knows how to speak her mind so she can handle paparazzi with the best of them. She’s someone that could handle a powerhouse boyfriend like Pratt and support him right back. She’s a gorgeous actress who is making her way in Hollywood now that she’s no longer a kid anymore. They would be adorable together because we know that Pratt deserves the best when it comes to a girlfriend. Whoever the “mystery blonde” is, we think that Pratt should definitely check out our list before he makes any final decisions.  1 A Rekindling Affair With Anna Faris  Sure, why not? It would be great news all around if Chris Pratt were to reunite with his ex-wife. There are so many reasons why the two should try to make it work. They are awesome together, they are each other’s number-one fan, and they have a cute little boy together. A girl can dream, right?  There was a rumor that Chris Pratt and Anna Faris would get back together.  After all, for the longest time, they were #relationshipgoals. Keep that in mind Blake Lively. You never can tell sometimes what celebrity couples are going to call it quits because we definitely didn’t see this one coming. It’s obvious these two are unlikely to get back together, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t some pretty great options out there for him.  advertising  Give TheRichest a Thumbs up!",1
"In her own words, Barbra Streisand is explaining the decision to clone her beloved curly-haired Coton du Tulear dog Samantha, who died in 2017.  “I was so devastated by the loss of my dear Samantha, after 14 years together, that I just wanted to keep her with me in some way,” the music icon, 75, detailed in an op-ed for the New York Times, published on Friday.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “It was easier to let Sammie go if I knew I could keep some part of her alive, something that came from her DNA,” Streisand recalled. “One of the reasons I chose cloning was because I couldn’t find another curly-haired Coton.”  Before the dog crossed the rainbow bridge, the proud pet owner had cells taken from Sammie’s mouth and stomach.  “We sent those cells to ViaGen Pets in Texas. We weren’t even sure if the cells would take,” Streisand explained, adding, “A friend had cloned his beloved dog, and I was very impressed with that dog.”  RELATED: Barbra Streisand Cloned Her Dog: Here’s the History of Pet Cloning and How Much It Costs  Barbra Streisand and her dog Sammie KMazur/WireImage  While anxiously waiting for the test results to determine whether cloning was possible, Streisand adopted not one, but two dogs in the absence of Sammie.  The first was a rescue: Maltipoo dog Sadie, who is lovingly named after her first dog which was gifted to her by the cast of Funny Girl when she turned 22.  And the second was a straight-haired Coton de Tulear named Miss Fanny, whom Streisand got from Sammie’s breeder after it was revealed that Miss Fanny’s mother is named Funny Girl.  RELATED: PETA Is Trying to Convince Barbra Streisand and Other Celebs to Stop Cloning Their Pets  After welcoming two four-legged members into her family, Streisand was surprised with the call she had been anticipating.  “Not only did the cloning process take, but it produced four puppies!

Happy New Year from my three girls… Pink, Blue & Violet. pic.twitter.com/YW1T317Iyd — Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) January 2, 2018  So the puppies plus Sadie and Miss Fanny meant she suddenly had five dogs in her home — which she admitted was a lot even for her.  Describing herself as a “person who was used to taking my dog everywhere with me, and who never had more than one dog at a time living in my house,” Streisand said she chose to give away Sadie to her manager’s assistant and one of the puppies to the teenage daughter of her A&R rep.

But we love them so much. Each puppy is unique and has her own personality,” Streisand said, though she added: You can clone the look of a dog, but you can’t clone the soul. Still, every time I look at their faces, I think of my Samantha…and smile.”",0

"For those aspiring fairy-tale brides unable to shell out $180,000—which is what Disney’s ultimate fairy tale will set you back—there are other, cheaper ways to feel like a princess. After their weddings, according to Otnes, Princess Diana and Kate Middleton each transformed the wedding-dress industry. “Diana got married in a big, poofy dress with puffed sleeves, Kate in a lacy, fitted gown. The dresses became immediate sources of emulation. There is a reason everyone is waiting with bated breath to find out what Meghan will wear,” said Otnes (who will be celebrating the wedding with her colleagues, wearing fascinator hats and enjoying a British high tea).  The fairy-tale wedding dates back to 15th-century Venice, when a writer named Giovanni Francesco Straparola invented what is now recognized as the standard happy ending. “Before this point, at the end of fairy tales, you had the prince and princess living as hermits, not getting married, waiting to receive their ultimate rewards in heaven,” said Ruth Bottigheimer, a professor at Stony Brook University who specializes in fairy tales. “The new happy ending takes place here on earth, and it takes the shape of a wedding.” Classic fairy-tale weddings involve at least one royal, Bottigheimer said, “because that’s where the money is—the power.” In mid-19th-century Germany, the era of the Brothers Grimm, fairy tales were widely taught in schools. At that point, Bottigheimer said, “the happily-ever-after plot gets injected into the whole European population.”  The fairy-tale wedding—as a consumable good, not a fictional happy ending—arrived in the United States in the 1950s, says Stephanie Coontz, a professor of marriage and family history at Evergreen State College. When World War II ended, marriage rates skyrocketed. Women, employed during the war while the men were away, left the workplace in droves and got married. In 1950, the average age of marriage for women was 20. “If you waited four or five years after that, you’d be labeled a spinster,” Coontz said. In the midst of that pressure, the wedding industry identified an enormous opportunity, using ads to convince women that their wedding would be the biggest day of their lives. At the same time, Disney debuted its rendition of the world’s most famous fictional princess: When it came out in 1950, Cinderella—which ends, of course, in a gilded royal wedding—was, by one count, the highest-grossing film of the year. And so began what Coontz calls “the relentless pursuit of the princess.”  There was something special about Cinderella. In the sweet girl next door who talks to birds and sleeps in the kitchen, Coontz told me, women saw themselves. “This idea that someone who can support you at that level of opulence chooses you, instead of a blue blood … that is a very attractive fantasy,” Coontz says. Particularly after Grace Kelly—another “commoner” (who, yes, happened to be a wildly famous actress)—married Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956, the fairy-tale wedding suddenly felt, well, if not within reach, then at least something worth fantasizing about. The most recent royal marriages, according to Coontz, have been so popular because they play out the same storyline: Rich, royal dude swoops in to save a regular girl from a lifetime of oppressive normality. (Both Middleton and Markle were considered “commoners” at the time of their engagements, though genealogists have since claimed distant royal ties.) “In the past, kings and princes couldn’t marry commoners, so there was no point in fantasizing about it much,” Coontz said. “Now we’ve seen the idea of a ‘love match’ become a reality.”",0
"Khloé Kardashian, just welcomed her first child — a baby girl! — amid rampant speculation about Tristan Thompson‘s alleged infidelities.  A source previously told PEOPLE that though Kardashian, 33, was devastated, she would remain focused on motherhood, explaining that the scandal “doesn’t change that Khloé has dreamed of becoming a mom.”  It’s also not the first time the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star has faced similar rumors. Before she was romantically linked to NBA boyfriend Thompson in September 2016, Kardashian dealt with allegations of extramarital affairs during her nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Lamar Odom.  A source close to Odom, 38, told PEOPLE recently that “Lamar feels terrible for Khloé. He wasn’t sure if he should reach out and see how she’s doing. He feels for her.”  Kardashian and Odom wed on Sept. 27, 2009 — one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) — but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player’s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  Watch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.  Cheating rumors against Odom first circulated in January 2012, when a tabloid report claimed Odom cheated on Kardashian with a woman he met at a Washington, D.C., strip club. And in July 2013, the pair were confronted rumors claiming Odom had been unfaithful to Kardashian after playing a game for the Dallas Mavericks.  RELATED: Everything We Know About Khloé Kardashian’s Romance with Tristan Thompson (So Far)  JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  “Love is blind … Lamar was so great at making me feel like I was the only one and I’m this princess. I never speculated cheating … so I didn’t know about cheating … until before the DUI [in 2013],” Kardashian told Howard Stern in January 2016.  “He was so good. So nothing was on his cell phones, [but] he had an assistant. They were all on his assistant’s phone, so he was really crafty,” she recalled as Stern asked the former Kocktails with Khloé host: “Doesn’t that feel awful when the assistant knows, and everyone knows?” To which Kardashian agreed, “Oh, it’s disgusting.”  RELATED GALLERY: Khloé Kardashian & Lamar Odom: A Timeline of Their Relationship  “But all these rumors kept coming out in the weeklies, and as much as I know they’re bull—-, where there’s smoke there’s fire. Something has to be right here,” Kardashian revealed. “It is humiliating on any level, but I found out he was cheating on me the majority of our marriage, I just didn’t know.”  In October 2015, Odom was rushed to the hospital after being found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. Near death, he spent four days in a coma, and Kardashian rushed to his side and called off their divorce proceedings temporarily.  Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty; JB Lacroix/WireImage  Months before, in July 2015, both stars had signed divorce papers, but the judgment had not yet been entered in court by the time Odom was hospitalized; thus, they were technically still legally married. As a result, Kardashian was making all of Odom’s medical decisions.  Upon his recovery, Odom completed a 30-day drug rehab program.  Khloé refiled for divorce once Odom recovered from the Nevada incident, and their split was finalized in December 2016.  RELATED: Khloé Kardashian Opens Up About Lamar Odom’s Harrowing Ordeal: I’ll Always Be There for Him  RELATED VIDEO: Khloé Kardashian’s BFF Khadijah Haqq Takes Aim at Tristan Thompson During Cheating Scandal  In July 2017, Odom penned an emotional first-person essay for The Players’ Tribune in which he touched on how his drug addiction and infidelity tore apart his marriage.  “Anybody who’s lived a complicated, drug-infused life like I’ve lived knows the cycle — with women, cheating on my wife, s— like that,” he wrote.  Jerritt Clark/Getty Images  One of his “darkest” moments, he admitted, was when Kardashian caught him doing drugs with another woman. “I was in a motel room, getting high with this chick, and my wife (at the time) walked in. That probably was like rock bottom. First of all I was in a motel. A motel,” he remembered.  “I’m a millionaire. I’d made it out of Jamaica, Queens, and won two NBA titles. And I’m in a motel, with some random person, doing coke. But I just wanted to get high with this girl, and I had no other place to go. I couldn’t take her home. You know, I was being a scumbag,” he wrote.  Odom still thinks highly of Kardashian. Asked in January by BET’s Mancave about Khloé being pregnant, Odom said he’s “happy for her,” adding, “She took care of me, she’ll be a good mother. For real. She’s a great woman.”  Now, a source told PEOPLE that when Kardashian got together with Thompson, her sisters were “really happy to see Khloe so excited about someone again because she hadn’t felt that way about a guy since Lamar. Eventually Tristan won over her family too … he really seemed dedicated to her, so this must be a shock to everyone.”",1
"ATLANTIC CITY, NJ — Trashed by emails sent by pageant officials, former Miss Americas may help choose the new leaders of the Miss America Organization.  The group told The Associated Press Wednesday night that it is seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.  In emails that were published last week by the Huffington Post, pageant officials ridiculed the appearance, intellect and sex lives of former Miss Americas. The emails included one that used a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to past Miss America winners, one that wished that a particular former Miss America had died and others that speculated about how many sex partners former Miss America Mallory Hagan has had.  The ensuing uproar led to the group’s executive director, Sam Haskell; its president, Josh Randle; board chairwoman Lynn Weidner, and one other board member to resign.  Dan Meyers, the group’s interim board chairman, said the group wants former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the organization’s leadership structure, and choose individuals to fill those roles.  “The board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion,” he said. “Given the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way.”  Some past winners reacted negatively to the board’s statement, saying the board had not reached out to them about help in selecting new leaders. Others said they wanted no involvement whatsoever by any current board members in seeking new leadership.  see also Miss America execs resign after disgusting emails surface There they go — a series of vulgar e-mails has...  “At this time all remaining members must step aside so we can take our beloved program back,” Miss America 1977 Dorothy Benham told the AP. “They have underestimated the strength, intelligence, and determination of the women who have worn the Miss America crown, as well as every young woman who is currently wearing, or has worn the local and state crown. We stand united.”  Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said the former winners want a completely new board to search for leaders, not one that supported Haskell.  “The board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused,” she told the AP late Wednesday. “They need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program.”  Under the plan, former Miss Americas and state directors collectively would name four people to the search committee, and the board would name a former state title holder to the panel. These five individuals and two board members “will begin their exhaustive search in a matter of days,” a statement from the board read.  There are currently two vacancies on the 14-member board, and there will be at least two more when the resignations of Randle and Weidner become effective in a matter of weeks.  The organization hopes to have the nominations in hand by Jan. 3. The board said it was notifying groups of its decision to seek their help late Wednesday night.  The emails already cost the pageant its television production partner and raised questions about the future of the nationally televised broadcast from Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall the week after Labor Day each year. Dick Clark Productions told the AP last Thursday that it cut ties with the Miss America Organization over the emails, calling them “appalling.”  Meyers said the group has spoken with ABC, the television network scheduled to broadcast the September 2018 pageant, as well as with pageant sponsors. None has ended its relationship with the Miss America Organization, he said. Independent messages sent by the AP over the past two days seeking comment from ABC and pageant sponsors have gone unanswered.",0

"Queen Elizabeth II and her family after Christmas Day service at St. Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham, on Dec. 25, 2017. (Photo: ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images)  It's Christmas again, the time of year when British royals generally step up their round of good work and cheery public appearances before disappearing to private celebrations, far from prying eyes. This year is no different.  Routine is built into royal life, especially for senior royals such as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles the Prince of Wales, whose busy schedules are usually laid out for them months or years in advance.  Each royal year has a certain rhythm: Easter at Windsor Castle, Trooping the Colour and Royal Ascot in June, the annual eight-week holiday at Balmoral in Scotland in late summer, Remembrance Day in November, and Christmas always at Sandringham House.  Sandringham:  For the past three decades, the queen has hosted her sprawling family at her private estate in Norfolk for the Christmas and New Year holidays. There they exchange cheap gag gifts and sit down to a black-tie Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve.  On Christmas morning, they have breakfast (the men go downstairs for a hearty ""fry up,"" the women have something light served in their rooms, according to former royal chef Darren McGrady), then gather before 11 a.m. local time to walk to services at nearby St. Mary Magdalene Church. They return for Christmas lunch and then gather around the TV to watch the queen's annual Christmas speech to the nation and the Commonwealth.  (This is required watching for the family as it is the only speech the queen gets to write herself without involvement from the government of the day. It used to be broadcast from Sandringham, starting with her grandfather in 1936, but now she usually records it ahead of time.)  A clutch of British royals, led by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla Duchess of Cornwall, walk to attend a Christmas service in Sandringham, Dec. 25, 2016. (Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth/ AP)  Why Christmas at Sandringham? It's a private country mansion, unlike Windsor Castle, some of which is open to the public. Unlike Windsor, it's about two hours away by train from London and the media, although there is always an organized photo shoot of the family walking to their little church, even Prince Philip, 97. But not the queen; she is usually driven to church.  Most important, Sandringham is much-loved by the queen and her family, including her father and grandfather, both of whom died there.  Last year, Prince Harry and his then-fiancee, Meghan Markle, were among the walkers –an unprecedented honor for her since she had not yet officially joined the family, their May wedding still months away.  Sandringham estate is sprawling (20,000 acres) so it's suitable for the annual Boxing Day (Dec. 26) pheasant shoot that Philip used to be in charge of organizing, although now that he's finally retired from public life, he may have passed that task on to someone else.  Last year, Harry skipped the shoot, reportedly to spare Meghan's animal-rights sympathies, and he may be absent again this year. Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana, also loathed blood sports but from boyhood on, her sons have joined in enthusiastically with their royal relations.

Prince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge and their three children, Prince George, 5, Princess Charlotte, 3, and baby Prince Louis, have a country retreat, Anmer Hall, nearby on the estate, gifted to them by the queen.  Their retreat allows them to participate in the Christmas festivities at Sandringham House while also hanging out with their three small children.  Anmer Hall on the Sandringham Estate on Jan. 13, 2013. (Photo: Indigo/Getty Images)  Last year, Harry and Meghan stayed with Will and Kate at Anmer Hall for Christmas. This year, when they are expecting their first child in the spring, they are going to be at Sandringham alongside Will and Kate, despite all the tabloid rumor-mongering about alleged tensions between the brothers and their wives.  Sometimes Will and Harry play in a charity soccer match on Christmas Eve, pitting Sandringham staff and estate neighbors.  Will and Kate take Christmas cheer to military families:  The Cambridges went all the way to Cyprus to say Merry Christmas to Royal Air Force families. First, on Dec. 4, they hosted a holiday party at Kensington Palace for families whose loved ones are serving at a British base on the island.  Duchess Kate of Cambridge meets children at Kensington Palace where she and Prince William hosted a Christmas party for families and children of Royal Air Force personnel serving on Cyprus, Dec. 4, 2018. (Photo: Richard Pohle/ AP)  They collected gifts and letters from the children and the next day hopped on a plane to deliver them to the men and women based at RAF Akrotiri, where they attended another Christmas party for troops who will be apart from their families throughout the holiday season.  Kensington Palace's Twitter account quickly filled up with tweets documenting the fun and laughs had by all at both parties.

In past years, Kate has also attended the annual Christmas party at one of her older patronages, the Anna Freud National Center for Children and Families, a child mental health research, training and treatment center in London.  Duchess Meghan's Christmas appearance  In keeping with her former career as an actress (USA's ""Suits""), she made a solo visit to the Royal Variety Charity’s residential nursing and care home, Brinsworth House in London, on Tuesday to bring holiday cheer to three dozen residents, including singing carols around a Christmas tree.  Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex watch fireworks at their wedding reception at Frogmore House, Windsor, on May 19, 2018. The picture is on their Christmas card for 2018. (Photo: Chris Allerton/ PA / Handout/ EPA-EFE)  The Royal Variety Charity, of which the queen is patron, may end up in Meghan's portfolio when the palace announces her royal philanthropic menu next year.  It's a good fit for her, as the charity helps take care of hundreds of retired entertainers who have fallen on hard times due to old age, illness or financial disaster.  The charity is supported in part by the annual Royal Variety Performance in November in London, which Meghan attended this year with Prince Harry.  Camilla's Christmas tradition:  Duchess Camilla of Cornwall, the second wife of Prince Charles, is a big fan of Christmas. Every year in early December she hosts a children's lunch party at Clarence House in London where the kids help her decorate the palace Christmas tree.  “The tree decorating for me is always the start of Christmas,"" she told reporters the day of the Dec. 6 party this year. ""I haven’t thought about it before today, but I come in and see the tree and the children and everything and it just gets me in a Christmas mood.""  Duchess Camilla of Cornwall meets reindeer Dancer, left, and Blitzen, right, with their handlers Karen and Jason Perrins in the gardens at Clarence House in London, Dec. 6, 2018. (Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP)  This year, she took some of the kids outside to meet two reindeer, ""Dancer"" and ""Blitzen,"" and their handler elves, leading to cute pictures of them all feeding lichen to the not-so-tiny antlered critters.  For the past nine years, the kids and families invited to Camilla's party have been beneficiaries of the Helen & Douglas House hospice center and Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity, two organizations for which Camilla serves as patron. Every year the organizations help support thousands of children who suffer from chronic illnesses.  The queen's Christmas lunch:  The week before Christmas, the queen hosts a huge festive lunch for her extended family at Buckingham Palace, including those who will not be at Sandringham. This gives the monarch an opportunity to catch up with relatives she might not see regularly during the year.  Last year, Meghan Markle was included, in another sign of how quickly she was accepted into the family ahead of the wedding. Tradition reportedly dictates that the lunch is attended by only relatives and spouses.  On Wednesday, Dec. 19, Meghan was photographed smiling next to Harry as the two drove onto the palace grounds for this year's luncheon. She sported large diamond studs and what appeared to be a top with a high collar.  Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan arrive at the annual Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in London on Dec. 19, 2018.

Photographers also captured Prince George peeking through the backseat.  Prince William, Duchess Kate and their son Prince George arrive at the queen's Christmas lunch.

Their routine was interrupted (a rarity) in 2016 when, the day after the lunch, Buckingham Palace suddenly announced they had postponed their departure because the two had ""heavy colds."" They were flown there by helicopter the next day.  Queen Elizabeth II poses at her desk in the 1844 Room at Buckingham Palace, on Dec. 13, 2017, after recording her Christmas Day broadcast to the nation and the Commonwealth. (Photo: JOHN STILLWELL/AFP/Getty Images)  The Royal Christmas Cards:  Every year, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla, Will and Kate, and now Harry and Meghan send out Christmas cards featuring family photos. This year, Charles and Camilla posed on a garden bench at Clarence House, their London home. The Cambridges posed in the branches of a tree in the garden at Anmer Hall.  And Harry and Meghan chose a previously unseen black and white photo of themselves watching the fireworks at Frogmore House after their second wedding reception to adorn their 2018 card.  But it's the card from the queen that counts. Every year, she and Prince Philip send around 750, usually featuring a family photo, to family, friends and members of the Royal Household staff, along with others such as British and Commonwealth prime ministers, governors-general and high commissioners.  Prince Philip usually sends another 200 cards to different regiments and organizations with whom he's long been associated.  The Royal Christmas Gifts:  All members of the Royal Household receive presents from the queen, who personally hands them out to some members of her household staff at Buckingham Palace and at Windsor Castle.  Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla pose on the grounds of Clarence House, London, for their 2018 Christmas card. (Photo: Hugo Burnand/Clarence House via AP)  The Royal Christmas Puddings:  Continuing the tradition from her father, King George VI, and her grandfather, George V, the queen also gives out about 1,500 Christmas puddings to her staff in the palaces, in the Court Post Office and the palace police. Each pudding is accompanied by a greeting card from the queen and Prince Philip.  Americans are familiar with ""pudding"" as a custard treat. A British Christmas pudding, also known as a ""plum pudding"" or a ""figgy pudding,"" is nothing like that. It's a medieval soft cake-like dessert made of dried fruits held together by egg, suet, treacle or molasses, and flavored with spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  The Royal Christmas Trees:  The tradition of decorating trees at Christmas was popularized by British royals, specifically Queen Victoria and her German-born husband Prince Albert, both of whom had grown up with the custom. Her German ancestors introduced the idea to the English and her German mother continued it. By the 1860s it was a thing, with hundreds of trees being sold in Covent Garden.  As well as donating money to several charities in Windsor each Christmas, the queen also gives Christmas trees to Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, St. Giles' Cathedral and the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh. Churches and schools in the Sandringham area will also receive a tree from Her Majesty.  Decorated trees go up at the London palaces, and at Sandringham there's a large silver artificial tree in the dining room decorated by the grandchildren and great-grandchildren, according to former royal chef McGrady, who dished about the tradition in an interview with Good Housekeeping.

Friends First  Many times Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross’ romance has been called a “whirlwind” relationship because of the pace in which they started dating and became engaged. What many don’t know, however, is that the pair were actually friends first. The two actually first met in the early 2000s while on the Hollywood club scene and had many mutual friends which meant they hung out regularly, so they were friends for 10 years before starting a romantic relationship.

"Fans of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars may have thought they had seen the last of the eliminated queens. However, Ru is always full of surprises and his biggest twist yet happened in the season finale. He brought back the eliminated queens who determined the top two for the season. Because of their decision, Trixie Mattel won Drag Race All Stars 3, and pretty much no one saw it coming. The eliminated queens returning to Drag Race changed everything, because for the first time in the series’ herstory, they had the real power.  In previous seasons of All Stars, Ru had made determinations of who the top queens would be through their performances in various challenges. This season, that changed. The eliminated queens were back as a “Jury of Queer Peers” in Ru’s words. They acted in similar roles to other iconic reality TV shows that maintain a jury pool, like Survivor or Big Brother.  In the end, the top two queens the jury chose were Trixie Mattel and Kennedy Davenport. Then it was between them to see who could win the crown.  This was a much more exciting returning twist than the first time the eliminated queens came back to the competition in Episode 7. Then, it could have given a returning queen the boost to ride and potentially win the competition. However, it ended up being rather anticlimactic. That is because the queen who returned, Morgan McMichaels, was sent back home the week after she’d returned. This second return of the queens was so much more dramatic, though.  Their decision brought up a central question for viewers: What does it mean to be the winning Drag Race Queen? This twist mattered so much because it is what fundamentally changed the competition and its future. In the past, it has been clear that the queen who was most successful throughout the competition deserved to be crowned queen. All Stars 3 was different.  The eliminated queens determined the top two based on who they felt needed the title and money the most. They chose to reward the queens that they felt needed a bigger platform or wouldn’t be as successful on their own without the win. It really was a backhanded compliment when the eliminated queens picked Kennedy and Trixie as the top two. The most successful and deserving queens in the competition were barred from competing, in that sense.  Of course, that meant that Shangela was not going to even get a shot at the crown. She has one of, if not the largest fanbase of any of the queens this season and ended up winning tens of thousands of dollars throughout the competition. It was clear that Shangela had been the front-runner — however, her success outside this competition clearly kept her from being considered for the top two.  Shangela had won more challenges than anyone and she had never lost a lip-sync. She had proven throughout the competition that if it wasn’t BenDeLaCreme who would win, the crown should most logically be hers. Despite that, she wasn’t allowed to lip-sync for her legacy in the end.  But Shangela was not the only one who was robbed of an opportunity. While BeBe had clearly made some enemies with her demeanor throughout the show, she had been consistently one of the best after Shangela. However, it was obvious that the eliminated queens didn't want BeBe to potentially win two crowns. Again, in their view, she didn’t “need” the win.  More than in any previous season of Drag Race, the eliminated queens of All Stars 3 truly mattered. Despite BenDeLaCreme and Shangela absolutely dominating the competition, it was not to be that either of them would wear the crown. Finally, it was the eliminated queens' decision that allowed Trixie to win the crown. While some, (perhaps rightfully) think that twist was unfair or out of place, the season is now over. Ultimately, it is RuPaul’s drag world, and we’re all just living in it.",0

"Dropping hints. Long Island Medium star Theresa Caputo opened up about her problematic relationship with husband Larry during the current season of the hit TLC show before shocking fans with the announcement of their split on Sunday, December 3.  “Since the last season of Long Island Medium, Larry and I’s relationship has changed,” Theresa, 51, revealed to a friend on the November 13 episode. “We’ve been there for each other, you know, through thick and thin, you know, good times, and right now are not such great times. I don’t understand it. I lay in bed, and I say to myself, ‘How did this happen? How did I get here?’”  “I sometimes interpret it as growing apart,” the reality star said of their almost three-decade-long marriage during a confessional in the same episode. “I’ve changed and he has changed. We’re both not happy and, you know, it’s hard to try to work through that.”  The medium, who has starred on Long Island Medium with her family since 2011, also broke down on the November 27 episode during a reading.  “I’m gonna say something, and I’m gonna regret it,” a teary Theresa said, walking off camera. “Things happen. I can’t, I can’t do this.”  “I’m in the middle of a reading with Erin and my own emotions about my relationship with Larry got the best of me,” she later explained. “This is a really hard time right now with Larry and I, and I don’t know what’s going to happen. It’s just, it’s wearing on me.”  As previously reported, the pair, who married in 1989 and are parents to Larry Caputo Jr., 24, and Victoria Caputo, 23, announced their split in a statement on Sunday.  “After 28 years of marriage, we have decided to legally separate,” they said in a statement to statement to Us Weekly. “We will always love each other and our two wonderful children. We are united in supporting each other and our family.

"Robert Pattinson surprisingly reunited with old flame Kristen Stewart on Feb. 11 and his ex FKA Twigs is weighing in on the meet up. Find out how she feels here.  Robert Pattinson, 31, and Kristen Stewart, 27, made headlines when they were seen hanging out together at a bar in Los Angeles on Feb. 11 and although their reunion shocked many people, it hasn’t seemed to do so for Robert’s ex-fiancee FKA Twigs, 30! “(FKA) Twigs isn’t at all concerned about what Robert is doing,” a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “She basically doesn’t even acknowledge his existence or the fact that they were to together for three years. She was really hurt when they decided to split up, and she carried that with her for a couple months before she eventually got over it.” Woah! It’s hard to think that a couple who was once so close and adorable together is now seemingly strangers, but we can definitely understand Twigs’ pain.  Although she’s trying to move on without Robert, it seems Twigs did really care for him when they were together. “When it comes to her feelings about him, she can admit that she did love him at one point, but all of her emotions towards Rob have fizzled,” the source continued. “What they had for each other ran its course and she couldn’t care less if Robert is linking up with Kristen, Katy (Perry) or whomever. Twigs is focused on her music and her career and she has no time for the negative energy.”  Twigs and Robert broke things off last Oct. after being together for more than two years and getting engaged in early 2015. Since then, the Twilight actor has been seen with pal Katy and a mystery blonde woman. We’re not sure who he’ll end up with next, but like Twigs, it seems Robert’s trying to move on as best he can and we wish him nothing but the best!  HollywoodLifers, what do you think about Robert and Kristen’s reunion? Let us know your opinions!",1
"Yorgos Lanthimos’ twisted period piece “The Favourite” led all films in nominations for the 24th Annual Critics’ Choice Awards, the Broadcast Film Critics Association announced on Monday. At the same time, the BFCA’s sister organization, the Broadcast Television Journalists Association, made “”The Americans,” “Escape at Dannemora” and “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” the most-nominated television programs.  “The Favorite” received 14 nominations, including Best Picture, acting nominations for Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz and directing and screenplay noms.  “Black Panther” showed that it is a formidable awards contender with 12 nominations, followed by “First Man” with 10 and “Mary Poppins Returns,” “A Star Is Born” and “Vice” with nine.  “Roma” received eight nominations, four of them for writer, director, cinematographer and editor Alfonso Cuarón. He would also be in line to accept the film’s Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film, should it win in those categories.  Also Read: 'Roma' Is the Year's Best Film, Say Los Angeles Film Critics  The nominations included most of the top contenders for this year’s awards, though smaller films like “First Reformed,” “A Quiet Place,” “Leave No Trace,” “Support the Girls” and “The Rider” didn’t break into the top categories the way they did in some previous awards and nominations. (“First Reformed” fared the best, landing nominations for actor Ethan Hawke and screenwriter Paul Schrader.)  But it’s hard to really ascertain a specific personality in the Critics’ Choice nominations, simply because the BFCA has gone to extremes to create a show designed to attract as many stars as possible. Not only have they added a number of comedy, action-movie and sci-fi/horror categories, but most of their categories have six or even seven nominees instead of the usual five.  BFCA officials have said the expansions come because of close vote totals, but the distribution of the supersized categories — seven nominees in directing, best actor and best actress, six in almost everything else — suggests a deliberate strategy to cast as wide a net as possible and make it easier to claim accuracy as an Oscar predictor.  Also Read: Golden Globes Nominations Analysis: 'Vice' and 'Green Book' Emerge as Curious Front Runners  Because of that, slightly fewer than 75 percent of last year’s Oscar nominees had first been Critics’ Choice Award nominees. But even with the expanded slates of nominees, the Critics’ Choice nominations correctly predicted all five Oscar nominees in only two categories, Best Actress and Best Original Screenplay.  In the television categories, which are chosen by members of the BTJA, the final season of “The Americans” was the most-nominated series, while the limited series “The Assassination of Gianni Versace” and “Escape at Dannemora” were tops among movies and miniseries.  The nominations were a mixture of shows that were Emmy favorites (“Atlanta,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” “Barry,” “Killing Eve”) new shows that were singled out by Golden Globes voters last week (“A Very English Scandal,” “Homecoming,” “The Kominsky Method”) and ones that are even newer (“Dirty John,” “My Dinner With Hervé”).

"Selena Gomez had to walk away from Justin Bieber when he couldn’t promise her a serious future that included marriage. We’ve got the EXCLUSIVE details.  Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber‘s latest go at love seemed so promising. They’re both much more mature and have come so far since their days of teenage love in the past. At 25, Selena was hoping that Justin could start thinking about a serious commitment in their future — marriage — but the Biebs, 24, wasn’t willing to go there yet. “He loved her very much and still does and she still has strong feelings for him. But he wasn’t ready to settle down with her as soon as she wanted to and she couldn’t get him to actually think about marriage in a serious nature,” a source close to Justin tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  It is easy to bet and win big with Kagwirawo. Click here  Selena underwent a life saving kidney transplant in the summer of 2017. That seemed to make her realize that Justin was worth giving another chance as by late October, she broke up with boyfriend of 10 months The Weeknd, 28, and was back in the “Sorry” singer’s arms. “Selena’s priorities drastically changed after her surgery and her perspective on life has shifted. She was looking to settle down sooner than Justin wanted to and she took his reluctance as the last straw to finally move on from him,” our insider adds.  Sel has fans thinking that she still has Bieber on the brain with the release of her new song “Back To You” on May 10. Its her first single in 2018 and her first new music since her make up and break up with Justin. It included lyrics such as “Let a couple years water down how I’m feeling about you” and “Everybody knows we got unfinished business,” which Selenators immediately assumed was about Justin. The chorus went “What was there wasn’t sure. But I’d go back to you. I know I’d go back to you.” Well, she won’t go back Justin unless he’s ready to think about putting a ring on it!

"Avril Lavigne is alive.  On the 15th anniversary of the pop star’s hit single “Complicated,” a conspiracy theory claiming that she died in 2003 and has been replaced by a lookalike has resurfaced. If you aren’t familiar with the theory, this blogpost dating back to 2011 from a Brazilian site should bring you up to speed. The basic idea is that Lavigne, who was at the peak of her career at the time, committed suicide after her grandfather’s death in 2003. Rather than coming to terms with what had happened, Lavigne’s record company used Melissa Vandella – Lavigne’s doppleganger who was supposedly hired to pose as Lavigne for paparazzi – in her place to profit off of her celebrity.  As the story goes, Vandella then went to record “Under My Skin” as Lavigne (“From here it was no longer the real Avril,” the blog post reads, “but ‘Avril Lavigne’ under the skin of the other singer”) and left subtle hints along the way about what had really happened. That, along with pictures of how Lavigne’s face and handwriting had changed, was all the proof they needed.  There’s just one problem. As Buzzfeed explained in an article titled “Here’s How I Accidentally Made An Old Avril Lavigne Death Hoax Go Viral,” that Brazilian post made it clear at the beginning that it was created to show “how conspiracy theories can look true.” And yet, despite that disclaimer, the theory quickly spread like wildfire thanks to the Buzzfeed writer sharing the conspiracy theory as a joke with his fellow Americans following a visit to Buzzfeed Brazil.  Which brings us to today. Late last week, Twitter used @givenchyass brought the conspiracy theory back to life with a long thread explaining it all. It begins with this tweet, which has over 100,000 retweets and 160,000 favorites:  avril lavigne is dead & was replaced by a look alike: a conspiracy theory thread pic.twitter.com/9eearQ2rte — ? (@givenchyass) May 13, 2017  And quickly divulges into this:  here’s a video I made comparing an avril song from 2002 to an avril song from 2014 pic.twitter.com/1KFZJ8cHnD — ? (@givenchyass) May 13, 2017  This:  @givenchyass BIIIH SHE REALLY TRIED TO TELL US pic.twitter.com/YSgVMHP3sD — Kelly (@kellyblaus) May 14, 2017  This:  @givenchyass Okay so I was looking at these and the corners of their eyes are shaped differently and now I’m geeking pic.twitter.com/ag2G37NsSt — A (@ashlynnktigner) May 14, 2017  And this:  @givenchyass avrils old handwriting vs a latest tweet ???? pic.twitter.com/1cwBbgSBfy — the sweetest heart (@privatelaprip) May 14, 2017  Again, none of this is true – Lavigne is active on social media and revealed that she has an album coming later this year – but the details and photos from that blogpost continue to resurface and act as fodder for those who want to believe it. For that reason, this probably isn’t the last we’ve heard of this conspiracy theory.",0
"Just when you thought the performer lineup for the 2019 MusiCares Person of the Year event honoring GRAMMY-winning country icon Dolly Parton couldn't get any better, it has. GRAMMY winners Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood and past GRAMMY nominees Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry will join the star-studded list of performers paying tribute to Parton in Los Angeles during GRAMMY Week on Friday, Feb. 8, 2019.  Brooks, Yearwood, Cyrus and Perry are the latest additions to an already stacked lineup of previously announced artists who will be performing songs from Parton's impressive musical catalog. Previously announced performers include GRAMMY winners Vince Gill, Don Henley, Norah Jones, P!nk, Kacey Musgraves, Willie Nelson, Mark Ronson, Mavis Staples, and Chris Stapleton, GRAMMY nominees Leon Bridges, Lauren Daigle and Linda Perry and multi-platinum singer/songwriter Shawn Mendes.  To the delight of fans and artists alike, the honoree will be closing out the program with a special performance as well, with GRAMMY-nominated musician Greg Phillinganes serving as the musical director for the evening.  Parton is being recognized as the 2019 MusiCares Person Of The Year, marking the first member of the Nashville music community to receive the honor. She was chosen for her unparalleled contributions to country music and a multitude of charitable causes, including the children's literacy organization she started in 1995, Imagination Library, with which she has donated over 100 million books to kids around the world.  ""Dolly Parton has always been and continues to be a courageous trailblazer and indomitable inspiration for creators and artists—so for us to have the opportunity to honor her at our annual MusiCares Person of the Year gala is to pay tribute to a true pillar of strength and someone who we all look up to and cherish,"" Recording Academy President and CEO Neil Portnow said. ""Dolly also knows the power of philanthropy and she has used her stardom to contribute to a wide range of causes from natural disasters to education and literacy programs.""  MusiCares provides a vital safety net of health and human services programs, and the proceeds from MusiCares annual Person of the Year gala go directly to the charitable organization to continue their much-needed work, which includes helping music people have a place to turn in times of financial, medical and personal need.  The 29th annual gala will open with a reception and silent auction sponsored by Delta Airlines offering an exclusive and unparalleled selection of luxury items, VIP experiences and one-of-a-kind celebrity memorabilia for bidding guests followed by a gala dinner sponsored by AEG complete with a live auction, the tribute concert and the award presentation.

"The Billboard Music Award is an honor given out annually by Billboard, a publication and music popularity chart covering the music business. The Billboard Music Awards show had been held annually since 1990 and the event was formerly held in December[1] until it went dormant in 2006. The awards returned in 2011 and are now held annually in May. The 2018 Billboard Music Awards aired live on NBC on May 20.  Award process [ edit ]  Unlike other awards, such as the Grammy Award, which determine nominations as a result of the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are based on album and digital songs sales, streaming, radio airplay, touring, and social engagement. These measurements are tracked year-round by Billboard and its data partners, including Nielsen Music and Next Big Sound. The 2018 awards are based on the reporting period of April 8, 2017 through March 31, 2018.[2] Awards are given for the top album, artist and single in a number of different music genres.  Ceremonies [ edit ]  [7] This field shows winners of ""Artist of the Year"" (awarded from 1995 to 2006), and ""Top Artist"" (awarded since 2011). Whitney Houston won the award for ""#1 World Artist"".This field shows winners of ""Artist of the Year"" (awarded from 1995 to 2006), and ""Top Artist"" (awarded since 2011).  Categories [ edit ]  From 1989 to 2006, the show had the same categories and category names every year. In 2011, for the first time, all of the awards were renamed to ""Top [award title]"". The ""of the year"" portion of each category title no longer exists, and many of the awards have been further renamed. Other awards, including both ""crossover"" awards (No. 1 Classical Crossover Artist and No. 1 Classical Crossover Album) were discontinued. As of 2017, there are two fan-voted categories.  Current categories [ edit ]  The general categories are Top Artist, Top Billboard 200 Album, Top Hot 100 Song and Top New Artist. These categories highlighted in each award and other categories are divided by genre.  Retired categories (1990–2017) [ edit ]  Top Alternative Album  Top Alternative Artist  Top Alternative Song  Top Classical Crossover Artist  Top Classical Crossover Album  Top Country Collaboration (2017)  Top Dance Artist (until 2013)  Top Dance Album (until 2013)  Top Dance Song (until 2013)  Top Digital Media Artist (until 2012)  Top Digital Songs Artist (until 2015)  Top Digital Song (until 2015)  Top EDM Artist (until 2013)  Top EDM Album (until 2013)  Top EDM Song (until 2013)  Top Independent Artists  Top Independent Album  Top Modern Rock Artist  Top Modern Rock Track  Top New Male Artist  Top New Female Artist  Top New Group/Band  Top New Song  Top Pop Song (until 2013)  Top Pop Album (until 2013)  Top Pop Artist (until 2013)  Top Pop Punk Artist  Top R&B Collaboration (2017)  Top Rap Collaboration (2017)  Top Rhythmic Top 40 Title  Top Selling Single  Top Soundtrack Single of the Year  Milestone Award (2013, 2014)  Special awards [ edit ]  Icon Award [ edit ]  Spotlight Award [ edit ]  In 1988, Michael Jackson was honored with Billboard's first Spotlight Award for being the first artist in history to have five consecutive number ones singles on Billboard Hot 100 from one album. In 2012, Katy Perry was honored with Billboard's second Spotlight award for being the second and first female artist in history to have five consecutive number ones singles on Billboard Hot 100 from one album.

The band from Gainesville, Florida, released its debut album in 1976. Notable songs on the album included ""American Girl"" and ""Breakdown.""  With his nasally voice and chiming guitar, Petty and his longtime band, the Heartbreakers, churned out an instantly recognizable brand of sturdy, heartland rock that made them a classic-radio staple for decades. Petty, along with the band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002  The group finished a summer tour with three performances at the Hollywood Bowl last week.  Petty and the Heartbreakers first came to fame in the 1970s. It was both with that group and as a solo artist that Petty had a string of hits across the decades, including ""Free Fallin',"" ""American Girl"" and ""I Won't Back Down.""

MUST WATCH Tom Petty's most memorable songs 01:24  Petty sang with Stevie Nicks that same year on her smash hit, ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around."" The duet kicked off a long and fruitful period of collaboration between Petty and other artists.  He recorded ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" -- memorable for its trippy, Mad Hatter-themed music video -- with the Eurythmics' Dave Stewart in 1985. Petty joined Bob Dylan on tour the next year, which also included dates with the Grateful Dead.  He joined fellow music legends Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison in 1988 to form The Traveling Wilburys. They released two studio albums.  It was a rich career for Petty, who was born in Gainesville, Florida and became hooked on rock and roll when -- at the age of 11 -- he met superstar Elvis Presley on a movie set.  Petty joined his first band, The Sundowners, in high school at the age of 14.  After getting into an argument with the band's drummer, Petty quit and moved on to join a group called The Epics, which included Tom Leadon, a brother of Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon.  ""We realized Tom was the real musician of the band,"" their fellow band member Rick Rucker told the Orlando Sentinel in 2006.  The Epics later changed their name to Mudcrutch, and Petty traveled to Los Angeles in search of a record deal for the rock quintet.  Despite landing a deal, the group soon disbanded.  A new group that included Petty and two former Mudcrutch members formed in 1975, eventually becoming known as Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  After pioneering the heartland rock sound, Petty went solo in 1989 before regrouping with the Heartbreakers three years later.  He also found fame as an actor. His flair for drama was on display in his music videos for songs like ""Mary Jane's Last Dance.""  Petty starred with Kevin Costner in the 1997 film, ""The Postman."" He also had a recurring role as the voice of Elroy ""Lucky"" Kleinschmidt in the animated comedy series, ""King of the Hill.""  A 2015 biography on Petty documented a dark turn for the singer and his struggle with heroin addiction in 1997, following the collapse of his 20-year marriage and a failed album.  ""Tried to go cold turkey, and that wouldn't work,"" Petty said in the book. ""It's an ugly f***ing thing.""  Petty told CNN in a 2007 interview that he loved music as much as it loved him.  ""Music, as far as I have seen in the world so far, is the only real magic that I know,"" he said. ""There is something really honest and clean and pure and it touches you in your heart.""",0

"Rosanna Arquette is spilling the beans on the one who got away.  The actress, 58, was on Thursday’s Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen where she was asked by a fan if she’d ever turned down a Hollywood star when her own was rising in the ’80s thanks to films like Desperately Seeking Susan and The Big Blue.

"508 Shares Share Tweet Pin Mail  At the time of filming Silver Linings Playbook Jennifer Lawrence portrayed a thirty-nine year old widow, but was herself barely old enough to drink legally in the US. Similarly, in Joy Lawrence played a women in her mid-forties, while in American Hustle she played a middle-aged love interest to a nearly forty year old Christian Bale. Strange as these casting decisions look, no one really noticed, let alone asked the burning question: why cast someone barely over her teens to play a woman in her mid-30s, especially when there are so very many talented older actresses sitting on the sidelines? It has become unheard of to cast an actual thirty-five year old to play a thirty-five year old onscreen. It would seem that pop culture is slowly killing off the adult female, effectively erasing any visual onscreen age differences between a woman pushing 20 and a woman pushing 40. The mature woman has all but disappeared from film.  It’s no secret that Hollywood has a serious problem with representation. There’s really only one way for a woman to look in Hollywood – white, usually blond, baby-faced and somewhere between 18 to 25 years old. There are no parts for actresses who fall outside of those absurdly narrow parameters. But it wasn’t always this way. During Hollywood’s Golden Age, starlets were revered for their woman-ness. There was a certain powerful comfort and elegance in their age that no amount of youthful charm could emulate. Back then it wasn’t about being sexy as much as it was about being sophisticated, and it’s harder to put an expiration date on sophistication. So, when did becoming a grown woman stop being aspirational? And what does this gaping representational void in the media mean for how we, as women, come to terms with the process of aging?  The age breakdown in Hollywood today goes something like this: If you’re a woman in her 20s, you’re good for pretty much any role (again, especially if you’re white and blonde). If you’re a woman in her 40s and 50s however, you’ll exclusively play grandmothers and witches, and if you’re unfortunate enough to be a woman in her 30s, you’re basically shit out of luck. As a 30-something year old actress you’re too young to play really old parts, and too old for everything else. In Hollywood it’s virtually unheard of for a 35 year old to actually play a 35 year old onscreen.  Why is a 40 year old man allowed to be merely human onscreen, while she must forever retain her mystical impossibility, a level of angel-like perfection only attainable by those who have only recently lost their baby teeth?  When at 28 years old Olivia Wilde auditioned for the role of Leonardo DiCaprio’s wife in Wolf of Wall Street, she was dismissed for being “too old” for the part, despite the fact that she was over a decade younger than Leo. The film’s producers chose to cast 22 year old Margot Robbie for the role instead. Scarlett Johansson was just 19 years old when she played a young married woman opposite 55 year old Bill Murray in Lost in Translation, while Maggie Gyllenhaal was, at 37 years old, turned down for a role because she was deemed “too old to play the lover of a man who was 55.”  We see this kind of age bias between leading men and their female costars literally everywhere. It’s business as usual…except, of course, for the young women who are essentially forced to play opposite men old enough to be their fathers. When 22 year old Kristen Stewart dropped her leading role in Focus because she was uncomfortable about the age difference between herself and her 44 year old co-star (and love interest) Will Smith, the news was completely dismissed. No one saw anything unusual about the onscreen pairing, nor did they note the disturbing ageist subtext in Stewart’s discomfort. It was business as usual in Hollywood.  What is the underlying message here? That strength and maturity of any kind in a woman isn’t sexy. That an aging woman has no value at all unless she remains fuckably innocent. That a woman older than 25 is no longer a woman at all, but an asexual phantom to be pitied for her loss of collagen rather than admired for any acting abilities. Why is a 40 year old man allowed to be merely human onscreen, crumpled and imperfect, while she must forever retain her mystical impossibility, a level of angel-like perfection only attainable by those who have only recently lost their baby teeth.  Katharine Hepburn was 42 years old when she played in Adam’s Rib, a romantic comedy with heavy feminist undertones that brought us lines like, “There are lots of things that a man can do and in society’s eyes, it’s all hunkey-dory, but when a woman does the same thing she’s an outcast.” Similarly, at the age of 50 Hepburn starred in Desk Set, a movie in which the actress was romantically pursued by two male leads. In both movies Hepburn not only plays a strong and well-rounded female protagonist, she embodies a wonderfully, glamorously, mature woman. Today, she would be deemed too old for both parts.  Similarly, Bette Davis was 34 years old when she gave birth to the makeover genre in Now Voyager (1942). In the film Davis’s transformation goes far beyond the typical stereotypes we usually associate with the genre today. Her metamorphosis from insecure girl to confident self-possessed woman truly embodies what it means to grow older, stand up to those who try to dominate you and take control over your own life. Her’s is the kind of character that shows how age can come with it’s own brand of personal power, and it’s precisely the kind of character we never see in film anymore. If Now, Voyager were filmed and cast today, the lead would very likely be played by a teenager.  Today, women in their late 30s and beyond are slowly fading from view. We don’t see them in starring roles, we don’t see them on ads and they’re certainly not opening any shows at fashion week. If we were to go on media presence alone, you would have to assume that women showing any signs of aging whatsoever are more offensive than even the worst kind of violence. The latter gets way more airtime in film and advertising. And in this too representation is critically important because studies reveal that humans are by nature more aggressive towards the things they do not recognize as familiar. One of the best ways to reset the way people feel about anything is to change the way that thing is represented in the media  Women over 40 make up 39 percent of the total female adult population in the United States. Ignoring them is like manufacturers choosing to produce shoes up to size 6, or restaurants only serving baby formula. Given the staggering market size, it’s impossible to chalk this industry-wide casting aside of older women to anything other than cruelly sexist beauty standards.  And it doesn’t stop in Hollywood either. If you’re very young it’s a question of who you’re going to grow into, and how you will feel when you inhabit your own skin on your 30th birthday. And if you’re already over 30, it’s about the creeping feeling that human beings who look like you are already fading from view. By consistently casting extremely young actresses to play mature women we are not only infantaizing women and eroticizing that infancy, not to mention setting extremely negative expectations for what mid-life should look like for a woman. Even Jennifer Lawrence herself won’t be immune to this kind of ageism, and will be phased out of the best roles by the time she is 31.  There are approximately 97 million people over the age of 44 in America. Women in that age group make up 39 percent of the total female adult population in the United States. Ignoring them is like manufacturers choosing to only produce shoes up to a size 6, or restaurants only serving baby formula. Given that staggering market size of women over 40, it’s impossible to chalk this industry-wide casting aside of older women to anything other than cruelly sexist beauty standards.  So how did we get here? There simply aren’t enough female decision-makers in Hollywood. Everyone from the producers to the casting directors is predominantly male, and male Hollywood executives are not exactly tuned into the needs of their female demographic. Unless they’re filming a romance, the target audience is predominantly male. Consider the last time you saw a movie starring middle aged women making important world-altering decisions, like in The Big Short, or going on epic adventures, like in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, or being badass and fighting evil, like in the James Bond films, or just doing a bunch of really cool risky shit like in Ocean’s 11. By and large, women are the arm candy, they’re not in the movie to make important decisions, or save anyone, they’re there to look good. That’s it.  We need new role models…hell, as I get older I need new role models. I need to see actors like Ingrid Bergman and Katharine Hepburn, I want to see stories told about the lives of women beyond their quarter-life crisis years. I need to feel like, the more distance life puts between me and the day I was born the more, not less relevant I become. It’s a scary feeling knowing that you’ve come so far only to become culturally invisible simply because Hollywood deems women your age unsexy.  To age, to mature, to grow into your skin is part of the process of becoming the person you were always meant to be. By diverting precious energy from that natural growth process to focus instead on maintaining any semblance of youth, you sacrifice a critical sense of self. This is the natural trajectory of identity formation. We all start off as clean slates, moldable, open to suggestion, only to become more and more truly ourselves as we age, shedding our naiveté and childish passivity along with our youth. In the words of Amy Poehler, “It takes years for a woman to unlearn what you have been taught to feel sorry for.”  A fully formed mature woman is at the peak of her sense of self. She is literally the best self she will ever be – she is less likely to be pushed around, she knows what she needs to be happy and how to negotiate for those things. What are we telling young women when we suppress this incredibly vibrant and important phase in a woman’s life, writing it off as unimportant because of, what, a few wrinkles?  I know there’s this collective itch to write all this off as unimportant (it’s just Hollywood, let’s just all chill out) but the stories we produce as a culture are incredibly powerful. Our stories give us a sense of identity as a species. Without them we have no history, no sense of place, and no sense of destiny. Think about it. The only reason we know to aspire to anything at all is because of the stories we’ve been told about regular people who, against all odds, built an extraordinary life for themselves. The only reason you love what you love, (art, fashion, entrepreneurship, graphic design etc) is because somewhere along the way, you heard or saw a story about it that touched your heart.  Our stories matter more than many of us realize. They help shape our reality. And it’s vital that we hear the stories of all kinds of people, the young and old, rich and poor, the ordinary and the extraordinary. As it stands today, Hollywood tells only one story: that the most exciting things only happen to men, that being a grown woman means being culturally irrelevant, that a man can be anything he damn well wants to be, but a woman’s whole existential worth hinges on her fuckability, and that with age a woman ceases to matter at all. There are so many stories still left to be told.  508 Shares Share Tweet Pin Mail",1

"Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani and have no engagement and only hunt, despite a new report. Gossip Cop can handle this story exclusively. A representative confirms that the allegations are both wrong and fabricated.  Hollywood Life allegedly claims to have ""exclusive details"" about how Stefani and Shelton ""could renounce an engagement and make the covenant."" A so-called ""source close to Gwen"" is quoted as saying: ""They talk about it all the time and that's how they live together [sic] as if they were already married."" This alleged snitch goes on to say, ""With her busy deadline, Gwen even talked to Blake about skipping the engagement and instead just one Beach or somewhere in the country to loft, if the romantic mood is right. ""  Obviously, the site is unaware that a couple can be engaged and still run away, so these claims make no sense. In the sense of Dictionary.com ""elope"" means ""secretly run away to be married"". It does not exclude an engagement. It rather means marriage, which is held without knowledge or participation of other people. Of course, this is more than just terminology.  While the blog claims that the performers could ""skip"" an engagement, she has already spread several stories about her becoming engaged. If you look at just the last year, there are at least four stories that contradict this current narrative (see screengrabs of the headlines below). For example, in May 2017, the website claimed that Stefani wanted Shelton to suggest that she use her ""The Voice"" downtime to plan a wedding. By October, the store speculated that the country superstar had ""secretly suggested"" and they were engaged after Stefani was seen in a ""giant diamond ring"".  Then in December, there was an article by HollywoodLies, as he's called ""They'll never marry if they're not engaged in 2018"" and continue to say, ""If there's no ring on Gwen's finger by the end of the new year, the couple can take the marriage forever off the table. "" This latest piece, the ""source"" mentioned, calls the marriage between Shelton and Stefani ""inevitable."" That's not all. In February, the site claimed Shelton was shopping for a diamond ring, which was to be used in a ""Valentine's Day Proposal"".  Valentine's Day has clearly come and gone without any suggestion, so HollywoodLies is now pretending it has never made such an assertion or any of the others, so it may offer this new tale to ""skip"" an engagement. But journalism does not work in a vacuum. Consistency shows credibility. And the blog's own story shows that it's not believable. It is also noteworthy that HollywoodLies first alleged Shelton and Stefani broke through in 2015. A similar claim was made last November, and they still did. This also shows that the website is untrustworthy.  And that's not all. A few days ago, the outlet uncovered a false cover story Life & Style about Stefani, who is not just pregnant, but is also planning a wedding in Mexico that will feature celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston. This new ""Exclusive"" does not mention pregnancy and does not explain what happened to the supposed plans for a star wedding. Regardless of whether the publication claims there will be a wedding or a secret ceremony, HollywoodLies is still wrong. Less than a month ago, it was reported that Stefani and Shelton are unwilling to marry and are so happy with their relationship.  So, both scenarios are wrong: They're not planning a big wedding or talking about Eloping. Stefani's representative already said Gossip Cop earlier this week that the wedding (and pregnancy) allegations were ""untrue"" and now the spokesman confirmed to us that this new story is fake and fake. On the basis of all the evidence sketched here by Gossip Cop that should be very clear.",1
"Embed from Getty Images  One of my most shameful celebrity “crushes” is Diplo. Go ahead and yell at me, I deserve it. You can tell me anything about Diplo too, I know he’s a total douchebag. I can’t help it though – there’s something about his smug doucheface that I find appealing or hot or something. Sometimes we can’t always explain why we’re attracted to someone. But I would hit it and then I would never tell a soul about it, because banging Diplo is and always should be a shameful secret. Since he’s my shame-crush, I know that he likes women who are pretty young too, which is also gross. Apparently, he was possibly spending time with none other than Kendall Jenner at Coachella. Ugh.  Kendall Jenner is no stranger to getting up close and personal with music’s biggest names. The model has dated the likes of Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky — and now I hear she may have Diplo set in her sights. My spies caught Kendall looking extremely close with the US producer— who counts Katy Perry as an ex — at a Coachella bash on Friday. They set tongues wagging after spending lots of time with each other at the party which was thrown to celebrate the launch of a cosmetics brand headed by ­Kendall’s sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. My source at the Palm Springs bash told me: “Kendall and Diplo were super-flirty at the party. There was lots of touching and some extended hugging. They both appeared to be comfortable and familiar in each other’s company and hanging off everything the other ­person said. Diplo was ­stroking her arm. They were in great spirits. Kendall was toasting the launch of her show on Apple Music radio station Beats 1 while Diplo did a DJ set. It was the talk of the bash. Everyone ­wondered whether there could be something more going on between them.” The pair’s flirting comes amid an ongoing saga in Kendall’s love life. Last weekend, it was reported she ignored rumoured love interest Blake Griffin when they both attended a different bash at the musical festival in California. At the party — thrown by Hollywood night spot Bootsy Bellows and McDonald’s — basketball star Blake walked straight past ­Kendall and the two did not speak the whole night. But, on Thursday, they both had dinner at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood — although they made sure they were not snapped arriving together. A source added: “Kendall has a lot of male interest and isn’t keen to be tied down in a serious relationship. Diplo is an extremely eligible catch and she seemed very ­flattered at the attention he was showing her.” I also hear Kendall is being paid around £450,000 per ­episode to co-host her new monthly radio show Pizza Boys. Should Diplo decide to pop round for a takeaway, they can afford to splash out on a few side dishes.  [From The Sun]  I’m sure some of you will be like “Kendall wasn’t flirting with Diplo because she’s gay.” First of all, lesbians flirt with men all the time. Secondly, Kendall recently spoke about the lesbian rumors which have surrounded her for years, and I tend to believe her on this one thing: if she was gay or bisexual, she would just BE gay or bisexual. It’s not like her family is super-conservative or anti-LGBTQ. She would talk about it and date women openly and it would not be a big deal at all. I think it’s more than likely she’s a straight woman with a masculine energy. I also think it’s likely that she’s the most “quiet” about her love life among the sisters. So… basically, I sort of believe this. I think Diplo and Kendall Jenner hooked up at Coachella. I doubt it’s true love. And she’s probably ashamed of herself and she’ll never tell a soul about the hookup because, again, Diplo is gross (and so f–king hot).  Also: Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall look like twins to me.

"After the horror film opened to astounding numbers at the box office, Corden evoked fear as the co-worker from hell in a spoof on his late-night show.  James Corden parodied John Krasinski and Emily Blunt's horror film, A Quiet Place, during a Wednesday night sketch on The Late Late Show. In A Quiet Late Late, Corden plays an annoying co-worker who will barge in on group activities if he hears the slightest sound.  ""If he hears you, he will join you,"" the trailer warns. Indeed, when Corden hears the sound of a Late Late Show employee biting into a chip in the breakroom, he joins his colleagues for lunch, much to their dismay. Not only does Corden steal their fries, but he incites major eye rolls when he gleefully shows off his new fidget-spinner.  Later, things get a bit more intense when his co-workers play a silent game of Monopoly — directly referencing a scene from A Quiet Place — and an employee can't help but cheer out loud when he wins the game. ""Maybe he didn't hear,"" another player whispers in fear, just before Corden pops up out of nowhere.  ""You guys playing Monopoly? I love Monopoly!"" he says, completely unaware of how unwanted his presence is. ""I'll be the thimble. You guys here the whole time? I didn't even hear you.""  At the end of the clip, a co-worker's phone rings and it only takes seconds before Corden finds him. That's when the employee discovers Corden's weakness: physical exertion. ""He will force you to include him,"" states the trailer. ""Unless you run away.""  After a short sprint, Corden gives up, saying, ""I'll catch up with you later. We had fun! That's a fun game.""  Corden's take on A Quiet Place comes after the movie made more than $50 million over the weekend. In the film, which has earned rave reviews, Krasinski and his wife, Blunt, play a couple who live in isolation with their two children. In order to avoid being killed by spider-like monsters who are acutely attracted to sound, they make a concerted attempt to never make any noise.  The project marks Krasinski’s first screenplay and his third directorial effort since he and Blunt got married in 2010. The Paramount Pictures feature was recently cleared by China's censors and secured a release date (May 18), which is rare for a horror film in the communist country.",0

"Ben Affleck is keeping life with his three kids and his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus separate, if Jennifer Garner has anything to say about it.  “Jen doesn’t want the kids around Lindsay or having her in their lives. She has many reasons,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.  Though the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck’s filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is “the fact that Ben had an affair with her.”  However, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, “Ben understands and has honored her request.”  “They’re good friends,” the source adds. “She wants him to be honest and he usually is. She tends to find out about things, and Ben is very open with her. They both want what’s best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.”  While the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck’s past struggles with alcohol abuse.  “The one thing she’s not flexible on is sobriety,” the source tells Us. “Jen is hesitant to sign off until she’s certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time. Finalizing the divorce has been a long process because of it.”  For more on Garner and Affleck’s post-divorce relationship, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

"Since everyone's suddenly talking about Oprah 2020, let's talk about what her campaign might look like — or more specifically, what her opponents might do to it.  There's no reason to think politics will become any less brutal in the next two years. And there's every reason to expect that opposition researchers would happily dig through Oprah Winfrey's storied history as a talk-show host, cultural icon, fake book promoter, advocate of mystical healing powers, fearer of hamburgers and apparent chum of Harvey Weinstein.  Not to mention the child sex abuse scandal.  [Oprah for president in 2020? Here’s everything you need to know.]  Here's a sampling of the awkward and potentially problematic issues that Winfrey might have to explain on the campaign trail.  Oprah and the child sex abuse scandal  Remember the headache the defunct Trump University became for its namesake during his campaign? Some might prefer to forget the cascading disasters of the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls.  Winfrey called the sprawling, $40-million complex her “gift” to poor South African girls when it opened in 2007 — complete with a yoga studio and beauty salon. She initially had to defend the luxurious complex against accusations that it looked elitist in a country wracked by poverty.  She defended the school in her typical heartwarming style: “If you are surrounded by beautiful things and wonderful teachers who inspire you, that beauty brings out the beauty in you,” Winfrey told reporters before the grand opening.  The girls had “never been told they are pretty or have wonderful dimples,” she said. “I wanted to hear those things as a child.”  Several months later, a dorm matron was arrested and accused of sexually abusing at least half- a-dozen seventh- and eighth-graders.  Oprah was reportedly heartbroken. She cried for half an hour, she told reporters in a news conference after the matron's arrest. She accused school officials of covering up the scandal. They told the girls to “put on happy faces,” Winfrey said.  She dismissed the head mistress and promised to clean house at the academy.  But less than two years later, with the dorm matron's trial still pending, several girls were suspended or expelled after accusations that they tried to force other students into sexual and romantic relationships.  And then the original accusations began to unravel.  The next year, the Guardian reported, Oprah settled with the headmistress, who had accused her of defamation by suggesting that she knew of the dorm matron's actions.  A few months after that, the dorm matron was acquitted of all charges, the Guardian wrote. A judge had found the girls' accusations self-contradictory and not credible.  The matron told reporters that her life had been ruined. She was broke, unemployed and said she didn't know if she could ever forgive Winfrey, who continued to stand by the girls' accusations.  The academy continues to operate. It recently celebrated its 10th anniversary with a scandal-free story in Variety, which notes Winfrey's advice for the girls: “I want you to be president of your own life.”  Oprah turned a cancer patient on to junk science  If Winfrey becomes president, she would have enormous influence over American health care, including nominating the surgeon general and health secretary.  She's already selected “America's doctor.” That's Winfrey's term for Mehmet Oz, better known as Dr. Oz on her show, where he became famous for dispensing health advice in the mid-2000s — including the classic segment, “Everybody Poops.”  Today, as The Washington Post wrote, Oz has his own show and may be the country's most influential physician. And he regularly uses that influence to promote treatments with no scientific basis, including, literally, “magic” beans.  Oz may not necessarily be politically toxic — Trump appeared on his show during the 2016 campaign — but he's become a pariah in the medical community. Winfrey booted him from her media network two years ago after a group of physicians accused him of “quack treatments.”  Nor is he the only accused quack Winfrey has embraced: As the Guardian wrote, she's been blamed for boosting Jenny McCarthy's anti-vaccine crusade. And Winfrey has repeatedly plugged a mystical self-help system called “The Secret,” which claims that thinking good thoughts (and buying DVDs) can cure emotional, financial and physical problems.  Winfrey's first show about “The Secret” helped make a believer of Kim Tinkham, who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. She told Winfrey in 2007 that the system had inspired her to ignore her doctors, who told her she needed immediate surgery and treatment. “I've decided to heal myself,” Tinkham said.  Winfrey tried to talk her out of it. “I'm really happy the message, or certainly some of the message, is reaching mass consciousness,” she said. But Tinkham could think healing thoughts and still get a partial mastectomy.  The Washington Examiner reported that Tinkham died three years later.  Oprah caused a hamburger panic  Most people assume Winfrey — a backer of former president Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton — would run as a Democrat. So she'd certainly need to win California, or Texas if she somehow ran as a Republican. Both happen to be big beef states. The latter was also the site of Winfrey's infamous beef lawsuit.  It began with an episode of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in 1996, amid widespread fears of so-called mad cow disease, a potentially fatal illness that humans can catch by eating certain organs of infected cattle.  Though the disease's spread had actually peaked a few years earlier, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Winfrey brought a vegetarian activist onto her show — and this happened:  “You said this disease could make AIDS look like the common cold,” Winfrey told the activist, according to the Associated Press.  “Absolutely,” the activist replied.  “It has just stopped me from eating another burger!” Winfrey exclaimed, and her audience applauded.  Ranchers said beef prices crashed to a 10-year-low the next day.  “Oprah accused of whipping up anti-beef ‘lynch mob,’ ” CNN reported two years later, after a group of ranchers sued Winfrey under a Texas law against making “disparaging statements about perishable food products.”  A judge later downgraded the case to a defamation suit, but Winfrey was forced to relocate her show to Amarillo, where her fans packed the street outside the courtroom during the 1998 trial.  A jury eventually decided that Winfrey had not been trying to sabotage the beef industry. Her fans drank champagne outside the courthouse, and the talk show host refused once again to eat a burger.  Meat lovers remembered the spectacle for decades. “Why Does Oprah Continue to Bully Beef?” Beef Magazine wrote several years ago, and accused Winfrey of using her magazine to publish a hit piece against factory farms, of which the swing states boast more than a few.    Oprah Winfrey smiles after a jury rejected a lawsuit by Texas cattlemen, who claimed Winfrey's televised comments about mad cow disease caused the beef market to plummet and cost them millions of dollars. (Lm Otero/AP)  Oprah defended a fake book  With the beef wars behind her, Winfrey returned to her staple brand of positivity, sometimes tinged with tragedy.  In fall 2005, she brought author James Frey onto her show, who had written a harrowing memoir about overcoming alcohol and drug addiction.  “If you've ever had to live through this with somebody you love, here is a story that was written for you,” Winfrey told her viewers.  The rest of the segment was filled with passages from Frey's book, “A Million Little Pieces”:  Frey regaining consciousness in an airplane with no memory and missing teeth; Frey getting dental surgery without anesthesia; Frey freebasing cocaine and “snort[ing] glue.”  “I heave and it comes,” Frey recited from the book. “The burning vomit comes and comes again and again and again.”  Winfrey enthusiastically recommended “A Million Little Pieces” for her book club. It sold more than 2 million copies over the next two months, the New York Times reported.  Then reporters looked into Frey's stories and forced him to admit that he'd made many of them up.  Where he had written about getting high, driving a car into a police officer, fighting with the officer and spending three months in jail, police said, Frey had actually run his tire over a curb and politely paid bail for driving under the influence, CNN reported.  Where Frey wrote of being blamed for a teenager's fatal car accident, The Post wrote, the girl's parents could recall nothing of it.  Winfrey stood by the author, even after he admitted to exaggerating many stories. “What is relevant is that he was a drug addict who spent years in turmoil,” she told Larry King. “It seems to be much ado about nothing.”  Now critics turned on Winfrey, too. A Washington Post writer called her “deluded.” After a few days of humiliation, she invited Frey back on her show and, by common consensus, absolutely shredded him.  “You conned us all,” she told the squirming author. “That's a lie. It's not an idea, James. That's a lie.”  Still, the scandal did not end. The next year, Winfrey was back on King's show, denying that she had cruelly “annihilated” the author she once built up. In 2011, more than five years after the initial plug, Winfrey invited Frey onto her show yet again and apologized to him “for my lack of compassion.”  Some noted at the time that Frey had a new book coming out.  Oprah thinks some Americans need to die  Winfrey was promoting her most recent film, “The Butler,” in 2013 when she talked to the BBC about racism. The original interview seems to have disappeared online, but some of her words will live on:  “There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism,” Winfrey said, according to MSNBC. “And they just have to die.”  Her logic was celebrated by some — “Oprah Joins the Long Line of People Waiting for Old Racists to Die,” for example.  But right-leaning sites accused her of playing race politics to sell movie tickets.  Anticipating the deaths of any potential voters, even old racists, can't lend itself to a positive presidential campaign.  Oprah palled around with Harvey Weinstein  Speaking of “The Butler,” it was co-produced by Harvey Weinstein, the movie mogul now accused of serial sexual assault. His fall from grace last year helped expose a culture of predation on women in Hollywood and inspired Winfrey's Golden Globes speech, which may in turn launch her presidential campaign.  But Weinstein's behavior was reportedly an open secret in the industry, which might make all the photos of Winfrey schmoozing around with him a political problem.  Conservatives are already gleefully cataloguing the pictures.  Unlike with Frey, Winfrey at least never publicly defended Weinstein after the accusations went public. Rather, she condemned his “hideous behavior.”  Still, her spokesman had to deny a TMZ report that Winfrey urged Weinstein to defend himself against the scandal. And in November, actress Kadian Noble told reporters that Weinstein had seduced her, in part, by introducing her to Winfrey and Naomi Campbell.  This led to a headline on Page Six: “Weinstein used Oprah and Naomi to seduce me.”  Fair or not, that's the stuff attack ads are made of.

"[Photo by: Netflix]  Stranger Things actor Charlie Heaton is opening up about the reported drug possession that stymied the Netflix star late last year, the presence of cocaine on his luggage preventing him from attending the show's Season 2 premiere.  Read more: 'Stranger Things' fields harassment allegations  Heaton, a British citizen, was denied entry into the U.S. last October, as reported by USA Today. Although he wasn't arrested and no charges were filed, officers at Los Angeles International Airport detected a small amount of cocaine on the actor's belongings after a routine inspection by a customs canine. Heaton, who plays Jonathan Byers on Stranger Things, was returned to London and missed out on the show's L.A. premiere event for the second season.  The actor now says the incident is “all sorted,” and he reveals to Flaunt magazine that the public scrutiny he received over the experience was “fucking awful,” as noted by the NME. Hearton admits that his newfound fame from Stranger Things served as an impediment in relation to the drug debacle:  “It was hard,” he says. “Everything happened so fast, and I hadn't come to terms with the fact that I was famous. When something steps in from the work you are doing and breaks into your personal life…you feel kind of vulnerable. All of a sudden it becomes a very big story and it gets really blown out of proportion.” After reporters showed up on his parents' doorstep in Yorkshire, England, the actor says he “just wanted to go back. I want to work and continue to work.”  At the time of the cocaine possession reports, Heaton released an official statement admitting that he was “sorry to all the fans and my Stranger Things family for missing the premiere. We are all so proud of this season and I would never want this story to negatively impact the show.”  The actor's expected to return as Jonathan Byers for the upcoming third season of Stranger Things.

"Remy Ma reignited her feud with Nicki Minaj at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday (Aug. 27), where she delivered a familiar message for her “shETHER” target.  While teasing an upcoming segment alongside Terrence J, the “All the Way Up” rapper reused a line that Minaj once directed at Miley Cyrus at the 2015 VMAs. “Nicki, what’s good?” she asked with a smile.  Fans quickly saw this as adding fuel to the beef fire, but Nicki was also on the attack. To close out the show, the YMCMB rapper fired off her scathing diss verse as part of Katy Perry’s basketball-themed “Swish Swish” performance.  “Silly rap beefs just get me more checks,” she raps on the track. “Swish, swish, all my haters is obsessed / ‘Cause I make Ms, they get much less.”  Following subliminal lyrics from both sides, Remy Ma sparked the public feud in February 2017, when she released “shETHER,” a song that made no attempts to hide animosity. Shortly after that, she followed up with a second shot with “Another One.”  After challenging Remy to “drop a hit,” Nicki responded to these verbal taunts with “No Frauds” and “Changed It”. Since then, the two seemed to continue going back and forth, despite claims that the beef is over.",0
"Production has been suspended on the sixth and final season of Netflix's House of Cards amid the Kevin Spacey sexual assault scandal.    Deadline reports that Netflix and producer Media Rights Capital told them: “MRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on House of Cards season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew.""    This comes after Monday's news that show would end next year for its sixth season, and just before that, actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of sexual assault when he was 14-years-old in 1986.    Production on the sixth season had already begun prior to this all.    In another statement yesterday about the Spacey allegations, the two companies said, ""Media Rights Capital and Netflix are deeply troubled by last night’s news concerning Kevin Spacey.""    House of Cards, considered to be one of the biggest moments in the careers of Spacey and Robin Wright (also increased the visibility of Mahershala Ali in mainstream entertainment) was Netflix's first major original series production, setting the stage for what we know now to be the game-changing streaming giant.    Hollywood has seen a ""floodgate"" of accusations, with victims coming forward speaking about their stories after the Harvey Weinstein debacle.",0

For the British jazz, rock and house music singer, see Juliet Roberts  Julia Fiona Roberts (born October 28, 1967)[1] is an American actress and producer. She became a Hollywood star after headlining the romantic comedy Pretty Woman (1990), which grossed $464 million worldwide. She has won three Golden Globe Awards (out of eight nominations) and has been nominated for four Academy Awards for her film acting, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Erin Brockovich (2000).  Her films have collectively brought box office receipts of over US$2.8 billion, making her one of the most successful actresses in terms of box office receipts.[2] Her most successful films include Mystic Pizza (1988), Steel Magnolias (1989), Pretty Woman (1990), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), The Pelican Brief (1993), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Notting Hill (1999), Runaway Bride (1999), Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004), Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Valentine's Day (2010), Eat Pray Love (2010), Money Monster (2016), and Wonder (2017). Roberts was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014).  Roberts was the highest-paid actress in the world throughout most of the 1990s[3][4] and in the first half of the 2000s.[5] Her fee for 1990's Pretty Woman was US$300,000;[6] in 2003, she was paid an unprecedented $25 million for her role in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). As of 2007 Roberts's net worth was estimated to be $140 million.[7] She has been named the world's most beautiful woman by People a record five times.  Early life and family [ edit ]  Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia,[1][8] to Betty Lou Bredemus (1934–2015) and Walter Grady Roberts (1933–1977).[1][8][9] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.[10][11] Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Roman Catholic,[12] and she was raised Catholic.[13][14] Her older brother, Eric Roberts, from whom she was estranged for several years until 2004, sister Lisa Roberts Gillan, and niece Emma Roberts, are also actors.  Roberts' parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing in theatrical productions for the armed forces. They later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta, off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children's acting school in Decatur, Georgia, while they were expecting Julia. The children of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King attended the school; Walter Roberts was their daughter Yolanda Denise King's acting coach.[15] As a thank-you for his service, Mrs. King paid Mrs. Roberts's hospital bill when Julia was born.[16]  Her parents married in 1955. Her mother filed for divorce in 1971; the divorce was finalized in early 1972.[17] From 1972, Roberts lived in Smyrna, Georgia, where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School, and Campbell High School.[18] In 1972, her mother married Michael Motes, who was abusive and often unemployed; Roberts despised him.[19] The couple had a daughter, Nancy Motes, who died at 37 on February 9, 2014, of an apparent drug overdose.[20] The marriage ended in 1983, with Betty Lou divorcing Motes on cruelty grounds; she had stated that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life.[19] Roberts's own father died of cancer when she was ten.[21]  Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child.[22] She also played the clarinet in her school band.[23][24] After graduating from Smyrna's Campbell High School, she attended Georgia State University but did not graduate. She later headed to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting classes.[25][26]  Acting career [ edit ]  1980s [ edit ]  Roberts made her first big screen appearance in the film Satisfaction (1988), alongside Liam Neeson and Justine Bateman, as a band member looking for a summer gig. She had previously performed a small role opposite her brother Eric, in Blood Red (she has two words of dialogue), filmed in 1987, although it was not released until 1989. Her first television appearance was as a juvenile rape victim in the initial season of the series Crime Story with Dennis Farina, in the episode titled ""The Survivor"", broadcast on February 13, 1987. Her first critical success with moviegoers was her performance in the independent film Mystic Pizza in 1988;[27] that same year, she had a role in the fourth-season finale of Miami Vice. In 1989, she was featured in Steel Magnolias, as a young bride with diabetes, and received both her first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actress) and first Golden Globe Award win (Motion Picture Best Supporting Actress) for her performance.[27]  1990s [ edit ]  Roberts became known to worldwide audiences when she starred with Richard Gere in the Cinderella/Pygmalionesque story, Pretty Woman, in 1990.[27] Roberts won the role after Michelle Pfeiffer, Molly Ringwald, Meg Ryan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Karen Allen, and Daryl Hannah (her co-star in Steel Magnolias) turned it down.[28] The role also earned her a second Oscar nomination, this time as Best Actress, and second Golden Globe Award win, as Motion Picture Best Actress (Musical or Comedy).[27] Her next box office success was the thriller Sleeping with the Enemy, playing a battered wife who escapes her abusive husband, played by Patrick Bergin, and begins a new life in Iowa. She played Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg's Hook in 1991, and also played a nurse in the 1991 film, Dying Young. This work was followed by a two-year hiatus, during which she made no films other than a cameo appearance in Robert Altman's The Player (1992). In early 1993, she was the subject of a People magazine cover story asking, ""What Happened to Julia Roberts?""[29] She was offered the role of Annie Reed in Sleepless in Seattle (1993), but turned it down.[30]  Roberts co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Pelican Brief (1993), based on John Grisham's 1992 novel of the same name.[27] In 1996, she appeared in season 2 of Friends (episode 13 ""The One After the Superbowl"").[31] She had a relationship with cast member Matthew Perry at the time.[32][33][34][35] According to an audience member, Roberts said to Perry about their on-screen kiss, ""I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend.""[36] She was offered the role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz in While You Were Sleeping (1995), but turned it down.[30]  Roberts co-starred with Liam Neeson in Michael Collins (1996).[27] That same year, she starred in Stephen Frears' Mary Reilly, which was a commercial failure. In 1997, however, she enjoyed renewed success with the romantic comedy My Best Friend's Wedding. In 1998, she appeared on Sesame Street opposite the character Elmo, demonstrating her ability to change emotions. She was offered the role of Viola de Lesseps in Shakespeare in Love (1998) but turned it down.[30] She starred in the films Stepmom (1998), alongside Susan Sarandon,[37] Notting Hill (1999), with Hugh Grant, and, also in 1999, in Runaway Bride, her second film with Richard Gere. Roberts was a guest star on the Law & Order television series episode ""Empire"" with series regular Benjamin Bratt (at that time her boyfriend). She earned a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.[38]  2000s [ edit ]  In 2000, she played the lead role of real-life environmental activist Erin Brockovich in the film Erin Brockovich.  In December 2000, Roberts, who had been the highest-paid actress through the 1990s, became the first actress to make The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 50 most influential women in show business since the list had begun in 1992.[3]  In 2001, Roberts received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Erin Brockovich. Roberts' acceptance speech for the award went over the allowed time limit but did not mention the real-life Brockovich, for which Roberts later apologized, saying she forgot.[39] While presenting the Best Actor Award to Denzel Washington the following year, Roberts made a gaffe, saying she was glad that Tom Conti wasn't there; she meant the conductor, Bill Conti, who had tried to hasten the conclusion of her Oscar speech the previous year, but instead named the Scottish actor.[40]  Roberts' first film following Erin Brockovich was the road gangster comedy, The Mexican, giving her a chance to work with long-time friend Brad Pitt. The film's script was originally intended to be filmed as an independent production without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to sign on. Though advertised as a typical romantic comedy star vehicle, the film does not focus solely on the Pitt/Roberts relationship and the two shared relatively little screen time together. The Mexican earned $66.8 million at the U.S. box office.[41] Later in 2001, she starred in the romantic comedy America's Sweethearts along with Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Joe Roth, the Hollywood farce centers on a supercouple, Gwen and Eddie, who separate when she dumps him for another man. Roberts portrayed Gwen's once-overweight sister and assistant who has been secretly in love with Eddie (Cusack) for years. Reviews of the film were generally unfavorable: critics' felt that despite its famous cast, the movie lacked ""sympathetic characters"" and was ""only funny in spurts.""[42] A commercial success, it grossed over US$138 million worldwide, however.[43]  In fall 2001, Roberts teamed with Erin Brockovich director Steven Soderbergh for Ocean's Eleven, a comedy-crime caper film and remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name, featuring an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. Roberts played Tess Ocean, the ex-wife of leader Danny Ocean (Clooney), originally played by Angie Dickinson, who is dating a casino owner played by Andy García. In preparation for her role, Roberts studied Dickinson's performance by watching the original film at least seven times in order to get her part right.[44] A success with critics and at the box office alike, Ocean's Eleven became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year with a total of US$450 million worldwide.[45]  In 2003, Roberts was cast in Mike Newell's drama film Mona Lisa Smile, also starring Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Julia Stiles. Roberts received a record US$25 million for her portrayal of a forward-thinking art history professor at Wellesley College in 1953 – the highest ever earned by an actress until then.[46] The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics, who found it ""predictable and safe"".[47]  In 2004, Roberts replaced Cate Blanchett in Mike Nichols's Closer, a romantic drama film written by Patrick Marber, based on his award-winning 1997 play of the same name.[48] The film also starred Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.[48] Also in 2004, she reprised the role of Tess Ocean in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. The film was deliberately much more unconventional than the first, epitomized by a sequence in which Roberts' character impersonates the real-life Julia Roberts, due to what the film's characters believe is their strong resemblance.[49] Though less well reviewed than Eleven, the film became another major success at the box office, with a gross of US$363 million worldwide, mostly from its international run.[50] Unlike all the male cast members, Roberts did not appear in the series' third and final installment, Ocean's Thirteen (2007), due to script issues.[51] In 2005, she was featured in the music video for the single ""Dreamgirl"" by the Dave Matthews Band; it was her first music video appearance.[52]  Roberts appeared in The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 10 highest-paid actresses every year from 2002 (when the magazine began compiling its list) to 2005.[5]  Eat Pray Love, September 2010 Roberts in Paris promoting, September 2010  Roberts had two films released in 2006: The Ant Bully and Charlotte's Web. Both films were animated features for which she provided voice acting.[53][54] Her next film was Charlie Wilson's War (2007), with Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by Mike Nichols; it was released on December 21, 2007.[55] Fireflies in the Garden (2008), also starring Ryan Reynolds and Willem Dafoe, was released at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2008 and was subsequently shown in European cinemas; it did not get a North American release until 2011.[56]  Roberts made her Broadway debut on April 19, 2006, as Nan in a revival of Richard Greenberg's 1997 play Three Days of Rain opposite Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd. Although the play grossed nearly US$1 million in ticket sales during its first week[57] and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, her performance drew criticism. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described Roberts as being fraught with ""self-consciousness (especially in the first act) [and] only glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays.""[58] Brantley also criticized the overall production, writing that ""it's almost impossible to discern its artistic virtues from this wooden and splintered interpretation, directed by Joe Mantello.""[58] Writing in the New York Post, Clive Barnes declared, ""Hated the play. To be sadly honest, even hated her. At least I liked the rain—even if three days of it can seem an eternity.""[59]  In 2009, Lancôme announced that Roberts would become their global ambassador for their company.[60]  2010s [ edit ]  Roberts at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival  Roberts starred with Clive Owen in the comedy-thriller Duplicity for which she received her seventh Golden Globe nomination.

At the time, Moder was married to Vera Steimberg. He filed for divorce a little over a year later, and after it was finalized, he and Roberts wed on July 4, 2002,[89] at her ranch in Taos, New Mexico.[90] Together, they have three children: twins Hazel Patricia and Phinnaeus Walter Moder (born November 28, 2004)[91] and son, Henry Daniel Moder (born June 18, 2007).[92]  Religious beliefs [ edit ]  Deployed troops show Roberts the controls of an F-15  In 2010, Roberts disclosed, in an interview for Elle magazine that she believes in and practices Hinduism.[93] Roberts is a devotee of the guru Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaj-ji), a picture of whom drew Roberts to Hinduism.[94]  In September 2009, Swami Daram Dev of Ashram Hari Mandir in Pataudi, where Roberts was shooting Eat Pray Love, gave her children new names after Hindu gods: Laxmi for Hazel, Ganesh for Phinnaeus and Krishna Balram for Henry.[95]  Charities [ edit ]  Roberts has given her time and resources to UNICEF as well as to other charitable organizations.

Fonsi co-wrote the song with Alejandro Rengifo and its producers Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo.[1] It was released through Universal Music Latin Entertainment, Republic Records and Island Records on November 17, 2017. On March 2, 2018, an English remix of the song titled ""Not on You"" was released.  The song has reached number one in Austria, Lebanon, Slovenia, Mexico and Spain as well as the top ten in Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden and Switzerland, the top twenty in Croatia, France, Greece, Latvia, the Netherlands and Norway, and the top thirty in Scotland. It also reached number 46 in the UK and 47 on the Billboard Hot 100.  Release and promotion [ edit ]  Lovato first teased a photo from the music video shot via Instagram on October 21, 2017,[2] to which Fonsi commented: ""What's up Demi..."", and later posted a behind-the-scenes picture on his own Instagram, captioned: ""Finished! It's a wrap"",[3] to which Lovato replied: ""Hola Fonsi"".[4] On November 1, 2017, MTV News reported that the collaboration will be titled ""Échame la Culpa"", a song Fonsi has been performing solo during live shows across the summer.[5] In an interview with Billboard at iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina in Miami, Fonsi admitted: ""It's a fun song, a fun record, we already filmed the video."" He also revealed that the song would premiere in two weeks.[6] In a clip shared by Billboard on November 13, 2017, Lovato and Fonsi can be seen meeting each other via a FaceTime call to discuss details about their collaboration.[7] On November 14, 2017, Lovato took to social media to announce the song's release, along with a snippet of the song featuring only her part,[8][9][10][11] as Fonsi posted a shot of himself lying in bed with pillows covered in the song's title.[12][13] It was released onto iTunes for download three days later,[14] and Fonsi published a photo that day of a truck with him and Lovato on it, as well as short quotes, including ""¿Qué pasa Demi?"" (English: What's up Demi?) and ""Hey Fonsi"".[15] Fonsi told Viva Latino: ""The lyrics are very joyful. It's that play on words, that famous cliché of 'It's not you, it's me' that many of us have used.""[16] On April 12, 2018, Fonsi performed the song live together with German singer Helene Fischer during a medley with ""Despacito"" at the German Echo Music Prize.[17]  Critical reception [ edit ]  The song received positive reviews from music critics. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song ""a jaunty, celebratory number"", and felt Lovato singing in clipped Spanish is ""only marginally less comfortable than the bumpy-edged English-language semi-soul she employs elsewhere on the song"".[18] Deepa Lakshmin of MTV News wrote that it is ""equally infectious"" as ""Despacito"".[19] Ross McNeilage of the same publication deemed the song ""an absolute powerhouse anthem that goes harder than 'Despacito' ever did"", and gave credit to ""Demi's flawless Spanish and [Fonsi and Lovato's] undeniable chemistry"".[20] Bianca Gracie of Fuse regarded it as ""a welcomed refresher away from the ongoing 'Despacito' takeover"".[21]  Music video [ edit ]  The music video first takes place in Lovato's bedroom, before the duo meet up in an abandoned warehouse and hold a dance party.[22][23][24] In its first 24 hours of release, the video accrued more than 17 million views, a record for Lovato.[25]  On YouTube, the video became the third-fastest music video in history to 500 million and the fifth-fastest to reach 1 billion views, being the fastest collaboration in history to reach these two milestones.[26] As of December 2018, it has received over 1.7 billion views, making it the site's 36th most-viewed video.[27]  Live performances [ edit ]  Fonsi and Lovato made their duet debut performance during Lovato's Tell Me You Love Me World Tour at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, United States on March 30, 2018.[28] On April 12, 2018, Fonsi performed the song live together with German singer Helene Fischer during a medley with ""Despacito"" at the German Echo Music Prize.[29] On May 27, 2018, Fonsi performed the song with Lovato during the BBC Music's Biggest Weekend.[30] The song is included in both Luis Fonsi's Love + Dance World Tour and Lovato's Tell Me You Love Me World Tour set list.

Born in Georgia in 1942, Wilson made his onscreen debut in 1967’s In the Heat of the Night and followed it up later that year with the role of real-life murderer Dick Hickock in an adaptation of Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. He played George Wilson opposite Robert Redford in 1974’s The Great Gatsby and earned a Golden Globe nomination in 1980 for his turn in The Ninth Configuration.  Wilson also made memorable recurring appearances on CSI as Sam Braun, the father of Marg Helgenberger’s Catherine Willows, and followed his time on The Walking Dead with roles on Bosch and The OA.

"Scott Disick‘s girlfriend Sofia Richie celebrated her 20th birthday in a bikini — and his ex Kourtney Kardashian apparently refused to be outdone, following up with a topless shot.  “I’m like goddamn bitch, I am not a teen choice #20,” Richie captioned her sultry snap.  Hours later on Friday, Kardashian, 39, took to her Instagram story from a swanky walk-in closet wearing jeans, heels and nothing on top but a necklace — plus her arm and a text bar reading “proud wife” obscuring her nipples. She captioned the image, “I swear this is about [pal] Steph [Shepherd’s] jeans.”  Richie has been dating Disick, 35, for about a year.  Kardashian, who shares sons Mason and Reign and daughter Penelope with Disick, split from a much younger lover of her own, 25-year-old model Younes Bendjima, earlier this month.  Disick and Kardashian discussed their rocky on-again-off-again romance on the 10-year-anniversary special of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” in September 2017.  “The debauchery that’s gone on has definitely closed the door several billion times [on a reconciliation], but it’s been back open,” Kardashian said at the time.  Disick quipped, “Here’s the thing, every time I become too good of a person, she stops loving me because she fell in love with a guy who was a little bit f–ked up … I treat you like royalty, you don’t say hello to me. I spit in your face, you’re like, ‘Hey babe.’ ”  Kardashian and Disick split, seemingly for good, in July 2015.",0
"LONDON -- The father of the former Meghan Markle says he talked politics with Prince Harry over the phone -- and Harry said he should give President Donald Trump a chance. Thomas Markle told broadcaster ITV on Monday that he had several phone conversations with Harry, including one in which the prince asked for permission to marry his daughter.  Markle said Mr. Trump was discussed at least once: ""Our conversation was I was complaining about not liking Donald Trump, he said 'give Donald Trump a chance'. I sort of disagreed with that.""  Markle said he also asked his future son-in-law about Britain's 2016 decision to leave the European Union and got the impression Harry is comfortable with Brexit.  ""I think he was open to the experiment,"" Markle said.  Harry's press office declined to comment on Markle's televised interview, which could raise eyebrows because senior royal figures are scrupulously careful not to comment publicly on domestic or international political affairs.  Markle, who had been scheduled to walk his daughter down the aisle, missed the royal wedding in May due to heart problems. He told ITV he was ""doing much better"" and that he regretted missing the big event.  The 73-year-old Markle, who watched the wedding from California, says he was ""very proud"" but that ""the unfortunate thing for me now is I'm a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle.""  ""I can't think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles,"" he says of Prince Harry's own father, who walked Meghan most of the way down the aisle on her wedding day. ""He looked very handsome and my daughter looked beautiful with him. I was jealous, I wish I had been there, I wish it'd been me. But thank God he was there and thank him for that.""  He says the couple, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will probably seek to have children soon.  ""She's wanted children for a long time,"" he said.  Markle said he gave Harry permission to marry his daughter over the phone.  ""Harry asked for her hand on the phone and I said: 'You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission. ""'",0

Kelley February 19, 2017 ( ) 1.13[3] At a public school in Monterey, a murder suddenly occurs on trivia night, but neither the victim nor the murderer is revealed. Backtracking to the first day of school, the families of five first-graders are introduced. Madeline Martha Mackenzie is a strong-willed, wealthy, and feared alpha female in town with a first-grade daughter and teenage daughter from an earlier marriage. Her friend, retired lawyer Celeste Wright, is the mother of twin sons who are also beginning at that same school. New to town is Jane Chapman – a young single mother raising her son, Ziggy. Renata Klein's daughter Amabella accuses Ziggy of attempting to choke her, which he denies. Madeline and Celeste befriend Jane. Secrets are revealed, including that Madeline is struggling to cope with her ex-husband Nathan's marriage to a yoga instructor named Bonnie and also trying to build a relationship with her older daughter. Celeste appears to have a very happy life with her husband Perry, but he starts to show signs of being violent. Jane's motives for moving to Monterey are unknown. 2 ""Serious Mothering"" Jean-Marc Vallée David E. Kelley February 26, 2017 ( ) 0.56[4] Perry lashes out at Celeste when he discovers he missed orientation at the school, but Celeste lets it slide. Jane looks for work with little success. Madeline goes on the warpath with Renata when it is revealed Renata did not invite Ziggy to Amabella's birthday party. Ed questions Madeline's devotion to him when she continues to complain about seeing Nathan with Bonnie all the time. Madeline is further disturbed when Bonnie takes her oldest daughter, Abby, to Planned Parenthood. Nathan tries to come to a peaceful resolution with Ed about their parenting of Abby, but Ed senses Nathan trying to intimidate him and stands firm. Madeline's younger daughter, Chloe, and Bonnie's daughter, Skye, attempt to mend the wounds between Ziggy and Amabella but it leads to an incident of unwanted affection and the parents of the four children are called into the principal's office, leading Jane to have a flashback of an unwanted episode. 3 ""Living the Dream"" Jean-Marc Vallée David E. Kelley March 5, 2017 ( ) 1.04[5] Perry chokes Celeste when he believes she deliberately left him out of a family gathering, after which Celeste threatens to leave him. Renata's party for Amabella is a huge success but she is ultimately upset when Madeline invited Amabella's closest friends and Ziggy to Disney on Ice on the same day. At therapy, Perry claims his outbursts are out of fear that Celeste does not love him, which Celeste attempts to deny. When Abby's academic performance begins to decline her guidance counselor suggests it is being caused by stress at home so Abby decides to live with Nathan, much to Madeline's dismay. Jane gets Ziggy involved with more extracurricular activities and helps him construct a family tree for school with Madeline's help. Jane lashes out at Ziggy when he insists on putting his father's name on the tree, and Jane confides to Madeline that Ziggy was the result of rape by a man named Saxon Banks, whom she has not seen since. 4 ""Push Comes to Shove"" Jean-Marc Vallée David E. Kelley March 12, 2017 ( ) 1.04[6] Abigail moves in with Nathan and Bonnie. Celeste legally represents Joseph and Madeline in a meeting with the Mayor regarding the controversial Avenue Q, and successfully convinces the Mayor to allow the play to proceed. In the process, she realizes her desire to return to work. She asks her therapist how to best convince Perry but Dr. Reisman is more concerned with why Celeste is afraid to do so. At home, Perry tells Celeste not to attend any future meetings. When she refuses, he grabs her by the throat but quickly relinquishes when one of their boys enters the room. Joseph and Madeline kiss and it is revealed they had an affair a year ago. Madeline locates a man online named Saxon Baker whom she believes to be Saxon Banks. She informs Jane and Celeste, and they plan to travel to San Luis Obispo to confront him. Ms. Barnes, the teacher, suspects Amabella is still being bullied. Despite Amabella's assertions that she and Ziggy are friends, Ms. Barnes requests Jane to have Ziggy psychologically evaluated. The psychologist believes that Ziggy is innocent and that he may actually be being bullied himself. 5 ""Once Bitten"" Jean-Marc Vallée David E.

Kelley and directed by Andrea Arnold.[46] Vallée will remain an executive producer of the series.[47] Meryl Streep will join the cast as the mother of Alexander Skarsgård's character.[48]  The announcement of the second season, and—specifically—its timing, enraged the producers of rival shows that are competing for award nomination in the limited series category.[49] Immediately following HBO's decision to produce a second installment of Big Little Lies, the Producers Guild of America moved to reclassify the original installment of the show from a limited series to a drama series for the upcoming 2018 PGA Awards.[50]  Reception [ edit ]  Critical response [ edit ]  Big Little Lies was met with a positive response from critics.

"Lisa Page, former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship.According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘assets’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000+ “missing” emails, federal sources said.The Russians didn’t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?",1

"Oh no — a new report claims Khloe Kardashian had major pregnancy issues that prematurely landed her in the hospital! Find out here what reportedly went wrong.  At nearly nine months pregnant, Khloe Kardashian, 33, recently experienced a health scare that “left her rattled,” according to OK! magazine. While everything is ok now, and Khloe is no longer at Cedars-Sinai in LA, she’s reportedly SO shaken up that she’s reconsidering giving birth in Cleveland! “Word is, she suffered some pregnancy complications and had to be rushed to Cedars-Sinai in Los Angles,” an insider told the publication. “Everyone was worried she’d need an emergency C-section.” Click here to see pics of Khloe’s lavish baby shower.  The source didn’t expand on what type of complications Khloe was having, but, apparently Khloe thinks it COULD have to do with her recent trip to Japan with her sisters. Although she was already eight months along, the reality star decided to fly overseas, insisting her doctor approved the entire thing. “I wouldn’t put my baby at risk,” she said at the time. Now, however, she may have had a change of heart. “Khloe took all the necessary precautions with her trip, but now of course she’s wondering if it contributed to an unnecessary scare,” the insider shared.  Luckily, Khole’s family was by her side during her health incident, but if she follows through with her plan to give birth in Cleveland, so baby daddy Tristan Thompson, 27, can be there, she won’t have that same level of familial support. “She’s anxious about flying again and being so far from her family. This experience made her realize she needs her support system nearby,” the source explained, adding that her current Cleveland birthing plan is “up in the air.”  But while her family was there to help her through this alleged recent scare, Tristan, was working back in Ohio. “He was on the road with his team and she was so emotional about him not being there,” the source said. “It got really heated…Things have calmed down since the spat, but they’re both so busy with work. It’s been stressful.”  This past weekend, on March 10, Tristan WAS there to celebrate his and Khloe’s impending arrival. The two had a gorgeous baby shower for their baby girl, and of course everything was covered in pink. While this has been a magical time for KoKo, she’s also beyond ready to meet her daughter! “She can’t wait to just hold her baby girl in her arms and know that she’s safe,” OK’s insider said.",1

(Laughter.)And I know this isn’t your typical school -- second day of school. So I want to give a special shout-out to the new seniors, class of 2014. (Applause.) You are aware that you’re not finished yet. (Laughter.) Senior year, that’s sometimes tempting. I want you all to stay focused.Over the past couple weeks, I have been --AUDIENCE MEMBER: Happy birthday, Mr. President!THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) It was my birthday two days ago. (Laughter.) Got some singers here.AUDIENCE: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, Mr. President. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) I am now 52, and Michelle says that I don’t look a day over 51. (Laughter.)So over the last few weeks, I’ve been visiting towns all across the country, talking about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class -- a national strategy to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed in the 21st century economy.And I think people in Arizona especially understand the challenges that are out there, because for the past four and a half years, together, we fought our way back from a devastating recession that cost millions of jobs for Americans. A lot of folks lost their homes; a lot of folks lost their savings. And what the recession showed was the long erosion of middle-class security that had been taking place for decades.But we fought back. We took on a broken health care system. We took on a housing market that was in free fall. We invested in new technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We changed a tax code that had become tilted a little bit too much in favor of the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working families. (Applause.) We saved the auto industry. We’ve now got GM that plans to hire a thousand new workers right next door in Chandler to make sure we’re building some of the best cars in the world right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)Our businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the past 41 months. We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Our exports are way up. We produce more renewable energy than ever before, more natural gas than anybody else. Health care costs have been growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are coming down at the fastest rate in 60 years. So we’re making progress. (Applause.)So thanks to the efforts of a lot of people like you, we’ve cleared away the rubble of the financial crisis. We’re starting to lay the foundation for more stable, more durable economic growth. But as any middle-class family will tell you, we’re not yet where we need to be. Because even before the crisis hit, we had lived through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, but most families were working harder and harder just to get by.And reversing this trend should be -- must be -- Washington’s highest priority. It’s my highest priority. (Applause.) I want to make sure that in America, it doesn’t matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love -- you should be able to make it when you try. You should be able to make it. (Applause.)Now, unfortunately, for the last year or so, we’ve had an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals that shift focus away from what do we need to do to shore up middle-class families and create ladders of opportunity for folks to get into the middle class. And as Washington heads towards another budget debate, the stakes could not be higher.And that’s why I’m traveling around, laying out my ideas for how we have to build the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class: a good job with good wages; a home to call your own; a good education; affordable health care that’s there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you’re not rich; the opportunity -- the ladders of opportunity for people to earn their way into the middle class, to work their way out of poverty. Those are the elements that I think all of us believe in, but right now we're not delivering as much as we should on those promises.Now, last Tuesday, I went to Tennessee to talk about the first cornerstone, which is how do we make sure that we're creating good middle-class jobs here in the United States of America. Today I've come to Phoenix to talk about the second component, which is the most tangible cornerstone that lies at the heart of the American Dream, at the heart of middle-class life -- and that's the chance to own your own home. (Applause.) The chance to own your own home.We've got a lot of young people here who are thinking about college, they're going to get a higher education, they're going to find a job, they're going to find somebody they love, they're going to want to own a home. And the reason they will is because a home is the ultimate evidence that here in America, hard work pays off, that responsibility is rewarded.I think about my grandparents’ generation. When my grandfather served in World War II, he fought in Patton's Army -- when he got back, this country gave him a chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill, but it also gave him the chance to buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. To him, and to generations of Americans before and since, a home was more than just a house. It was a source of pride and a source of security. It was a place to raise kids, to put down roots; a place where you could build up savings for college, or to start a business, or to retire with some security.And buying a home required responsibility on everybody’s part. You had to save up to buy a home. And then banks were supposed to give you a fair deal, with terms you could understand, and buyers were supposed to live within their means and make sure that they could make their payments. So in that earlier generation, houses weren’t for flipping around, they weren’t for speculation -- houses were to live in, and to build a life with.And unfortunately, over time, responsibility too often gave way to recklessness. You had reckless lenders who sold loans to people they knew couldn’t afford them. And let's face it, we also had some reckless buyers who knew they couldn’t afford them and still took out loans. And all this created a housing bubble. And especially in some places like Arizona, it was devastating when that bubble finally burst -- triggered a recession. Millions of Americans who had done everything right were hurt badly by the actions of other people. Housing prices plummeted.By the time I took office, home values had fallen almost 20 percent from the year before. New housing starts had fallen nearly 80 percent from their peak. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers had lost their jobs. A record number of people were behind on their mortgage payments. And a lot of people here in Phoenix, they saw that devastation. This was part of Ground Zero for the housing bubble bursting.So less than a month after I took office, I came here to Arizona and I laid out steps to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners get back on their feet. And the truth is it's been a long, slow process. The housing market is so big that it was going to take some time to heal when it got hurt that badly. It's taken longer than any of us would like. But during that time, we helped millions of Americans save an average of $3,000 each year by refinancing at lower rates. We helped millions of responsible homeowners stay in their homes, which was good for their neighbors because you don't want a bunch of foreclosure signs in your neighborhood.Where Congress wouldn’t act, we went ahead and acted, so over the past few years, we had the Department of Justice stand up for buyers who had been discriminated against or conned by predatory lending. And we won a settlement that gave more money to victims of discrimination in one year than in the previous 23 years combined. (Applause.)We worked with states to force big banks to repay more than $50 billion to more than 1.5 million families -- largest lending settlement in history. (Applause.) We extended the time that folks who had lost their jobs could delay their payment on their mortgages while they kept looking for work. We cracked down on the bad practices that led to the crisis in the first place. I mean, you had some loans back there in the bubble that were called “liar’s loan.” Now, something that's called a liar's loan is probably a bad idea. (Laughter.)So because of all these actions we've been taking, our housing market is beginning to heal. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in seven years. Sales are up nearly 50 percent. Construction is up nearly 75 percent. New foreclosures are down by nearly two-thirds. Millions of families have been able to come up for air -- they’re no longer underwater on their mortgages. (Applause.)And just like the crisis hit Phoenix very hard, thanks to some great leadership here locally, Phoenix has also led one of the biggest comebacks in the country. (Applause.) So you should be proud of what you've done here. Home prices in Phoenix have risen by nearly 20 percent over the last year. New home sales are up by more than 25 percent.This morning, right before I came here, I visited Erickson Construction -- (applause.) We've got some Erickson folks here. And they were explaining how right when the bubble hit, Erickson shrank to less than a hundred workers. Today they're employing 580 people -- and they’re hiring even more people -- (applause) -- because the housing market is bouncing back.So that's one of the things about housing. It's not just important for the person who owns the house; our economy is so impacted by everything that happens in housing. Consumers feel better when their home values are in a better place, so they're more willing to spend. A lot of people who want to start a business, their savings may be locked up in their house. Construction workers, contractors, suppliers, carpet makers, all these folks are impacted by the housing industry.So we've made progress, and that's helped to move the economy forward. But we've got to build on this progress. We're not where we need to be yet. We've got to give more hardworking Americans the chance to buy their first home. (Applause.) We have to help more responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, because a lot of them still have a spread between the rates they're paying right now on their mortgage and what they could be getting if they were able to refinance.And we’ve got to turn the page on this kind of bubble-and-bust mentality that helped to create this mess in the first place. (Applause.) We got to build a housing system that is durable and fair and rewards responsibility for generations to come. That's what we’ve got to do. (Applause.)So I’ve already put forward a bunch of ideas that will help accomplish that. And, look, the fact of the matter is Congress hasn’t enacted all of them, so I’d like you to encourage members of Congress to take some of these actions. (Applause.)But like the other actions that we’ve taken, these will not help the neighbors down the street who bought a house that they couldn’t afford, and then walked away from it and left a foreclosed home behind. We don't want to help speculators who bought multiple homes just to make a quick buck.What we want to do is put forward ideas that will help millions of responsible, middle-class homeowners who still need relief. And we want to help hardworking Americans who dream of owning their own home fair and square, have a down payment, are willing to make those payments, understand that owning a home requires responsibility. And there are some immediate actions we could take right now that would help on that front, that would make a difference. So let me just list a couple of them.Number one: Congress should pass a good, bipartisan idea to allow every homeowner the chance to save thousands of dollars a year by refinancing their mortgage at today’s rates. (Applause.) We need to get that done. We’ve been talking about it for a year and a half, two years, three years. There’s no reason not to do it. (Applause.)Step number two: Now that we’ve made it harder for reckless buyers to buy homes that they can’t afford, let’s make it a little bit easier for qualified buyers to buy the homes that they can afford. (Applause.) So Shaun Donovan has been working with the finance industry to make sure we’re simplifying overlapping regulations; we’re cutting red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but keep getting rejected by the banks. We need to give well-qualified Americans who lost their jobs during the crisis a fair chance to get a loan if they’ve worked hard to repair their credit.And step three is something that you don’t always hear about when it comes to the housing market, and that is fixing our broken immigration system. It would actually help our housing market. (Applause.)It’s pretty simple: When more people buy homes and play by the rules, home values go up for everybody. And according to one recent study, the average homeowner has already seen the value of their home boosted by thousands of dollars just because of immigration. And the good news is, with the help of your Senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, the Senate has already passed a bipartisan immigration bill. It’s got the support of CEOs and labor and law enforcement. (Applause.) This could help homeownership here.So I want you to encourage Republicans in the House of Representatives to stop dragging their feet. Let’s go ahead and get this done.Step number four: We should address the uneven recovery by rebuilding the communities hit the hardest by the housing crisis, including many right here in Arizona. Let’s put construction back -- construction workers back to work repairing rundown homes, tearing down vacant properties so that the value of homes in those surrounding areas start picking up. We can put people to work right now and improve the remaining housing stock that's out there. (Applause.) Places that are facing a longer road back from the crisis should have their country’s help to get back on their feet.Step five: We should make sure families that don’t want to buy a home or can’t yet afford to buy one still have a decent place to rent. (Applause.) It’s important for us to encourage homeownership, but a lot of people rent and there’s nothing wrong with renting. And we got to make sure that we are creating affordable opportunities when it comes to rental properties.In the run-up to the crisis, banks and governments too often made everybody feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren’t ready and didn't have the payments. That’s a mistake we should not repeat. Instead, let’s invest in affordable rental housing. Let’s bring together cities and states to address local barriers that drive up rents for working families. (Applause.)So if we help more Americans refinance their homes, if we help qualified families get a mortgage, we reform our immigration system, we rebuild the hardest-hit communities, we make sure that folks have a decent place to rent if they're not yet able to buy -- all these steps will give more middle-class families the chance to either buy their own home now or eventually buy their own home. It's going to give more relief to responsible homeowners. It gives more options to families who aren’t yet ready to buy. All that is going to improve the housing market and will improve the economy.But -- and this is the last key point I want to make -- as home prices rise, we can’t just re-inflate another housing bubble. I hope everybody here in Arizona learned some hard lessons from what happened. Housing prices generally don't just keep on going up forever at the kind of pace it was going up. It was crazy. So what we want to do is something stable and steady. And that's why I want to lay a rock-solid foundation to make sure the kind of crisis we went through never happens again. We've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. (Applause.)And one of the key things to make sure it doesn't happen again is to wind down these companies that are not really government, but not really private sector -- they're known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For too long, these companies were allowed to make huge profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag. It was “heads we win, tails you lose.” And it was wrong. And along with what happened on Wall Street, it helped to inflate this bubble in a way that ultimately killed Main Street.So the good news is, right now there’s a bipartisan group of senators working to end Fannie and Freddie as we know them. And I support these kinds of reform efforts. And they're following four core principles for what I believe this reform should look like.First, private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist -- I think I saw some posters there on the way in. (Laughter.) But I actually believe in the free market. And just like the health care law that we put in place, Obamacare -- (applause) -- which, by the way, if you don't have health insurance or you're buying it at exorbitant rates on the individual market, starting on October 1st, you can join a marketplace and be part of a pool that gives you much lower premiums, saves you a lot of money. (Applause.)But in the same way that what we did with health care was to set up clear rules for insurance companies to protect consumers, make it more affordable, but still built on the private marketplace, I believe that our housing system should operate where there's a limited government role and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market. And that includes, by the way, community-based lenders who view their borrowers not as a number, but as a neighbor. So that's one principle.A second principle is we can't leave taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions by some of these lenders or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. (Applause.) We've got to encourage the pursuit of profit, but the era of expecting a bailout after you pursue your profit and you don't manage your risk well -- well, that puts the whole country at risk. And we're ending those days. We're not going to do that anymore. (Applause.)The third principle is we should preserve access to safe and simple mortgage products like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. That’s something families should be able to rely on when they're making the most important purchase of their lives. (Applause.)Number four, we've got to keep housing affordable for first-time homebuyers -- like all these young people. When they're ready to buy a house, we've got to make sure it's affordable. Families who are working to climb their way into the middle class, we've got to do what we can to make housing affordable. And that means we've got to strengthen the FHA so it gives today’s families the same kind of chance it gave my grandparents to buy a home, and it preserves those rungs on the ladder of opportunity.And we've got to support, as I said, affordable rental housing. And, by the way, we've also got to keep up our fight against homelessness. (Applause.) The Mayor of Phoenix has been doing a great job here in Phoenix on that front. We've got to continue to improve it. (Applause.)Since I took office, we helped bring one in four homeless veterans off the streets. (Applause.) We should be proud of that. Here in Phoenix, thanks to the hard work of everyone from Mayor Stanton to the local United Way to US Airways, you’re on track to end chronic homelessness for veterans, period, by 2014. (Applause.)But we've got to keep going, because nobody in America, and certainly no veteran, should be left to live on the streets. (Applause.)So here's the bottom line: Put all these principles together, that's going to protect our entire economy and it will improve the housing market not just here in Phoenix, but throughout the state and throughout the country.We're also going to need to make sure, though, that we're protecting individual homeowners. We've got to give them the tools that they can protect themselves. So we've got a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that we created. (Applause.) And it's laying down new rules of the road that everybody can count on when they’re shopping for a mortgage. They’re designing a new, simple mortgage form that will be in plain English, so you can actually read it without a lawyer -- (applause) -- although, you may still want a lawyer obviously. I'm not saying you don't. I'm just saying you'll be able to read it. (Laughter.) There won't be a lot of fine print. That way you know before you owe. (Laughter and applause.)And the Senate finally confirmed Richard Cordray as the head of this -- head watchdog for the CFPB. (Applause.) So he's out there aggressively protecting consumers and homeowners.When it comes to some of the other leaders we need to look out for the American people, the Senate still has a job to do. Months ago, I nominated a man named Mel Watt to be our nation’s top housing regulator. He is an outstanding member of Congress. And during that time, he was on the Housing Committee -- worked with banks, worked with borrowers to protect consumers, to help responsible lenders provide credit. He is the right person for the job. Congress and the Senate should give his nomination an up or down vote without any more obstruction or delay. We don't have time for those kinds of games. (Applause.)So I want to be honest with you. No program or policy is going to solve all the problems in a multi-trillion dollar housing market. The housing bubble went up so high, the heights it reached before it burst were so unsustainable, that we knew it was going to take some time for us to fully recover. But if we take the steps that I talked about today, then I know we will restore not just our home values, but also our common values. We’ll make owning a home a symbol of responsibility, not speculation -- a source of security for generations to come, just like it was for my grandparents. I want it to be just like that for all the young people who are here today and their children and their grandchildren. (Applause.)And if we stay focused on middle-class security and opportunities to get into the middle class, if we take the strategy that I'm laying out for the entire economy -- for jobs and housing and education, health care, retirement, creating ladders of opportunity -- then we will secure that better bargain for all Americans, where hard work is once again rewarded with a shot at a middle-class life, which means more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will know the satisfaction of flipping the sign to “Open” on their own business. More Americans will know the joy of scratching the child’s height on the door of their new home -- with pencil, of course. (Laughter.)We can do all this if we work together. And it won’t be easy. But if we take just a few bold steps -- and if Washington will just end the gridlock, set aside the slash-and-burn partisanship -- (applause) -- actually try to solve problems instead of scoring political points, our economy will grow stronger a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now. (Applause.)And as long as I've got the privilege to serve as your President, that's what I'm going to be fighting for.Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. (Applause.)END 1:35 P.M. MST",0
"Florida Democrats Ask HHS to Protect Floridians from High Insurance Premiums in Marketplace f t # e Washington, DC, August 1, 2013 | (202-225-3001) In a letter sent today to U.S. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius led by Congressman Ted Deutch (FL-21), the Florida Democratic delegation in the House of Representatives slammed Governor Rick Scott and the Florida legislature for stripping the state of the authority to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums and called on the Department of Health and Human Services to take a more active role in reviewing rates in Florida. The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years.In the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are “not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high…. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers – since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.”Joining Rep. Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below.August 1, 2013The Honorable Kathleen SebeliusSecretaryU.S. Department of Health and Human Services200 Independence Ave., SWWashington, DC 20201RE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium RatesDear Secretary Sebelius,It has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State.As you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now.As of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates.Unfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Florida’s Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMS’s determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers.Indeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower.Over 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Florida’s new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable.While other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in.The Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers – since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. f t # eRelated News Deutch, FL Dems ask Gov.

"CLOSE Among her many unforgettable qualities, Diana was known for her fabulous style. From ditching her gloves to speaking to the people through her clothing, Diana's flawless style lives on. USA TODAY  Princess Diana and her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II in London, August 4, 1987. (Photo: Associated Press)  Princess Diana mystified and irked the British royals in life, but in death she changed them in ways that strengthened the monarchy by making them seem a bit more like her — warm, approachable, human.  Exhibit A has to be the 2012 London Olympics when Queen Elizabeth II, then 86 and celebrating 60 years on her throne, participated in an extraordinary video skit to open the Games, featuring James Bond actor Daniel Craig and ""the queen"" as a Bond girl skydiving from a helicopter into Olympic Stadium. Mouths dropped, especially those of her grandchildren, as tens of thousands of Brits watching cheered and roared.  RELATED: Princess Diana remembered  ""Would she have done that cameo had it not been for Diana, all those years earlier, who emboldened them to do things in a fresh way and be more relatable?"" says American biographer Sally Bedell Smith, who's written best-sellers about both the queen and Diana.  The Princess of Wales' feelings about the Windsors were as mercurial as she was, toggling between awe and admiration to rage and despair during the years she was the desperately unhappy wife of Prince Charles and the daughter-in-law of the queen and Prince Philip.  As the queen herself said at the time, there were ""lessons to be drawn"" from the story of Diana, and these are now apparent, says British PR consultant and royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams.  ""Diana's more approachable, endearing and emotional style, her conviction that the royal family had no heart, the way she appealed to the public in (interviews), all this was unique but had real impact,"" Fitzwilliams says. ""It is a tribute to the resilience of the Windsors that they have made certain changes yet kept the monarchy's mystique.""  Despite her troubles with her in-laws, Diana said she wanted to bolster the ties between the monarchy and the people; she was, after all, the mother of a future king.  ""It's vital the monarchy keeps in touch with the people — it's what I try to do,"" she told former Times editor Peter Stothard at a lunch in 1994, according to Phil Dampier's new collection of Diana quotes, Diana: I'm Going to Be Me.  British royal reporter and broadcaster Katie Nicholl, author of several royal biographies, says Diana broke the royal mold: She did and said things considered ""very un-royal"" that had a positive effect, especially in the way her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, were raised to be aware of life beyond palace walls.  ""As they have said in recent interviews they are the princes and the men they are today largely because of the way Diana raised them and the things that she exposed them to from an early age,"" Nicholl says.  Queen Elizabeth and other members of Britain's royal family bow their heads as Princess Diana's casket moves slowly past the gates of Buckingham Palace in London, Sept. 6, 1997. (Photo: Associated Press/BBC TV)  ""There is a rawness in these interviews, an openness that Diana would have approved,"" says Fitzwilliams. ""The princes are following directly in her footsteps.""  Diana campaigned for ""politically sensitive"" causes not previously connected to the royals, including AIDS, homelessness and landmines — issues that touched real people and people who had no voice, Nicholl says.  ""Ultimately, this was all very positive for the royal family even though the queen and others were concerned at points that some of the issues Diana was campaigning for weren’t synonymous with what royals should be doing,"" Nicholl says. ""To the people, Diana was seen as in touch. She was a princess, but one who wasn’t afraid to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in and that did the royal family a huge amount of good.""  No doubt the 1,000-year-old British monarchy already knew a thing or two about keeping in touch with the people (to do otherwise risked execution and exile over the centuries), but it was Diana — equal parts beguiling and bewildering — whose shocking death helped remind them of this fundamental survival skill.  After she was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997, an almost-as-shocking tsunami of grief washed over Britain and the world, and nearly swamped the royals.  Tucked away at their usual summer bastion of Balmoral, their vast estate in Scotland, they were unprepared for the unprecedented reaction back in London: The hysteria, the headlines, the 24/7 media coverage. Also, the persistent importuning, from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and many others, that the queen return, respond to the public grief, and put on a semi-royal funeral for Diana.  ""The queen has an unchanging style which has been perfection; the death of Diana was the one occasion where reliance on tradition and precedent were not appropriate and Blair was fortunately there to advise her,"" Fitzwilliams says.  The queen met all the demands and more, after first balking. She rose to the occasion with a stirring live speech to the nation (a rarity) before the funeral in which she paid tribute to Diana.  Queen Elizabeth II speaks from Buckingham Palace to pay tribute to Princess Diana, on Sept. 5, 1997. (Photo: AP)  In deed and metaphor, the queen bowed her head to Diana's coffin, and it was sincere. Diana was no longer a member of the royal family, and she had behaved in obnoxious ways in the years before her 1996 divorce, but she was still the mother of the queen's young grandsons; this was a gesture no loving grandmother would withhold.  ""Diana had a real effect on the monarchy,"" Smith says. ""They realized, in their practical and efficient way, that Diana had touched people in a special way, in accessibility and informality. They commissioned research, polling, focus groups, and they responded, not in a dramatic way, but in an incremental way. The queen did things a little more informally, she loosened protocol.""  Immediately, public opinion about the queen and her family swung back to its previous high levels. In the years since Diana's death, the royals have been more popular than ever, culminating in extravagant displays of affection for the queen during her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and for her 90th birthday in 2016.  Even Prince Charles and his second wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the longtime mistress Diana blamed for her marital woes, are popular (if only because they are not as widely despised as they were in 1997).  Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry inspect floral tributes to Princess Diana outside Kensington Palace, Sept. 5, 1997. (Photo: DAVID BRAUCHLI, Associated Press)  Victoria Arbiter, daughter of the queen's former press secretary and a royal commentator for CNN in New York, says ""little glimpses of Diana"" are everywhere apparent today. But she also gives credit to the queen.  ""You can't take anything away from the queen and her ability to adapt and evolve and meet the needs of the people at any one time,"" Arbiter says. ""Diana should be credited with many changes, one of which is the royal family is very much more hands on. They're getting much more involved on a visceral level as a result of Diana.""  Society's expectations have changed, Arbiter says. The deference and formality associated with the royals are disappearing. You might not see the queen sipping tea in a Starbucks, but she's no longer quite as remote as she once was.  ""It's been slow, gradual change,"" Arbiter says, ""and Diana was definitely the trigger.""      .  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2xNwLFP",0

He had auditioned for Jughead,” she told Cosmopolitian in 2017. “I think we just randomly had mutual friends, so we added each other.”  “We kept in touch very rarely, not even that much, from January to February, and then the day I got back from season one in February I was bored in L.A., believe it or not,” she continued. “I was like, ‘What am I gonna do?’ I got my hair cut and he texted me like, ‘Let’s go to a movie!’ We hung out and spent every single day together that I’ve been in L.A. since then, since February.”",0
"Arie and Lauren, the happy couple. (Paul Hebert/ABC)  It has not been a great week for Arie Luyendyk Jr. The 36-year-old race-car-driver-turned-real-estate-agent faced immense backlash after his turn as ABC’s “The Bachelor” when he proposed to Becca Kufrin, a 27-year-old publicist from Minnesota, and then blindsided her with a breakup so he could propose to the runner-up, Lauren Burnham, a 25-year-old salesperson from Virginia.  So, as is tradition, the final “Bachelor” couple has to embark on ABC talk show appearances after the finale — and for Arie, it has naturally turned pretty defensive. By Thursday, even Becca — just named the newest Bachelorette — was halfheartedly defending him during an interview with “Good Morning America.”  “He had to do what he had to do. And I don’t fault him for that,” Becca said, in response to whether she felt “ambushed” by the breakup. “I would want him to follow his heart and not to feel trapped in a relationship with me. At the end of the day, if it had to happen, then it had to happen.”  Here are three takeaways from Arie’s press tour:  [A legislator has a bill to ban ‘The Bachelor’s’ Arie Luyendyk Jr. from Minnesota]  Arie has multiple explanations for breaking up with Becca on camera.  Viewers were stunned on Monday night upon seeing the footage of Becca, who thought she was arriving at a house in Los Angeles to spend a romantic weekend with Arie. Instead, he had brought along a camera crew to film as he called off their engagement because he was still in love with Lauren.  Arie was roasted on social media for this decision — while the producers probably encouraged it, they swear the cameras were Arie’s choice — and some of our country’s top TV personalities were equally confused.  “There’s a lot of backlash from a lot of people,” Michael Strahan said Wednesday on “Good Morning America,” reading tweets from former “Bachelor” contestants who thought the show went too far. “Why was the decision made to film this? It probably could have been done — I think a lot of people felt — in a more quiet way.”  “I really wanted everyone to know that this was on me, this was my fault. And I felt like filming that would let people know that. That if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup,” Arie explained. “And I wanted her that opportunity — honestly, I wanted her the opportunity to be the potential Bachelorette.”  That reasoning was similar to Arie’s thinking that he shared during the finale, about how he wanted to be fully transparent. But essentially saying he was doing a good thing because he knew it would help Becca be named the Bachelorette? Apparently, he thinks he did her a favor.  On Wednesday’s “Live with Kelly and Ryan,” Kelly Ripa called Arie “shady” and said the choice to air the extended breakup was “excessively cruel.”  “Why break up with Becca like you did on camera and why 40 minutes of us seeing her in so much pain?” Ryan Seacrest asked.  Arie emphasized that although he wanted to film the breakup, he didn’t decide to air the whole thing — that was the producers’ call.  “Through every breakup there’s always questions of what went wrong. And I knew if we did it on camera that I could take ownership of it and that it was completely my fault and my doing. I thought that was important,” Arie said, echoing his earlier answer. “And the whole thing started on camera, and I wanted the story to be told all the way to the end.”  Ah, so he also wanted to do it for continuity’s sake. Good to know.  Arie wants everyone to know he’s fine with the backlash.  Social media users have not been kind. “Are you worried about how people are going to react to your relationship with Lauren?” Michael Strahan asked on “GMA.”  “I think that, you know, you’d love to have the support from people online, but what really matters is our relationship, our family, our friends, and they’re all on board,” Arie said.  Lauren repeated this idea when she joined Arie later in the interview, and Strahan asked again about how they’re handling the haters.  “If either of us is struggling, we come to each other and try to make light of any kind of hate we get. Just kind of joke around,” she said.  “I think we try to turn it around and try to poke fun at things. Some things are kind of funny,” Arie said, noting that he and Lauren “didn’t get the best edit” on the show. “As long as we have each other, we’ll be okay.”  Arie and Lauren have already started planning the wedding.  At least, that’s what they told Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night. Kimmel was shocked when he asked them a question about whether Arie changes his mind a lot when he’s out at dinner, and Lauren responded that they’ve never actually been to dinner before.  “You haven’t been to a restaurant together? Oh, you should definitely get married right away,” Kimmel deadpanned.  Arie and Lauren also cuddled through every interview, with lots of public displays of affection. They told Ripa and Seacrest that they’re headed out of the country on vacation, and when they get back, they’re going to pack up Lauren’s belongings in Virginia and drive to Phoenix, where they’ll live together. In other words, this disastrous situation was worth it, because they’re soul mates.  “I know it’s difficult for a lot of people to swallow, but I’m happy. And it took a long, hard road to get here,” Arie said. “But I’m really solid in my relationship, and we have been together since January and it’s going really well. And I knew this was going to be a tough week for me.”  Read more:  This ‘Bachelor’ expert says watching the show has made her a smarter dater  The worst moments from an awkward ‘Bachelor’ finale that just kept going  ‘The Bachelor’ tries to do damage control after disastrous finale, but only makes things worse",0

"The first thing you’ll notice about the Dark Knight in Batman v. Superman, the second installation of the newly re-launched DC Universe, is that he’s gotten bigger in stature, muscle, and armor. The next? He’s also badder — gruff, aggressive, and the kind of character willing to square up to the Man of Steel. Given this, you might miss the third fact, that Batman — or at least Ben Affleck, the actor playing him — is also, well, middle-aged.  “I knew that a big part of the audience’s expectation around the role would be how I looked physically,” Affleck, now 43, tells Men’s Journal over email. “And that was something I had some control over. If I was going to fail in this role, I wasn’t going to let it be in a way that could have prevented if I had worked harder.” Director Zack Snyder believes that he got the job done, recently voicing his approval of Affleck’s portrayal as the iconic character, in both of his personas: “He’s an amazing Bruce Wayne, let’s just be frank about that. And then when he puts the cowl on, you know he’s got the chin for it.”  Affleck accomplished the proper frame with help from longtime trainer Walter Norton Jr., of the Institute of Performance and Fitness, who he began training with through a mutual friend during his fitness preparation for 2010’s The Town. Based in Boston, Norton makes almost weekly flights between his hometown and wherever Affleck is, whether it’s in Los Angeles or on location. “Getting ready for this role meant working hard, day in and day out with Walter,” says Affleck. “But it was the kind of work where I felt gains in not only my size, but also my mental and physical health.”  There are benefits of having history with a trainer. “Seven years ago the body bounced back a little quicker,” says Norton. “Like any relationship, it’s all about communication and honesty. I can tell him a little something that he doesn’t want to hear and that’s fine. We’re not tiptoeing around issues. So we just addressed it right at the top. We did what we needed to do to take care of him and protect his joints.”  But that does not mean that Affleck had it easy. Every week Norton created a new regime for him with specific goals, targeting each muscle group relentlessly, and with that mentality they found themselves even overachieving their target numbers. In context, Affleck weighed in at 198 pounds for The Town, and for Batman V. Superman, he went all the way to 231 at 7.7 percent body fat, which they ended up “dialing back” to 225. “This time around we did more bodybuilding. We wanted him to be strong but we wanted to add mass. The volume was higher. We lived on a lot of the basics, 80-pound dumbbell curls, heavy-loaded carries, and farmers walks with 60-pound weights.”  Affleck needed that extra strength on set: The batsuit weighs some 75 pounds. There are also plenty of workout scenes making their way into the final cut, showing off his ripped physique, like one he shot in the Batcave doing pull-ups, while strapped to an additional 50 pounds in weight. “If I had to say there were any critical exercises that we always went back to, it was pull-ups and chin-ups.”  “We wanted him to look like a thick MMA heavyweight puncher,” explains Norton. “This is a Bruce Wayne who’s been lifting for 20 years, hitting that heavyweight bag, and working out every day in the manor. I’ll just say that if you lined up all the Batmans before Ben and stood them next to each other, they’re not 6’4”, and they don’t weigh 225 pounds. He’s in a whole other class.”  Here’s a two-day glimpse at the workouts Norton created for Affleck as part of their two-year training program. You might not want to try this one on your own, though. “I recommend that people find a trainer who they get along with, create their own program suiting their own goals, and if they approach it with the same enthusiasm that Ben did, they can also make gains like a hero.”  Day 1:  Block 1 (32 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Elliptical (Strength Program): 15 minutes  Rumble Roller (Hip/TFL/VMO/2 Way Glute/Calf): 9 minutes  Plank with Arm Extension: 10 seconds (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Spiderman: From a plank, bring you right foot next to your right hand. 3 reps for each side (hold for 2 breaths)  Inchworm: From touching your toes with straight legs, walk your hands out to a plank, then walk your feet back under you, 5 reps (hold for 1 breath)  Calf Stretch: 15 seconds (each leg)  Block 2 (40 minutes): Torso & Strength  Dumbbell Farmer’s Walk: 4 walks with appropriate weight for 1 minute  Alternating Hanging Knee-Up: 11 reps (for each leg)  ½ Kneeling Row: Kneel on your right knee in front of a cable machine, row with your right arm, 4 sets of 12 reps on each side  Back Bridge: 2 reps of 15 second hold (5-second pause between)  Alternating Dumbbell Reverse Lunge: 8 reps (for each leg)  Pull-Up: 6 sets of 4 reps (hold for 4 seconds up and 4 seconds down)  Shoulder Bridge: 10-second hold (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)  Block 3 (22 minutes / Doing As Many Sets As Possible): Strength & Fitness  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 20 seconds  V-Grip Pulldown: 15 reps  Seated Row Handle Grip: 12 reps  Alternating Dumbbell Open Curl: 5 sets of 5 reps (each arm, then 5 reps together)  Goblet Squat: 8 reps  Lateral Squat: 6 reps (each side)  Day 2:  Block 1 (30 minutes): Warm-up & Movement  Airdyne Bike Sprint: 10 reps of 5 minutes at 75% (finish with 15-second sprint, then 45-second rest)    Soft Roller (Upper Back/Lat/Quad/Glute/Ham Junction): 8 minutes  Brettzel Stretch : 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Kneeling Lat: 1 rep each side (hold for 5 breaths)  ½ Kneeling Quad Stretch: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Brettzel: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)  Block 2 (32 minutes): Torso & Strength  Off-Bench Oblique Side Crunch: 8 reps dynamic (followed with hold for 8 seconds)  Valslide Body Slide: 4 sets of 12 reps  Dumbbell Lateral Raise: 4 sets of 12 reps  Back Bridge with March: Hold bridge for 8 seconds (then 4 knee raises on each leg)  Dumbbell Shrug: 5 sets of 6 reps  Rear Delt Machine: 4 sets of 15 reps  1 Leg Hip Lift : 3 sets of 8 reps for each side (hold for 2 seconds)  Tricep Pushdown: 4 sets of 10 heavy reps, then 10 lighter reps  Block 3 (36 minutes): Strength  Dumbbell Deadlift: 4 sets of 6 reps  Dumbbell Bench Press: 4 sets of 10 reps (count 3 seconds from up to down position)  Pec Fly: 4 sets of 12 reps  Ball Leg Curl: 4 sets of 6 reps (hold for 2 seconds)  Batman v Superman is in theaters March 25, 2016.  https://youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro%3Frel%3D0%26controls%3D0%26showinfo%3D0",0
"The 75th Golden Globe Awards officially kick awards season, but this year, the red carpet may create as much conversation as the honors handed out during the ceremony itself.  Last month, reports surfaced that some female actors planned to wear all-black looks on the Golden Globes red carpet to protest sexual misconduct in Hollywood. More recently, some men, including Dwayne Johnson, announced plans to join them. The protest comes after numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against men in Hollywood and other industries, beginning with those against movie producer Harvey Weinstein in October.  Stylist Cristina Ehrlich told TIME Friday that she would be joining the effort by dressing Penelope Cruz, Greta Gerwig and Laura Dern in black.  “The red carpet is watched globally and is therefore an incredible platform for and the perfect place for this sort of demonstration. Where in the past the red carpet has been about glitz and glamour, this year it isn’t about standing out, it’s about standing together and speaking out,” she said.  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  The sartorial choice is being positioned as a way to call attention to the effort to end sexual misconduct. It’s organized by Time’s Up, a new initiative to eradicate sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, which includes the creation of a legal defense fund. Time’s Up, which has also provided pins to be worn on the red carpet, is backed by more than 300 women in the entertainment industry, including Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and Meryl Streep.  This is not the first time stars have used fashion to start a conversation. Take, for example, the blue ACLU ribbons Karlie Kloss and Barry Jenkins, among others, wore to last year’s Oscars, or the Planned Parenthood pin Emma Stone sported while picking up her Best Actress statuette at the same ceremony.  TIME Person of the Year 2017: The Silence Breakers  This year’s red-carpet protest has been subject to some criticism, with some suggesting that sporting a dress in solidarity feels like a superficial or passive way to address a problem. Actor Rose McGowan, one of the first women to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, sounded off on the protest in a now-deleted tweet: “YOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You’ll accept a fake award breathlessly & affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa.” (Marchesa is the high-end brand designed by Weinstein’s wife Georgina Chapman, who announced her separation from the producer shortly after the allegations came to light.)  Activist April Reign, who created the viral #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, suggested that it might send a stronger message if the actors didn’t attend the Golden Globes at all.  In response to the debate, Actor Rashida Jones told InStyle that the choice to wear black dresses on the red carpet is hardly, in her estimation, a “silent protest.” Instead, she said, it’s an opportunity to speak up and demand structural change.  “I don’t think why we wear black is divisive as much as it is being discussed and debated without all the facts,” she said. “Many women on the red carpet will discuss what’s important to them about their choice to protest and wear black. We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time’s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in. It’s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.”  Write to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com.",0
"Jen Harley won’t face domestic charges for an incident in which it was alleged she briefly dragged her ex Ronnie Ortiz-Magro with her car while their infant daughter was in the backseat.  A spokesperson for the Clark County District Attorney’s Office tells PEOPLE that the case was “denied due to insufficient evidence.” TMZ was the first to report the news.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The Jersey Shore star welcomed his first child, daughter Ariana Sky, with Harley on April 3. In the months that followed, the exes have been making headlines for their explosive altercations.  RELATED: Inside Jersey Shore Star Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Jen Harley’s Volatile Relationship  On June 24, Harley, 31, was charged with domestic battery after the car-dragging incident. She was released from the Clark County Detention Center the following day after posting the $3,000 bail.  Jen Harley LVMPD/Splash News  A spokesperson for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told PEOPLE that a suspicious vehicle call came in at about 10:22 p.m. A patrol unit was dispatched to the intersection and determined that a male and a female were in a struggle over a vehicle. Callers reported that the male was bleeding and the car had two flat tires.  Officers made contact with Ortiz-Magro, 32. They also made contact with Harley, who was standing by with another citizen. Officers determined that Ortiz-Magro had gotten out of the vehicle and Harley had driven away as he was holding onto the vehicle, dragging him briefly, according to the spokesperson. She was determined to be primary aggressor and arrested on one count of misdemeanor domestic battery.  Ortiz-Magro had apparent minor injuries to the mouth and arm as well as road rash. He was not transported to the hospital.  According to the spokesperson, “the child was picked up by a family friend before officers arrived on the scene.”  Ortiz-Magro was not filming Jersey Shore Family Vacation when the incident occurred and MTV had no comment when reached by PEOPLE. A rep for Ortiz-Magro also had no comment; Harley was unable to be reached.  Jen Harley and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Jen Harley/Instagram  A source told PEOPLE that Ortiz-Magro and his ex were at a barbecue with friends earlier that day, where they got into a “verbal fight.” On the drive home, “the fight escalated” and Harley “was pummeling his face,” said the source.  “He was screaming for her to stop the car as she was driving,” said the source. “She hit the median and got a flat tire which caused her to slow down. He begged to get out and opened the door but she continued to pull away while he was getting out and it tore up his entire arm. It’s a mess from road rash and from being dragged along the street as he was caught in the belt.”  RELATED: Jersey Shore Star Ronnie Ortiz-Magro’s Ex Jen Harley Reunites with Infant Daughter After Arrest  The source also confirmed that a mutual friend stepped in to take care of the exes’ infant daughter, noting that “everybody is so fearful for this baby.”  According to the source, Ortiz-Magro had been “trying his best” to make things work with Harley for the sake of their daughter.  “If the kid wasn’t involved, it would be over,” said the source. “He’s constantly trying to make it work for the sake of his daughter. But we’re hopeful this is the final straw and he doesn’t put himself and his daughter back in danger.”  On Tuesday, Ortiz-Magro flew from Las Vegas to New Jersey with his daughter to resume filming season 2 of Jersey Shore Family Vacation.  Ronnie Ortiz-Magro/Instagram  Ronnie Ortiz-Magro/Instagram  The proud dad documented the trip on Instagram, sharing a photo of Ariana with the hashtags #HappyBaby #ShesExcitedToMeetTheRestOfHerNY/NJFamily.  “Someone’s excited to go to #Jersey,” he wrote, adding the hashtag #FistPumpinLikeChamps.

"Despite the whoring and arguably gratuitous nudity in ‘Book of the Stranger’, this week’s episode was refreshingly positive for female characters, and ranks alongside ‘Home’ in quality and story progression.  It makes sense to begin at the beginning: specifically the long awaited Sansa-John reunion. A sensible decision by the writers to forego yet another ‘missed them by that much’ moment helped spark life into the plot of the North, and saved this particular sub-plot from becoming any more farcical. It was a warm moment – it felt almost inevitable that somebody’s head or genitalia would roll across the screen at some point. Thankfully not.  Apparently Jon’s been listening to Elliott Smith songs on repeat since his resurrection and thinking about the human condition, as the hurting hero seemed averse to any further violence, even to save his own family. Enter Sansa. Who knows what should be credited for the maturation of the Stark girl – there are plenty of qualifying tragedies in her arc – but she was on impressive form. Her stern persuasiveness ensured that viewers will eventually get to see ‘Bastardbowl’ – the internet’s preferred nomenclature for any battle between Snow and Bolton. Unfortunately, given her new found confidence, it would be unsurprising to see Sansa finally meet her maker(s) this season. For now, though, her transformation is welcome.  Not to be overshadowed, Brienne shone at Castle Black, too. Melisandre and Ser Davos played no real part in the episode, besides being in receipt of Brienne’s barbs regarding her execution of Stannis. There was overt sexual tension between herself and Tormund, too, in a quasi-fetish dinner scene.  The next stop for ‘Book of the Stranger’ was somewhere in the proximity of the Vale. Little Finger’s falcon will hopefully peck out the eyes of the endlessly irritating young lord, Robin. Flippancy aside, the decision to ‘help’ Sansa and Jon in their battle versus Ramsay revealed little in terms of motive, other than that Baelish must see success in the future of House Stark.  On to Meereen, where Tyrion appeared to badly misrepresent his new queen. Making peace with the masters of Slaver’s Bay may have been diplomatic, but is unlikely to endear himself to Danaerys, and received dreadful feedback from Grey Worm and Missandei.  Jorah was frankly pathetic in this episode as his greyscale caught up with him, and the unbearably smug Daario played bodyguard for his love rival as a result. Having traveled so far, it nicely summarised the episode that, rather than being slung over their shoulders, Danaerys chose self-determination and relegated the two noble soldiers to doormen.  In much the same way as Sansa, Margaery was the stronger sibling in King’s Landing. Not to fall prey to the silver tongue of the High Sparrow, she instead attempts to manipulate him, reciting verses from The Seven-Pointed Star. Sent, she believes, to break her brother, she instead encourages him to stay strong. Sadly, these attempts may have been in vain; indeed, it looks to have been the High Sparrow’s intention for her instead to be broken by her brother, sucked in by his weakness.  With Tommen being manipulated every which way by everybody and their dog in King’s Landing, Lady Tyrell’s decision to introduce her army to the fray was encouraging. With her actions and Cersei’s we saw yet more decisiveness on the part of the show’s female characters.  A short visit to the Iron Islands saw Theon returning to his sister (who he previously unceremoniously pleasured, much to her amusement). After a frosty introduction, where Yara told her brother stop being such a wimp, Theon lent his support to her claim to the throne.  Back across the sea, Ramsay sat in Winterfell, badly peeling an apple. Enter Osha, who tried to seduce and assassinate him, only to find her own neck irrigating the cobbled ground. This was an anti-climax in her arc, as her lengthy disappearance quickly became non-existence. Nevertheless, it was a typically belligerent death for the Wildling, as she displayed her loyalty for one last time. In other news, Ramsay sent a threatening letter to Jon Snow which read like an homage to a cyber bully.  The resurgence of the Khaleesi which brought about the end of the episode was a relief, in as much as it injected life into her story line (ironically through a lot of death). It has been described as cathartic and climactic, but it did not really deserve such high praise. While the scene itself played well, there had been so little substance in the build-up that it felt sudden, as opposed to a culmination. A few unseemly rape jokes were not enough to develop this story of vengeance. Nonetheless, the event will serve as a catalyst, as Danaerys may well command the biggest army in the Seven Kingdoms. It can only be a matter of time until she travels to Westeros.  4.5/5  Dir: Jeremy Bodeswa  Scr: David Benioff, George R.R. Martin, D.B.

"IT'S the ultimate fairy tale romance - the glamorous American actress marries the handsome British prince.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their engagement a year ago today and a whole lot has happened since then.  Reuters 25 Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are celebrating the wedding anniversary of their engagement announcement today  The couple revealed that Harry had proposed on November 27, 2017, just over a year after Kensington Palace first confirmed their relationship.  Meghan, 37, and 34-year-old Harry married at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on May 19.  They're now expecting their first child together, due in spring.

"Christina Aguilera celebrated the release of new album Liberation by donning a disguise and busking in the New York subway alongside Jimmy Fallon on Thursday’s Tonight Show. Midway through the episode, the singer’s eighth studio LP officially arrived, as Fallon told Aguilera during the interview.  Aguilera wore a wig and a face-obscuring hat for the incognito performance, which has become a viral staple for the Tonight Show; previous “buskers” include Maroon 5 and U2.  However, the disguises are pretty much for naught as, within 10 seconds into their cover of Aretha Franklin’s “Think,” it’s evident that the voice booming out of this subway performer is unmistakably Aguilera’s. Before the buskers even hit the first chorus, a throng of passersby stop and whip out their cellphones to capture the unique performance.  With the ruse obviously up, Fallon and Aguilera shed the costumes and continued to entertain the congregators with an acoustic rendition of the singer’s Stripped single “Fighter.”  Aguilera offered up a third Tonight Show performance – this time in Rockefeller Center as opposed to under it – with the Liberation single “Fall in Line”:",0

"It's been slammed as ""creepy and lecherous""--but is it really that bad?  (Photo: Patrick Demarchelier/Vanity Fair)  Aussie bombshell Margot Robbie is on the cover of the August issue of Vanity Fair looking every bit the blonde goddess that she is.  However, the accompanying story, ""Welcome to the Summer of Margot Robbie,"" by Rich Cohen, has been widely criticized for insulting Australians and even being ""creepy and lecherous."" Yikes. Well, at least no one is criticizing the stunning images that ran with it.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  (Photo: Patrick Demarchelier/Vanity Fair)  (Photo: Patrick Demarchelier/Vanity Fair)  (Photo: Patrick Demarchelier/Vanity Fair)  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  (Photo: Patrick Demarchelier/Vanity Fair)  (Photo: Patrick Demarchelier/Vanity Fair)  Looks great, right? Problem is, the accompanying article has definitely rankled a lot of folks, including Robbie's fellow Australians:  Cohen has also been savaged on Twitter for the way he writes about Robbie, which some say overly sexualizes the admittedly very sexy Wolf of Wall Street star.  But clearly, some comments are being wrongly criticized for being “creepy,” when they actually aren't all that horrifying.  “I don’t remember what she was wearing, but it was simple, her hair combed around those painfully blue eyes. We sat in the corner. She looked at me and smiled.”  This? Totally normal. Was she supposed to frown?  “We sat for a moment in silence. She was thinking of something; I was thinking of something else.”  OK, it's perhaps not the most delicate way to phrase it, but this doesn't necessarily mean he's thinking about something sexual. But then again maybe Cohen was thinking about how sexy Margot Robbie looked sitting in front of him. Can you really blame him?  Then again, some comments actually were a little strange.  “She can be sexy and composed even while naked but only in character.”  ???  “As I said, she is from Australia. To understand her, you should think about what that means.”  Is Cohen saying he can’t understand her because of her accent? Maybe hasn’t watched that oddly riveting video where she explains Aussie slang.  While it’s understandable that the story struck a nerve, it’s also not the most offensive celebrity interview of recent times. It's not even that offensive, if you think about it.  Let's not forget that Margot Robbie is an absolute babe, and Cohen, who recently wrote for HBO's now-canceled Vinyl, was just a guy trying to keep his shit together in the presence of her undeniable greatness. (Though he's on his own with the Australian stuff).  Moral of the story? There's really no need to collectively lose our minds over the Vanity Fair story on Margot Robbie. Thank you and goodnight.",1
"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will officially be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel in...  Deal or No Deal  ...and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  While there was plenty of royal news that flooded our inboxes this week, we were most excited about getting an update on Meghan's wedding dress! We already knew that she had selected a dress designer (thanks to her stylist-turned-pal, Jessica Mulroney), but now we know what she'll be wearing on her special day is officially in the design process!  A source told ET earlier this week that Meghan has already met with the dress designer, and is busy adding unique touches to the couple's big day.  We also found out that the Los Angeles native has been appointed a secretary to handle her increasingly busy royal schedule and duties. Amy Pickerill, a former Kensington Palace press officer, was announced on Monday as the new assistant private secretary in the office of Prince Harry.  As for Meghan and Prince Harry's actual wedding day, expect a lot of security. Ken Wharfe, the late Princess Diana's former bodyguard, told ET on Thursday that police will make sure nothing is overlooked for the massive occasion, and no expense will be spared.  ""From my own experiences -- and speaking to colleagues within the last few weeks -- Scotland Yard and neighboring police forces that will be part of this operation will be only too aware of how important it is to make sure that no stone is left unturned, and you know, one talks in this day of austerity of finance,"" he said. ""Trust me on this occasion, finance has nothing to do with this. Scotland Yard, together with Thames Valley Police -- which will be policing this event -- money is not an object, and they make sure that the very best of security is put on display to make sure that security is not compromised.""  And after the soon-to-be-married couple's anthrax scare last Monday, we wouldn't be surprised if there's even more heightened security as they continue their royal duties ahead of their nuptials.  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  Looks like Megan and Kate Middleton have been spending even more quality time together! The former Suits star often goes from her Nottingham Cottage to Kate's humble abode to have tea or exchange advice, according to US Weekly.  “[Meghan] shares tips she’s read about healthy eating,"" a source told the publication.  And while it's not a rumor, it seems as if people are comparing Meghan to Princess Diana more and more frequently. According to multiple reports, the bride-to-be has been making secret visits to comfort victims of the Grenfell Tower, much like when Diana would also sneak away from Kensington Palace to visit hospital patients.  ""Meghan's visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts,"" one community member, who met the soon-to-be-royal, told E!  OUT AND ABOUT  After making a trip to Scotland, Meghan and Harry took a break from the spotlight this week -- but did have time for a fun date night.  The engaged couple attended a Hamilton show at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London's West End last Friday night. One of the show's cast members, Leslie Garcia Bowman, even took to Twitter to express his excitement over having the couple in attendance.  Was an honour to have Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in to watch @HamiltonWestEnd last night! — Leslie Garcia Bowman (@lesliegbowman) February 17, 2018  SERVIN' UP SUITS  If you've been following along with our royals countdown each week, then you're well aware that we've been binge-watching Meghan's show, Suits, since the beginning. This week, we were super happy to see Meghan, who plays aspiring lawyer Rachel Zane, try on an Anne Barge wedding gown during the ""Cold Feet"" episode of season 5.  When the episode originally aired on the USA network last year, Meghan spoke with Glamour, revealing some of her personal favorite bridal styles.  ""Delphine Manivet and Christos Costarellos are faves of mine for their uniqueness and beauty,"" she gushed at the time. ""I will always be a fan of Ellie Saab. J. Mendel is spectacular as well, especially for more structural designs.""  Watch Meghan model her character's wedding dress in the video below:  SPARKLE LIKE MARKLE  Because our muscles are still kinda hating us from trying Meghan's favorite Pilates class last week (more on that HERE), we decided to take it easy this time by having a ""treat yourself"" night. We sat back, relaxed and drank like Meghan. Yes, turns out, girl loves a good wine!  ""God, do I love wine; a beautiful full red or a crisp white,"" she revealed in an interview with The New Potato in 2013. ""But if it’s cocktails, I love a spicy tequila cocktail, negroni, or good scotch (neat).""

The seven-month pregnant Duchess of Cambridge looked exquisite at the 2018 BAFTAs, Britain's equivalent to the Oscars, on Feb. 18.  The expecting mother donned a dark green Jenny Packham gown with cap-sleeves and a black ribbon to accentuate her baby bump.

The Duchess began her week alongside Sophie Countess of Wessex, by hosting the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace. The brunette beauty arrived wearing a black-and-white floral print Erdem lace dress with black heels, and talked to designers and artisans from around the Commonwealth about their work.

There, they put on hard hats and reflective vests as they ventured to the Northern Spire, a new bridge over the River Wear that is scheduled to open later this year.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Queen Elizabeth II also had quite the interesting week! Her Majesty graced fashionistas with her presence at London Fashion Week, where she presented the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design to Richard Quinn. The 91-year-old head of the monarchy looked enthusiastic as she sat front row next to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour at the emerging British designer's runway show.  Queen Elizabeth was sophisticatedly dressed in a powder blue Angela Kelly skirt and matching jacket with black gloves and a chic handbag.  Yui Mok - Pool/Getty Images  Lastly, what we've all been waiting for will finally happen. The Fab Four -- Kate, William, Meghan and Harry -- will all attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum on Wednesday. And you can bet we'll be going all out for the royal couple's first engagement together since Christmas!  And that's a wrap on your weekly royals update.

"Happy anniversary Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi!  Nine years ago on Wednesday, the couple tied the knot. And in celebration of their anniversary, DeGeneres, 59, shared a loving tribute to Instagram!  “@PortiadeRossi and I got married 9 years ago today,” the Ellen DeGeneres Show host captioned a smiling, black-and-white photo of the pair on their wedding day. “Being her wife is the greatest thing I am.”  Singer Joshua Radin, who performed at the couple’s wedding, also took to the photo and video-sharing app to celebrate their union.  “Nine years ago today, these two incredible women got married and asked me to sing some of my songs to them while they were celebrating their most special day. It’s still one of the most fun things I’ve ever done,” Radin wrote. “Happy anniversary @theellenshow and @portiaderossi.”  During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, de Rossi recalled about falling for DeGeneres. “We actually met socially and I just felt that immediate draw,” she said. “We did talk a little bit and then over those three years, we saw each other at parties or at various things, but the one time that was the most significant was during a photoshoot actually.”  She continued: “I just walked over to say hello to her, and I couldn’t believe it, but she turned around and it was like an arrow was shot through my heart. I felt weak at the knees and I was overwhelmed with how I felt, but then it took me about 10 months to get the courage up to actually do anything about it.”  FROM PEN: Jada Pinkett Smith Talks Celebrating 20 Years with Will Smith  In a 2008 episode of her talk show, DeGeneres announced her plans to wed de Rossi; the reveal followed the news that the California Supreme Court had struck down a law banning same-sex marriage. The happy couple later showed off their engagement bling on the Daytime Emmys red carpet that same year.  That August, the couple tied the knot with an intimate ceremony in their L.A. home. (To see more of their cute moments from throughout the years, click here).  “Portia and I constantly say to each other, ‘We are so lucky.’ Sometimes it’s lying in bed at night before I go to sleep, and I just say thank you to whatever, whoever is out there,” DeGeneres told PEOPLE in her 2016 cover story. “I’ve gotten to a place where I really am just settled. Really. I know that I’m not going anywhere. She’s not going anywhere. I’m not saying the relationship took a while; I’m saying in my life, it took a while to find this.”",0

"When I was a young lass, I—like many of my peers—was a hardcore fan of The Hills. I loved the show so much that I would excuse myself from many a boy-girl hangout to settle in at home for one glorious hour of classic Los Angeles dramz, while updating my BBM status (“*~Watching The Hills! Do not disturb!~*”).  If this Monday night setup sounds familiar (hi, everyone born in the ’90s), I have some great news: Kristin Cavallari has a spinoff reality show called Very Cavallari and it. is. AMAZING. And by that, I mean: It’s terrible, but I can’t look away.  It’s been eight years since The Hills went off the air. Kristin Cavallari is now 31 and married to former pro football player Jay Cutler. They live with their three kids (Camden, Jaxon and Saylor) in a mansion in Nashville. In the first Very Cavallari episode, which is available in its entirety on YouTube, we learn that Kristen and Jay don’t want their kids to be on TV against their will. Instead, the show focuses on Kristin trying to jumpstart her jewellery/home goods store Uncommon James, interspersed with some weirdly mean “banter” between her and the always-bored looking Jay.  If it sounds extremely mediocre, that’s because it is. The storylines are slow moving, the characters are largely one-dimensional and by the end of episode 1, everyone has looked directly into the camera at least once. And yet, I am glued to my screen for each hour-long episode—and I think it’s because I’m so damn nostalgic for The Hills.  Herewith, all the ways Kristin Cavallari’s new show—which airs Sundays on E!—is scratching my itch for Lauren Conrad and co.  The gang’s all here  The ladies of Nashville are relentlessly dramatic and the dudes are either total cheeseballs or totally mean. Sound familiar?  Just like Lauren Conrad on The Hills, Kristin Cavallari is the show’s fearless leader. She is determined to make it big in the jewellery/home goods biz and she has very little time for anything else. Cavallari hired Shannon, Reagan and Brittainy to work at the shop, effectively forcing three very loud personalities into a teeny-tiny office space—aka exactly how Lauren and Whitney got into so many workplace squabbles as Teen Vogue interns and later at the PR firm, People’s Revolution.  In place of Audrina, we have Shannon, who is a total flirt and ultimately the show’s shit disturber. Although she’s the social media manager for Uncommon James, Shannon makes it very clear that she has zero interest in actually working. Reagan—who is more of a Stephanie Pratt, IMO—is a huge space cadet (she calls herself “the blonde with the big tits”) and I have no idea what she does for the company. Thus far, I’ve seen her try to buy snacks for a photo shoot and opt for, among other selections, an uncut watermelon with no knife. And then there’s Brittainy, the no-nonsense store manager and the Whitney of the bunch. In short, each are a special kind of exhausting, and they make great TV.  Jay Cutler is—as Kristin’s old faux, Lauren, would say—a “very sucky person.” As far as I can tell, all he’s been doing since stepping back from the NFL is driving his children to and from school and complaining about it in between. Oh, and he spends a lot of time watching live feeds of deer in the wild. I’m serious.  Meanwhile, Shannon is dating a corny singer-songwriter who just wants to make it big. His name is John Gurney and he spends most of his time crooning about how Shannon’s beauty makes him insecure and storming out of bars when he gets mad at her. In a fun twist, Gurney (as he is lovingly called) is BFFs with Brittainy’s boo, Jon Stone, described in the show as a “Nashville music legend.”  And that is the entire cast of characters, simple and beautiful, just like the drama they create. Just what the OG Hills success recipe calls for!  They are constantly gossiping in a dimly lit club  From Audrina and Justin Bobby discussing their tumultuous relationship over double rum and Cokes, to LC screaming at Heidi with a gin and tonic splashing around in her hand (“you know what you did!”), the bar was where all the magic of The Hills happened. Eight years later and Kristin Cavallari might be a mom, but she still hits up the club when she wants to dish.  Most often heading out on the town with her BFF/makeup artist-hairstylist-wardrobe director-lifestyle blogger-podcast host Kelly Henderson, Kristin rarely has anything of interest to talk about. But throw in some loud music and a couple snazzy ’fits, and I’ll watch them gossip about nada for hours. On the flip, Shannon and Reagan love to drink. It’s one of the things they most often talk about—Reagan even claims to be the best version of herself when she’s hungover—and it’s one of their favourite past times. In episode 2, they invite their friends to “Sunday Funday” and you follow them on their journey to a very emotional Sunday evening via a montage of bottomless mimosas and tequila shots. It’s on this night that Gurney gets mad at Shannon for flirting with this other guy, Wirth, who also works at the store.  Any good reality show knows that where there’s alcohol, there’s drama. Very Cavallari is no different, and it’s peak entertainment.  They all have wildly unprofitable “jobs” which act as a front for their real careers (read: making all the dramz for TV)  By episode 2, it becomes clear that Uncommon James exists solely online (although there’s now a bricks and mortar location IRL). They only have one model (Taylor, who is also on the show) and they rely heavily on making sales through Instagram ads, as evidenced by how many times Shannon has been yelled at for slacking.  This can all only mean one thing: Uncommon James isn’t bringing in the big bucks, Very Cavallari is. If you recall, The Hills producers were masters at this masquerade, getting Lauren, Audrina and Heidi high-profile jobs with the flick of a producer’s wand. While the show and its cast maintained that these jobs were real, a few plot holes revealed otherwise.  The great thing about this is that the core four (Kristen, Shannon, Reagan and Brittainy) are consistently jamming their loud personalities into high pressure situations, making for excellent television with The Hills‘s villain at the helm.  While my fave reality show had its moments, I think we all need to accept that The Hills was grade A, early 2000s garbage. From manufactured melees over ex-boyfriends to the façade of financial struggle, literally nothing about the MTV hit was real (despite show-leader Lauren Conrad’s insistence that it was)—but that’s what made it so damn interesting to watch. It was a weird trial run in fantasy being portrayed as actuality, the storylines veering as dramatically as they would in a soap, with all the authority of a documentary.  Since The Hills went off the air, I’ve moved past my obsession with straightened side bangs and Taylor Swift, but my taste in television has remained virtually the same. All I ask out of “reality” TV is that it makes me gasp, and on that front, Very Cavallari is killing it.  If you loved The Hills as much as I did, Very Cavallari will feel like the next best thing.

"Actor calls former co-star’s remarks about ‘spectrum of behaviour’ in sexual misconduct ‘Orwellian’ and questions defence of disgraced comedian Louis CK  The actor Minnie Driver has told the Guardian that men “simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level” and should not therefore attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women.    Clarence Thomas accuser Anita Hill to spearhead fight against harassment in Hollywood Read more  Driver was discussing comments by Matt Damon, whom she once dated and with whom she starred in the Oscar-winning 1997 film Good Will Hunting. In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved “a spectrum of behaviour”.  Damon said there was “a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.”    He added that society was in a “watershed moment” and said it was “wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it’s totally necessary”. But he said: “We live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, ‘Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.’”  In her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: “God God, seriously?    “Gosh it’s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women’s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.”  Driver’s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: “There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it’s still cancer.”  On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: “I felt I desperately needed to say something. I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.  “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.”  Driver’s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape.  Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response.  “That’s the sign of somebody who – well, we can work with that,” Damon said, adding: “I don’t know Louis CK. I’ve never met him. I’m a fan of his, but I don’t imagine he’s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... ”  Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon.  “I don’t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,” she said. “It seems to me that he thinks that because he didn’t rape somebody – so far as we know – that what he did do wasn’t as bad.”  The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said “these stories are true” but did not specifically apologise.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP  “That’s a problem,” Driver continued. “If good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we’re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.”  Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand.  “I felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,” she said. “Put abuse in there … that all abuse is equal but some is worse.”  She added: “There is no hierarchy of abuse – that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn’t want or ask for … you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other.  “And it certainly can’t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency.  Peter Jackson: I blacklisted Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino under pressure from Weinstein Read more  “How about: it’s all fucking wrong and it’s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it’s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not. Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.”  Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein.  “There is not a woman I know,” Driver said, “myself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn’t sleep with.”  Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women.  “In the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,” she said, “I feel that’s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question.  “Men can rally and they can support, but I don’t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse. Ever.”",0

"Serena Williams is two victories shy of breaking the record for most individual tennis grand slams all-time. She’s been the dominant force of her sport for two decades, and it seems no one will be able to stand the way of her quest in overtaking Margaret Court’s 24 grand slams.  Except maybe for a second baby.  In an interview with In Style magazine, the 36-year-old new mom says a second child would possibly send her into retirement. But she’ll have to discuss it with husband Alexis Ohanian first.  “I don’t know if I want to play if I have another baby, but you’re right. I need to talk to Alexis. We need a plan,” Williams said.  She also said, “If I weren’t working, I’d already be pregnant.”  Williams appears as the cover story for the magazine’s first-ever “Badass Women” issue. She talks about her first year of motherhood, how she and Reddit co-founder Ohanian hooked up, attending the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and, of course, all things badass.  Which women does Williams place in the badass category? They would be Beyonce, Rihanna and Kate Middleton.  And her own No. 1 badass moment involves her 10-month-old daughter, Olympia. Williams was nine weeks pregnant with Olympia in January 2017 when she won the Australian Open by ousting older sister Venus Williams in straight sets. It was Serena’s 23rd singles grand slam title.  “I had a really tough first round and an even tougher second round. I thought, ‘I’m probably going to lose early. That’s OK. I have a good excuse for the first time.'”  She consulted with a doctor about withdrawing from the tournament, but she was cleared to play with a warning to be careful on hot days.  “I was literally nine weeks by the end of the tournament. I was almost done with my first trimester,” she said. “Every day that passed I thought, ‘This is a dream.’ It was like an animated Disney movie. And by the time the quarterfinals came, I was like, ‘I know I can beat this girl,’ and at the semifinals I thought, ‘I know I can win this match.’ I didn’t think I would win the final, so when I won, it was like, ‘OK, this is crazy.'”  Get more celebrity news and photos delivered to your inbox for free on weekdays.

Williams says tennis has been pushed to the background as she and Olympia have fallen into a daily routine.  “So I feed her, and then she snuggles with me, which is the best part of my day,” she said. “Then we play, and after that I sneak away to practice, usually around 8 a.m. The only rule I have at practice is to be done at 1 p.m., because as much as I love tennis, I need to be with her.”  Related Articles ‘Watch What Happens Live’ host Andy Cohen to become dad  Audrey Geisel, widow of Dr. Seuss, dead at 97  Barack Obama appears on Miranda’s latest ‘Hamilton’ song  Michelle Obama can wear whatever she wants now, and what she wants is sparkly thigh-high boots  Oprah Winfrey reminds Academy voters of ‘Black Panther’ and its Oscar-worthiness Williams also spoke about becoming fascinated by Silicon Valley because of Ohanian.  “I didn’t know his world at all, but I’ve always been tech-savvy,” she said. “I had a few investments before I met him, and I wanted to know more. So we started talking, just as friends. Just casually chatting. I was getting hot when he was talking about it all. So after that we just continued talking, and then, I don’t know — I love his world.”",0
"Noah Cyrus may not be as famous as her older sister, Miley, but the next few months could be a gamechanger for the budding singer.  The 17-year-old will join Carly Rae Jepsen and Purity Ring as the opening acts for Katy Perry on the North American leg of her Witness tour, which kicks off in Montreal Sept. 19. The schedule was pushed back “due to unavoidable production delays,” Perry revealed Thursday via social media.  Cyrus, who released her debut single “Make Me (Cry)” earlier this year and garnered an MTV VMA nod for “Best New Artist,” gushed about the opportunity to perform ahead of the “Roar” singer for 21 dates on her tour.  “I’ve loved Katy since I was a little girl, and I can’t thank her enough for giving me this incredible opportunity,” the teen said. “Let’s hope I don’t f–k it up.”  Earlier this week, Miley Cyrus released the music video for her latest single, “Younger Now,” with the younger Cyrus expected to drop a full LP later this year.

"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.",0
"Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are separating after nearly nine years of marriage.  The former couple announced the split in a joint statement exclusive to PEOPLE:  “Hey world!  So…We have something we would like to share.  First off, it feels odd that we have to share this kind of thing with everyone, but it’s a consequence of the lives we’ve chosen to lead, which we also happen to be deeply grateful for. We’re living in an incredible moment in time, but it’s also a time where truth can easily get distorted into “alternative facts” 😉 So we want to share the truth so you know that if you didn’t read it here then it’s most certainly fiction.  We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly. We won’t be commenting beyond this, and we thank you all in advance for respecting our family’s privacy. Sending lots of love to everyone, Chan&Jenna.”  The actors, both 37, have one child together — daughter Everly — who will turn 5 in May.  The couple most recently attended the Kids’ Choice Awards together where Tatum hit the stage to promote his new animated movie Smallfoot.  They first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up and began dating shortly after before tying the knot in 2009.  Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan have split. The last attended a red carpet together in November (pictured) Greg Doherty/Getty  Buzz about a split began when Dewan Tatum attended the annual Vanity Fair Oscars after-party solo, but she told ET at the bash that Tatum was on daddy duty and “so happy to have a night off.”  And in mid-March the former couple shared sweet snaps from a face painting session with their daughter. “When you fall asleep around a toddler,” Dewan Tatum captioned a silly shot of Tatum before sharing a solo selfie of her own look.

Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum Channing Tatum/Instagram  In February, the actress opened up to Health about the perception that she and Tatum had a “perfect life,” saying instead that they worked hard to keep their relationship going.  “When people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one’s perfect,” she said. “I think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we’ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.”  Dave Benett/WireImage  Dewan Tatum said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn’t get along.  “But I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,” she continued. “We’ve always had the same values. But we’re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don’t really like each other.”  RELATED VIDEO: Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan ‘Have Lovingly Chosen to Separate’ After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage  In December, Tatum wished his wife a happy birthday with a heartfelt Instagram post.  “This creature is one more year beautiful.

Your strength and grace ever-evolving,” he wrote. “By doing so you make everything around you grow- everything. And I am so very grateful for your lessons. Happy life day my love.”",0

"Follow­ing therap­y, actor has come to realis­e that Jen was the love of his life  Fans who’ve been rooting for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston ever since their 2005 split may actually have cause for hope! Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

"Is Robsten back from the dead? Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson reunited and got ‘Twilight’ fans buzzing, but we’ve EXCLUSIVELY learned if these two exes are getting back together or not.  For one moment, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan was once again a couple and all was right in the world for Twilight fans. Ex-lovers Robert Pattinson, 28, and Kristen Stewart, 32, attended Lily-Rose Depp’s 19th birthday party on June 1. However, don’t expect their love to rise from the grave. “There’s no chance of any kind of romantic reconciliation for Rob and Kristen,” a source close to Rob EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “That ship has well and truly sailed, and way too much has passed between them to ever reunite in that way. Plus, Kristen is really happy with Stella [Maxwell], they have an amazing relationship.”  While there’s no chance that RPatz and KStew will date again, it’s not all bad, as the source tells HollywoodLife.com that Rob thinks it’s “great” that they’ve “finally got to a place where they can be friendly when they see each other in public. Rob would love to see more of Kristen, he still cares for her deep down, and probably always will—she was his first real love.” As for Kristen, she “feels a little awkward when she sees Rob,” because she still “carries a lot of guilt” from how their romance ended (you know, what with her cheating on him with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders.) However, the source says that Rob has repeatedly told her that “everything is good between them, and he doesn’t harbor any bad feelings towards her.”  Too bad, Twilight fans. Bella’s not getting back with Edward – or Jacob, for that matter. This should come as no surprises, as the two didn’t really seem to be that enamored with each other at Lily-Rose’s birthday party, as a source from the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles – where the bash was held – EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that they had “very cordial conversations, but it was minimal at best.” Oh, there was no drama – but there was no real chemistry either. Oh well.  Prior to the birthday bash, Robert and Kristen had a “low-key meet-up” in February 2018. Both Twilight stars were at a bar/restaurant in Los Angeles’ Silver Lake neighborhood. Eagle-eyed fans tweeted their excitement, hoping that they could “maybe start over again …but this time it means forever.” Sadly for these fans, the only way they can see Bella and Edward back together is in the pages of Stephenie Meyer’s books.",1

Dubbed the Oscars of the East, the annual Met Gala was held on May 7, themed ""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination"" to celebrate the Metropolitan Museum of Art's newest exhibition at the Costume Institute.  With 180 pieces on display, featuring high-end, expensive designers from Versace and Valentino to Dolce & Gabbana and Chanel, the exhibition focuses on the ""dialogue between fashion and the masterworks of religious art.""  Helmed by Vogue's Anna Wintour (and co-chaired this year by Rihanna, Donatella Versace, and Amal Clooney), the Met Gala is known for its best-dressed and worst-dressed celebrities, socialites, and businesspeople who walk the red carpet in their interpretation of the theme.  Anyone who is anyone is there, at least according to Wintour's handpicked and closely scrutinized guest list.  And this year's guests didn't disappoint, from Rihanna's pope-inspired ensemble dripping in diamonds to Blake Lively walking the red carpet in $2 million worth of jewelry.  The cost to make an appearance during fashion's biggest night out is a steep one, and the cost to make the event happen is even bigger. For $30,000 a ticket, those who passed Wintour's approval can attend the $3.5 million event.

"The 'Star Trek' icon denies a claim by Scott R. Brunton, who says he was groped at the actor's Los Angeles condo.  A former model and actor is accusing Star Trek icon George Takei of sexual assault in 1981. The accuser, Scott R. Brunton, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, claims that Takei took advantage of him when he was most vulnerable.  ""This happened a long time ago, but I have never forgotten it,"" Brunton tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. ""It is one of those stories you tell with a group of people when people are recounting bizarre instances in their lives, this always comes up. I have been telling it for years, but I am suddenly very nervous telling it.""  Brunton says he was living in Hollywood in 1981, working as a waiter and beginning a career as a commercial actor and model when he met a 43- or 44-year-old Takei one evening at Greg's Blue Dot bar. The men exchanged numbers and would call one another from time to time as well as run into each other at clubs, Brunton says. When Brunton broke up with his then-boyfriend, he spoke with Takei. ""He said, 'Let me know what your new number is' and I did. And not long after we broke up and I moved out, George called me,"" Brunton recalls.  Takei, as Brunton tells it, invited him to dinner and the theater. ""He was very good at consoling me and understanding that I was upset and still in love with my boyfriend,"" Brunton says. ""He was a great ear. He was very good about me spilling my heart on my sleeve.""  The two men went back to the actor's condo for a drink the same night. ""We have the drink and he asks if I would like another,"" Brunton recalls. ""And I said sure. So, I have the second one, and then all of a sudden, I begin feeling very disoriented and dizzy, and I thought I was going to pass out. I said I need to sit down and he said sit over here and he had the giant yellow beanbag chair. So I sat down in that and leaned my head back and I must have passed out.""  ""The next thing I remember I was coming to and he had my pants down around my ankles and he was groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off and feeling me up at the same time, trying to get his hands down my underwear,"" Brunton says. ""I came to and said, 'What are you doing?!' I said, 'I don't want to do this.' He goes, 'You need to relax. I am just trying to make you comfortable. Get comfortable.' And I said, 'No. I don't want to do this.' And I pushed him off and he said, 'OK, fine.' And I said I am going to go and he said, 'If you feel you must. You're in no condition to drive.' I said, 'I don't care I want to go.' So I managed to get my pants up and compose myself and I was just shocked. I walked out and went to my car until I felt well enough to drive home, and that was that.""  THR spoke to four longtime friends of Brunton — Norah Roadman, Rob Donovan, Stephen Blackshear and Jan Steward — who said that he had confided in them about the Takei encounter years ago.  Takei's rep, Julia Buchwald, told THR, ""George is traveling in Japan and Australia and not reachable for comment."" Takei, now 80, rose to fame playing Hikaru Sulu on the original Star Trek television series. He is also an author and activist and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights.  In a series of tweets and in a Facebook post Saturday morning, Takei denied the allegations.  ""The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now. I have wracked my brain to ask if I remember Mr. Brunton, and I cannot say I do,"" he said. ""Right now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago. But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful.""  Brunton claims that he met up with Takei years after the incident in Portland, Brunton's current home, while the actor was there on a book tour. ""I wanted to see him,"" Brunton says. ""I always wanted to ask him — I just felt really betrayed. I thought I was a friend and here I am later, just another piece of meat. So I called him up at the hotel — I figured out which hotel he was at — and he said 'Hi, Scott. I remember you.' I wanted to ask him why. We met for coffee, and I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It was just too uncomfortable.""  Brunton says he considered going to the media with the story for years, but he assumed no one would take him seriously. ""Who's going to believe me? It's my word against his,"" he says.  Brunton's reasoning changed after the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and specifically when Takei spoke out regarding allegations leveled against Kevin Spacey.  On Oct. 29, Anthony Rapp, an actor starring in the latest Star Trek series, claimed to BuzzFeed News that Spacey sexually assaulted him while he was a minor in 1986. Spacey later apologized and came out as gay in response. ""When power is used in a non-consensual situation, it is a wrong,"" Takei said of the Spacey claim in a statement to THR on Oct. 30. ""For Anthony Rapp, he has had to live with the memory of this experience of decades ago. For Kevin Spacey, who claims not to remember the incident, he was the older, dominant one who had his way. Men who improperly harass or assault do not do so because they are gay or straight — that is a deflection. They do so because they have the power, and they chose to abuse it.""  Brunton says he found Takei's response infuriating. ""I don't want anything from him but an apology,"" he says. ""I am sure he'll disown all this, I don't know, maybe not.""  Friends,    I'm writing to respond to the accusations made by Scott R. Bruton. I want to assure you all that I am as shocked and bewildered at these claims as you must feel reading them. /1 — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 11, 2017  The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now. I have wracked my brain to ask if I remember Mr. Brunton, and I cannot say I do. /2 — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 11, 2017  But I do take these claims very seriously, and I wanted to provide my response thoughtfully and not out of the moment. /3 — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 11, 2017  Right now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago.

Yours in gratitude,    George /end — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 11, 2017  Updates:  Nov. 11, 7 a.m.: This story has been updated with remarks from Takei denying the allegations.",0

"The estate of Tony winner Jonathan Larson will exec produce the live musical of the HIV/AIDS-themed play. Marc Platt is also on board.  Fox has found its follow-up to Grease Live.  Following prolonged negotiations, Jonathan Larson's Tony-winning HIV/AIDS-themed musical Rent is set as the network's next live musical, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Larson's estate is on board to executive produce alongside Marc Platt (La La Land, Wicked). Rent marks Platt's latest live project for following NBC's Jesus Christ Superstar and Fox's newly announced A Christmas Story and last year's Grease. Additional auspices, as well as a premiere date and casting, will be announced later.  The rock musical, loosely based on La Boheme, tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in New York's East Village in the days of the Bohemian Alphabet City and under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning play was created by Larson, who died suddenly before Rent opened off-Broadway in 1996 and then moved to Broadway. Rent won Tony Awards for best musical, book of a musical and original score — all for Larson — and scored co-lead Wilson Jermaine Heredia a win for featured actor for his performance as Angel Dumott Schunard, a drag queen drummer with HIV/AIDS.  ""Rent​​ was Jonathan’s dream of sharing the ​theater and the passion he had for it with a whole new generation,” Julie and Al Larson said in a statement. “None of us could have imagined the massive impact that the messages and themes in Rent would have on the ​theater​ community or the world ... except for Jonathan. We are absolutely thrilled to be continuing Jonathan’s legacy and ​the still-relevant ​themes of ​the show in this way.”    The original Broadway cast also included Adam Pascal, Daphne-Rubin-Vega and Idina Menzel, who all collected Tony nominations, as well as Anthony Rapp, Jesse L. Martin and Taye Diggs.    ""We are so honored to partner with the estate of the brilliant Jonathan Larson and producer Marc Platt on one of the great musicals of our time,"" said Dana Walden and Gary Newman, chairmen and CEOs of Fox Television Group. ""The title is so iconic, the music is so beloved, and the themes are as meaningful today as they were when the show first premiered on Broadway. With Marc overseeing this project, we are sure it will have a profound impact on the legions of fans who know and love this musical.""  The production was adapted for the big screen in 2005 with Chris Columbus directing and produced by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, Columbus, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan. Stephen Chbosky adapted Larson's book, with nearly all of the original Broadway cast returning to reprise their roles. With a $40 million budget, the pic grossed a disappointing $31.6 million. The play marked its 20th anniversary in 2016 with a tour.  Fox's production will be exec produced by Platt, Adam Siegel, Julie Larson, Al Larson and Revolution Studios' Vince Totino, Scott Hemming and Marla Levine. The original production was produced by the New York Theatre Workshop and on Broadway by Jeffrey Seller, Kevin McCollum, Allan S. Gordon and the NYTW. Larson, for his part, also earned a Pulitzer Prize for the production.  Speaking with THR at the Emmys, Walden said Rent ""would be a dream — a dream your biggest dream"" to land as the network's next live production. ""That would be a title that's perfect for Fox and something that we could do in a meaningful way. Our network is distinguished by cutting-edge programming and being able to take subject matter — whether it was Glee or Shots Fired — I think our brand is perfect for that title. I would love it.""  Rent, with a legion of loyal and diehard fans, has big shoes to fill. Grease Live ranked third this year at the Emmys, collecting a total of five statuettes including for outstanding special class program and directing for Tony winner Thomas Kail (Hamilton).  The news comes after Fox announced A Christmas Story would air in December, opposite NBC and Jennifer Lopez with Bye Bye Birdie. NBC also noted this week that it would tackle Jesus Christ Superstar for Easter 2018. (There remains no word on NBC's A Few Good Men live production.)  Paradigm and Carol Contes of the Guzman Law Group brokered the deal.",0

""The Duchess travelled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s Hospital with The Duke of Cambridge.""

The Duchess travelled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s Hospital with The Duke of Cambridge. — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 23, 2018  While it was rumored that she had considered a home birth for her third child, Kate will deliver the baby in the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London, which has been preparing for weeks.  Not only has the outside of the wing had a new coat of paint, but parking restrictions have been in effect since April 9. Media positions went up on that date as well.  Crowds of both well-wishers and reporters are currently gathering outside the hospital, where Kate previously delivered both Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Princess Diana delivered both Prince William and Prince Harry in the hospital as well.  Regardless of whether this new child is a boy or a girl, it will be fifth in line to the throne, falling just after Princess Charlotte and just before Prince Harry.

When the new royal baby does arrive, an announcement will be made both via the Kensington Palace Twitter account, and on an easel outside Buckingham Palace, but until then, let the royal baby watch begin!",0

And on Wednesday, Ashley Tisdale celebrated that fact by wearing a bright pink vest with the words Beach Bum on the front in orange and blue capital letters as she dropped by the 901 Hair Salon in the West Hollywood district of Los Angeles.

"Teyana Taylor Tickled By Kanye West Dating Gossip, “[They] Got Me Die’N Over Here!”  R&B singer Teyana Taylor has responded to reports suggesting a romantic relationship between her and her new boss, Grammy-winning producer/rapper Kanye West.  Calling out gossip site Media Take Out, Taylor denied the allegations.  “ok…WOW @ MTO. and then WOW @ the ppl who really believed MTO,” she tweeted Monday (March 28).  “lmfaooooooooo this site got me die’n over here with the stories they tell!!! smh lol” (Teyana Taylor’s Twitter)  Reports of the two artists becoming more than friends hit the Internet early Monday.  Kanye West is now hooking up with Teyana Taylor reports MediaTakeOut. The site claims the rapper is head over heels for Taylor and her smoking bod. “Kanye was intrigued by her innocence, and her body,” an insider tells the site, adding, “[Teyana] must have put it on him, all [Kanye] talks about is her … he even signed her to a deal and is featuring her on his new album with Jay-Z.” We thought this rumor smelled fishy because – when is MTO ever correct about a dating story? Anyway, it looks like our suspicion was well placed. (RumorFix)  Earlier this month, female rapper Missy Elliott denied MTO reports connecting her to R&B singer Keri Hilson.  “@MissKeriBaby. Girl It amazes me how we never worked 2gether and barely know each other but they make up a full out lie! Smh!,” she tweeted Friday (March 18). (Missy Elliott’s Twitter)  A day prior to Elliott’s denial, Hilson also resorted to the social network to defend herself.  “Lies!! How do those ppl sleep at night? I love & respect Missy & her work, but we’ve never worked & I’ve prolly seen her 5 times in my life!,” she tweeted Thursday (March 17).

Just like Kylie, Khloe also reportedly feels really lonely while waiting to welcome her first child with basketball player boyfriend, Tristan Thompson. Much like her younger half-sister’s situation, it looks like Khloe’s road to motherhood is just a neverending nightmare.  The 33-year-old is apparently, ‘unmotivated’ and ‘tired’ all the time but that’s not all – she’s also very anxious and feels isolated in Tristan’s adopted hometown of Cleveland.  That is definitely not good for her or her baby, but she just can’t help it – she feels horrible!  ‘Her anxiety is going from bad to worse. She is lonely being away from her family,’ one source close to the Kardashian family revealed.  Khloe, who’s struggled with her body image and weight in the past is also devastated reading mean comments from fans that make fun of her curvier figure now that she is expecting.  ‘There is the body-shaming, which has been off the charts lately. She cannot wait for this pregnancy to be over and done with,’ the insider added.  In addition, Khloe has been suffering horrible morning sickness all throughout her first trimester and also often complains about her hair thinning to pals.  Similarly, Kylie Jenner is also expecting her first child, rumors say and is terrified of how much weight she has gained.  The pregnancy body is scaring her so much that she refuses to leave the house.  Advertisement  ‘She is at a very low point right now. She’s really bummed out,’ another insider told us about Kylie.",1

Mellie is summoned to testify to the scandalous Air Force Two hijacking. She initially denies any involvement in the hijacking but information on the death of president Rashad, forces her to plead the fifth. In despair, Jake tries to blackmail Olivia into throwing Mellie under the bus—she ends up exposing the existence of B613 to Lonnie Mencken. QPA also seems to have hit a dead end in trying to figure out the way to bring Jake and Cyrus down, only to find they will end up incriminating themselves in the process. Sally Langston comes to their aid by breaking to the nation, through her televised show, on the existence of top secret organization, B613—a consequence that puts Cyrus and Jake's plans in jeopardy.",1
"ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.",0
"Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian West aren’t so different – both are massive successes in their respective fields (whether it be singing, reality TV and/or accumulating an impressive social media following) and are constantly in the news for, well, anything they do.  But these two have had a rather interesting history, especially after Kim released footage of Taylor and Kanye West‘s phone call about those “Famous” lyrics, as well as Taylor’s supposed rebuttal in the form of her single, “Look What You Made Me Do.” Let’s take a look back on how we got here.  SEPTEMBER 2009: THE KANYE INCIDENT  It’s important that we start here, even though this situation only involved Taylor and Kanye. You see, since Kanye and Kim later married, Kanye’s past becomes important to Kim’s future. And that time he grabbed the mic from Taylor’s hands during her 2009 VMAs acceptance speech is the root of so much more.  A lot was said about this incident over the years from both sides, from apologies to non-apologies, but Kim didn’t have much to say on the matter – yet.  NOVEMBER 2012: JUST CHILLING  At the 2012 MTV EMAs, Taylor hung out with Kim – who had just started dating Kanye a few months before. They also spent time with Rita Ora , who was dating Rob Kardashian at the time. Yes, yes we were ever so young.  There was also a moment when Kim took a photo for Taylor.  FEBRUARY 2015: GOOD VIBES  Taylor and Kanye were reunited at the 2015 Grammys, and there was no drama to be seen. Taylor enjoyed some nice conversation with Kim. Everyone smiled.  They also embraced! This could really be the start of something beautiful.  They also took a group shot with JAY-Z, because, why not?The whole lovefest sparked rumors of a potential collaboration that West was quick to humor in an interview with Ryan Seacrest . “She wants to get in the studio, and we’re definitely going to go in,” he said. “Any artist with an amazing point of view, perspective, fan base, I’m down to get in the studio and work. I don’t discriminate.”  Sadly, that day never came – but if it had, we would have expected backup vocals from Kim, the artist best known for “Jam (Turn It Up).”  FEBRUARY 2015: PARTY TIME  Britt Awards!!! @TaylorSwift @samsmithworld A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Feb 25, 2015 at 5:54pm PST  The two reunited at the 2015 Brit Awards. Kim shared a group photo with Taylor, Kanye and Sam Smith.  They also had a beautiful moment with Karlie Kloss and Derek Blasberg.  Plus, when Kanye performed, Kim was treated to a front-row view of The Taylor Swift Award Show Dancing Extravaganza. Lucky Kim!  via GIPHY  JUNE 2015: SISTERLY BOND  https://www.instagram.com/p/4c9IgIDvAL/  The squad joined forces at Taylor Swift’s 1989 World Tour stop in London, kicking off a summer full of guest appearances up on the stage. One certain member of the squad to note: Kendall Jenner, Kim’s sister.  In fact, a few members of Taylor’s friend circle are also friendly with Kim, including Gigi Hadid and Cara Delevingne (who also go by Slay-Z and Mother Chucker).  AUGUST 2015: BEST NIGHT EVER  Six years after that original night at the VMAs, Taylor took the stage to present Kanye with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. “I have been a fan of his since I can remember because Kanye defines what it is to be a creative force in music, fashion and, well, life,” Taylor said in her introduction. “I’m really happy for you, and I’mma let you finish, but Kanye has had one of the greatest careers of all time!”  She then settled in next to Kim in the audience to watch Kanye give an 11-minute speech/rant/proclamation to run for president. Their expressions throughout it all pretty much confirmed their status as #squad.  They laughed.  They applauded.They looked at one another lovingly.They hugged.And for a brief moment, Tay was basically one of the KarJenners.  https://www.instagram.com/p/7OZIdGDvFT/  After that night, Kanye sent Taylor flowers, which pretty much led to her assertion that she would, indeed, be his running mate. She captioned the Instagram photo, “Awww Kanye sent me the coolest flowers!! #KanTay2020 #BFFs.”  Interestingly enough, these flowers beared a striking resembling to his and Kim’s floral wedding wall.  💍 A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 27, 2014 at 7:58am PDT  This also resembles the flower wall Kanye got Kim for her first Mother’s Day. Basically, if Kanye loves you, you get a flower wall.  #MyWorld A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 11, 2014 at 2:40pm PDT  FEBRUARY 2016: THOSE LYRICS  Then things started to get … complicated. At Kanye’s Yeezy Season 3 fashion show (which doubled as a listening party for his new album, The Life of Pablo), fans first heard his song “Famous.” In it, Kanye raps, “For all my Southside n—-s that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why, I made that bitch famous / Goddamn / I made that bitch famous.”  After some reactions from the Internet (including squad members Gigi Hadid, Karlie Kloss and Jaime King, plus brother Austin Swift), Kanye took to Twitter to clear up his side of the story. According to him, both Taylor and Kim approved the lyrics prior to the song’s debut.  “I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line, and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings,” Kanye wrote. He went on to say his lyrics about Taylor were “endearing” and that she herself was actually the source of a contentious line. According to him, she was at a dinner with one of their mutual friends when she allegedly said, “I can’t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!”  A spokesperson for Taylor told PEOPLE, “Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ‘Famous’ on her Twitter account.”  Her rep also said, “She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, ‘I made that bitch famous.'”  FEBRUARY 2016: TAYLOR’S RESPONSE  The 2016 Grammys came just a few weeks later. Taylor took home the biggest prize of the night – album of the year – and used that moment to make a powerful speech that many saw as a dig to Kanye.  “[A]s the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice,” Taylor said, “I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.”  She continued, “If you just focus on the work, and you don’t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you’re going, you’ll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world. Thank you for this moment.”  JUNE 2016: KIM HAS SOME OPINIONS ON THAT  In her cover interview with GQ for their July issue, Kim said that Taylor did green-light the verse mentioning her. “She totally approved that,” she said. “She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn’t. I swear, my husband gets so much s— for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.”  She continued: “What rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?”  Kim also shared that “so many respected people in the music business” heard the phone conversation and that West always keeps cameras rolling while he is recording an album, in case he decides to make a documentary (as one does).  “I don’t know why she just, you know, flipped all of a sudden,” Kim said. “It was funny because [on the call with Kanye] she said, ‘When I get on the Grammy red carpet, all the media is going to think that I’m so against this, and I’ll just laugh and say, ‘The joke’s on you, guys. I was in on it the whole time.’ And I’m like, wait, but [in] your Grammy speech, you completely dissed my husband just to play the victim again.”  Kim said Kanye and Taylor have not been in touch since the latest bout of drama, but he did receive an attorney’s letter from Taylor’s team asking for the video footage to be destroyed.  JUNE 2016: TAYLOR SEES THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY  GQ reached out for comment from Taylor’s side on the whole debacle. A spokesperson for her declined to directly answer questions seeking clarification on the matter, but instead provided the following statement:  “Taylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian, as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West. However, that does not change the fact that much of what Kim is saying is incorrect. Kanye West and Taylor only spoke once on the phone while she was on vacation with her family in January of 2016, and they have never spoken since. Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do.”  The statement continued: “Kanye West never told Taylor he was going to use the term ‘that bitch’ in referencing her. A song cannot be approved if it was never heard. Kanye West never played the song for Taylor Swift. Taylor heard it for the first time when everyone else did and was humiliated. Kim Kardashian’s claim that Taylor and her team were aware of being recorded is not true, and Taylor cannot understand why Kanye West, and now Kim Kardashian, will not just leave her alone.”  JUNE 2016: THE MUSIC VIDEO  Kanye finally released his NSFW music video for “Famous” – and per usual, it got the people talking.  Inspired by Vincent Desiderio’s 2008 Sleep painting, Kanye literally stripped down 12 of the biggest pop culture figures, including Taylor. The video also opened with a snippet of her and background audio from that fateful night at the MTV Video Music Awards.  JULY 2016: THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY  On an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the family discussed the longstanding feud between Kanye and Taylor in great detail, as well as Kanye’s controversial rant during his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was recorded backstage calling Taylor fake.  When Kanye’s assistant called Kim to let her know about the leaked audio recording from SNL, she got upset, though Kanye didn’t seem too bothered. “My full-time job is your publicist,” she told Kanye. “I care what people think.”  “Kanye says what he wants and he has no filter … and some people may not understand that,” Kim added during her interview. “Usually I try to stay neutral and just give moral support.”  Kim was finally ready to take action when it came to that GQ interview, and she explained to sister Kourtney Kardashian exactly why she felt the need to speak out.  “I never talk s–t about anyone publicly, especially in interviews. But I was just like I had so had it,” she said “I wanted to defend him in it. She legitimately quote says, ‘As soon as I get on that Grammy red carpet I’m gonna tell all the press. Like I was in on it.’ ”  “And then she just didn’t like the reaction?” Kourtney asked.  “Yeah, and you know just another way to play the victim,” Kim added. “It definitely got her a lot of attention the first time,” – referencing when Kanye jumped on VMA stage – “I just don’t think he should be punished for it still to this day,” she continued.  “I feel like I’ve had it with people blatantly treating my husband a certain way and making him look a certain way, and I’m gonna say how I feel,” Kim said during her interview. “Kanye is always so honest and speaks his mind. And you know, when we were first dating, people would always talk s–t and he always had my back. At this point, I really don’t give a f— so I’ll do whatever to protect my husband.”  She then went on to add that Taylor even helped Kanye rewrite the lyrics within the song.  “I’m so glad that you said the truth,” Kourtney told Kim. “Yeah, I’m just speaking the truth,” Kim replied.  At the end of the episode, Kim sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the controversial interview and issues surrounding it. Kris tried to play peacemaker, asking, “What would happen if you just called Taylor up and say ‘What happened? How did this go so south?’ I guess I don’t understand the motivation to flip … maybe she took it the wrong way. My advice would to be give Taylor Swift a call.”  “Thank you for your lovely advice,” Kim told her mother, “but I’m not going to take it.”  JULY 2016: THE VIDEO FOOTAGE  Immediately following that episode of KUWTK, Kim took to Snapchat to provide the proof, sharing a series of videos of that phone call between Kanye and Taylor, discussing the “Famous” lyrics – as well as their history.  “It’s like a compliment,” Taylor is heard saying in the video after Kanye reads the lyrics to her (which include, “For all my Southside n—– that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex”).  “What I give a f— is you as a person, and as a friend, I want things that make you feel good,” Kanye said, and thanked Swift “for being like, so cool about it” after she told him she appreciates the “heads up” on the lyrics.  “I never would’ve expected you to like tell me about a line in your song,” Taylor said. “I mean, I don’t think anybody would listen to that and be like, ‘Oh, that’s a real diss.’ You gotta tell the story that way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it.”  She went on to add, “If people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘He called me and told me before it came out … Joke’s on you, guys. We’re fine.”  Why might Kim do such a thing, you ask? “Kim is super loyal to Kanye and will always do anything to have his back,” a source tells PEOPLE. “She is even more protective of him than she is of herself. She thinks he’s misunderstood and couldn’t stand that people thought he was a liar.”  The Internet immediately seemed to side with Kim, and #KimExposedTaylorParty started trending.  JULY 2016: TAYLOR SPEAKS AGAIN  Taylor wasn’t about to sit back and watch all this happen – she quickly responded to the videos with a post on Instagram.  “Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn’t exist because it never happened. You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” she wrote in a note.  “Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.”  “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009,” Taylor continued. She captioned the post, “That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.”  WATCH: Taylor Swift-Kim Kardashian Feud: Internet Sides with Kim on #KimExposedTaylorParty  JULY 2016: THE AFTERMATH  At this point, the whole situation extends far past Taylor, Kim and Kanye – the whole squad is getting involved.  Taylor’s BFF Selena Gomez tweeted, “There are more important things to talk about Why can’t people use their voice for something that f—— matters? Truth is last thing we need right now is hate, in any form.”  Chloë Grace Moretz spoke out against Kim’s actions, too, which led Kim’s sister Khloé Kardashian to clap back against her.  Then, Ruby Rose, another member of the squad, chimed in with: “Yo Khloe I thought you were rad when I met you but this is awful and this is a 19 year old girl. Nobody likes being bullied or made to feel worthless.. Yet so many people will go above and beyond to make others feel that way.”  Plenty more people weighed in – while some of Kim and Taylor’s friends stayed noticeably quiet.  JULY 2016: WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS…  Aside from the drama with Kimye, Taylor hasn’t had the cleanest breakup from her ex Calvin Harris (considering he recently slammed her on Twitter and all).  The two worlds collided over the weekend during Jennifer Lopez‘s birthday celebration at her show in Las Vegas. French Montana shared an Instagram photo in which a whole group – Harris included – posed with Lopez and a cake.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BIPD1qegmiD/  Kim also shared several Snapchats during her night at Hakkasan nightclub in the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, which included dancing along and lip syncing to songs played at the club – and there’s one song in particular she chose to share with her followers.  Kim shared a video of herself and friend Carla DiBello dancing and singing along to Kanye’s now-infamous song, “Famous,” specifically at the moment where he says, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.”  JULY 2016: SELENA SPEAKS AGAIN  Selena also had a birthday to celebrate over the weekend (which Taylor, of course, observed on Instagram), but it didn’t seem quite as positive. Just before performing her hit single “Kill ‘Em With Kindness” to end a show, Selena got emotional and said to the crowd, “The next song, before I go home, is a song that’s so important to me, because I get really frustrated. I get stupid sometimes. I say things that I don’t mean, or that come out wrong, just because I care so badly.”  Selena talking to the crowd in Jakarta. pic.twitter.com/2mMqbpv1Gp — Diana (: (@gomezmalikteam) July 23, 2016  She continued her message, perhaps alluding to the recent feud Taylor has been dealing with versus Kimye, or the negative reaction from fans when she stepped in to defend her BFF. “But the thing is, at the end of the day, no war in anger was ever won,” she said, quoting her hit song. “I do know that deep down in my heart, that I have to believe that we can love each other and always be kind, no matter what it takes in us. I believe that we can do that, no matter what.”  Things took an even more emotional turn later that night when Selena posted a note on her Instagram reflecting on her performance.  “Tonight I felt extremely unauthentic, unconnected to both myself and my music. I’ve never really felt like my materials, wardrobe or a video could define me. I act on a moment and fear that something hasn’t happened. I’m stagnant, I stay still and don’t just sit with myself first and ask ‘Is this where I am, whole heartedly?’ I’ve always told the truth. I’m always true to my word, I’ve shown who I am but I need to rethink some areas of my life creatively and personally.”  She captioned the screenshot, “not being negative about anything I’ve done. I’m grateful for every single moment I get here – Indonesia you were LOUD and clearly inspiring. Love you so much.”  AUGUST 2017: SENDING A MESSAGE  A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Aug 23, 2017 at 7:01am PDT  Ahead of Taylor releasing her first single since Kim leaked a phone call between the “Shake It Off” singer and Kanye on Snapchat, the reality star banned commenters from using the snake emoji on her Instagram. In the edited clips of the call, the pop star appeared to give the rapper her blessing for his “Famous” lyrics. But on Instagram, Taylor asserted that Kanye never told her he was going to call her “that bitch” in the song. “You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” she wrote. “He promised to play the song for me, but he never did.”  Still, haters flooded Taylor’s social media pages with the reptile last summer. But now she’s embracing the snake image and using it to promote her new music.  AUGUST 2017: A NEW IMAGE  After spending eight months out of the spotlight, Taylor made her triumphant return, announcing that her new album, Reputation, would be dropping in November. While some fans are saying “Look What You Made Me Do” makes digs at Kanye and Kim, we won’t know for sure until the singer comes forward to confirm those rumors.  DECEMBER 2017: IT STILL ISN’T OVER  famous A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Dec 4, 2017 at 3:51pm PST  Kim took to Instagram to share a throwback snapshot of herself at Kanye’s “Famous” exhibit, which shows a nude row of celebs in bed with the rapper — including Taylor. The photo enraged Swifties so much that the superfans flooded the reality star’s account to post rat emojis.",0

"Brad Pitt is reportedly dismissing ex Angelina Jolie’s claim that she’s hurting for money as their bitter divorce battle continues. According to The Blast, Pitt is scoffing at Jolie’s alleged financial woes — because she was just paid more than $20 million for her role in Maleficent 2!  The actors are embroiled in a vicious court feud over their divorce and custody of their six kids. As RadarOnline.com has reported, in the past week, legal papers have shown that Jolie, 43, accused Pitt, 54, of not paying her enough child support over the past two years.  PHOTOS: Somber Brad Pitt Speaks Out After Reaching Custody Agreement With Angelina Jolie  The River Runs Through It star then slammed back, saying he actually gave her a loan of $8 million to buy her L.A. mansion and gave her an additional $1.3 million for their children.  Jolie soon countered, saying that “A loan is not, however, child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate.”  The Tomb Raider actress’ attorney Bley DeJean later said to PEOPLE, “What has been filed by Brad’s side today is a blatant attempt to obfuscate the truth and distract from the fact that he has not fully met his legal obligations to support the children.”  PHOTOS: Angelina Is A ‘Spoiled Brat’ Who Lives In ‘Crazytown!’ Sony Execs Slam Jolie In Newly Leaked Emails — Their Top 13 Disses Exposed  The Blast reported that sources very close to Pitt say that Jolie’s claims that she is hard up for cash and struggling to take care of the children while she has primary custody are “crazy.”  Jolie will star in the upcoming Disney sequel, Maleficent 2, which is scheduled to come out in 2020. The first Maleficent was a huge hit with Jolie playing the powerful fairy queen.  Sources told The Blast however that for ten years, Pitt has been the majority earner of the two.  PHOTOS: Brad Pitt Celebrates Huge Custody Win In Divorce From Angelina Jolie In U.K  But child and spousal support in California are based on current income, and nowadays the two stars aren’t so far apart their monthly earnings, the website has learned.  Jolie is claiming to be a struggling single mom, but Pitt and his legal team beg to differ!  It looks like the divorce fight could go on for quite some time.  We pay for juicy info!

"All the pregnancy accusations are just as bad as fat shaming, FYI.  theres nothing wrong with Rihanna being pregnant, but its kind of rude to assume it bc shes gained some weight. you wouldnt go up to a heavier set woman and ask when shes due bc it’s disrespectful, so why do it to Rih knowing her weight is already an insecurity of hers?  There's obviously nothing wrong with being pregnant, and if Rihanna truly is carrying a baby, then that's great! However, calling a woman pregnant — or assuming she is because of some kooky signs or because she's covering up her stomach — is body shaming.  Also, just because Rihanna wore an outfit that covered her midsection doesn't automatically confirm a pregnancy. No one is entitled to her body, and she can cover it up should she want to.",1
"At home with The Hollywood Reporter, the 'Cake' star gives a very candid interview about everything from being a ""control freak"" to loving 'The Bachelor,' and even her relationships with Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux, as she enters a period of intense midlife contemplation (don't worry, it's not a crisis!): ""I know I have a bigger purpose.""  This story first appeared in the Jan. 30 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.  Just last week, all around Hollywood the words ""Jennifer Aniston"" and ""Oscar nomination"" were being mentioned in the same breath. The Friends star had made a stunning switch to serious drama with Cake, a roughly $7 million indie release that opens Jan. 23; the movie had debuted at the Toronto Film Festival to terrific reviews for the actress, if not for the film itself; she had Harvey Weinstein's former awards consultant, Lisa Taback, on the case; and a nomination looked teed up and ready to go.  Then on Thursday, Jan. 15, at 5:40 a.m., the rug was pulled out from under the movie. Hours after Aniston's triumphant appearance at Cake's Los Angeles premiere, with a nomination from every other major voting body in Hollywood under her belt, a swirl of ""SNUBBED!"" headlines emerged when the best actress nominations were announced and they didn't include the star. After Selma (which landed just two noms, for picture and song), the Aniston rebuke was the dominant entertainment story du jour.  ""I know a lot of people were sorry,"" she says, speaking the day after the nominations. ""I feel I've gotten such wonderful love — I had almost more phone calls and flowers than I did for any other nomination [in the past].""  Whatever pain or anger she may have felt, whatever disappointment or sense of loss (and let's not kid ourselves: Every Oscar snub feels acute to even the strongest person), Aniston never let on. She even joked about it a few days later on Ellen, calling herself ""the number-one snubbed"" (an honor that might perhaps belong to Selma director Ava DuVernay). She was exactly what millions of fans who have known her for two decades wanted her to be: funny and self-deprecating and exquisitely human.  Other actresses might have induced a tsunami of schadenfreude. But Aniston's enduring appeal is rooted in the very fact that she can be hurt, again and again — whether by the Oscars or the Sexiest Man Alive — and she'll endure. She's rich and glamorous and famous, but she's also one of us: a real person with a beating heart.  ***  We sit in Aniston's cavernous Bel Air living room, with the city spreading out through the floor-length windows. It is Jan. 8, a week before the nominations are to be announced, but right now other things are on her mind.  ""I've cried deeply,"" she says. ""I've felt immense loss in my life. Anybody who's felt pain or loss that has sent you to your knees knows [what that's like].""  Her words catch me by surprise. We're halfway through a two-hour interview, and the frothy, fizzy woman I thought I knew so well from Friends has shed her professional shell, revealing a more complex and perhaps vulnerable person inside.  She's just slid off the long, gray sofa where she was sitting in her somewhat minimalist home and now is kneeling on the floor, one arm propped on a coffee table, in jeans and a T-shirt, looking remarkably young and well-toned. Her hair, the most scrutinized in modern media, is of course perfect; her rather artificial tan, less so — but then she's fresh from a photo shoot and hasn't had time to wipe it off.  I hear a hint of regret, though she insists, ""I feel very happy. Life is quite extraordinary."" The words ""pain,"" ""anger"" and ""control"" pop up throughout our conversation — and not just in relation to Cake, a heavy drama in which she plays a woman dealing with debilitating pain following a deadly car crash.  Photos by Ruven Afanador  Cake marks a transition for the star, who's at a point in her life when transitions really matter. It would be wrong to say she's having a midlife crisis; but it might be fair to say she's experiencing a midlife contemplation, when questions about her life, and life itself, are paramount.  At 45 years old, sporting gold-rimmed, aviator-style glasses, Aniston is no longer the ingenue who became a household name at age 25. She has come to terms with a complicated relationship with her mother, has learned to moderate her urge to be always in control and has overcome issues about anger, specifically her longtime history of being ""passive-aggressive.""  Her life is enviable: She's rich enough never to have to work again and has a strong partner in actor-writer Justin Theroux, 43, whom she plans to marry soon. And yet she's still trying to figure out what it all really means, and as time hurtles by, that's growing in importance.  ""Time moves really quickly these days, I don't know why,"" she says poignantly. ""How many times did our parents say, 'Stop wanting everything to rush'? You want summer to be over, you want Christmas to be over, you want this to be over, you want everything to be over just so you can get to the next thing. And boy, you really wish you'd listened to a lot of the things they said.""  She's been through a lot, including her own bout with chronic pain from a pinched nerve in her neck, due to stress, that lasted months and sent her scurrying to specialists. ""I saw this amazing doctor named Alison Tunney who changed my life with this thing called directional nonforce technique,"" she says. ""It's like peeling an onion, like peeling years of injuries.""  She's also had to deal with the premature death of a beloved therapist, a barrage of tabloid stories about her fecundity, or lack thereof; and some withering reviews for movies that may have been beneath her talents (The Bounty Hunter, Horrible Bosses 2).  Not least of her woes is the public's endless obsession with her split from Brad Pitt, even though it's been a decade since their divorce. She's been cast in the role of rejected wife, a Debbie Reynolds for the 2000s, eternally perceived as the victim, even if that's far from how she sees it.  ""We're not in daily communication,"" she says. ""But we wish nothing but wonderful things for each other. Nobody did anything wrong. You know what I mean? It was just like, sometimes things [happen]."" She throws up her hands in exasperation. ""If the world only could just stop with the stupid, soap-opera bullshit. There's no story. I mean, at this point it's starting to become — please, give more credit to these human beings.""  Despite the divorce, she says she has no hesitation about getting married again and sports a huge diamond engagement ring given to her by Theroux, who lives with her in Bel Air, though no date has been set for the wedding. ""We don't have a date,"" she says, then adds slyly, ""I wouldn't tell you if we did.""  As to kids: ""Listen,"" she continues, ""that's a topic that's so exhausted. I get nervous around that, just because it's very personal. Who knows if it's going to happen? It's been a want. We're doing our best.""  ***  Aniston says she's only now learning to deal with anger — discovering how to express it, rather than keeping it bottled up. ""I always thought, if you're angry you just don't say anything,"" she says. ""I would come out passive, things would come out passively. But it doesn't have to be black or white. You don't have to be a hysterical human being and have veins popping out of your neck and turn bright red and terrify people — or else keep quiet and put your head in the sand. I used to loathe confrontation. Loathe it. It was absolute. I understood anger, but I didn't know that you should express it. Which has been something that I've really tried to work on.""  She's also tried to master her need for order. ""I'm a control freak,"" she admits. ""I like to be in charge of everything. My life was so out of control growing up, it's very important today for it to be in control."" Even now, she says, ""I have to bite my tongue sometimes if I'm on a movie, when I think I can figure out how to make this problem that they're having go smoothly. I just bite my tongue, especially with a [bad] director. Some directors are just like — oh, God, oh God, oh God! I [have to] just suffer through this.""  Years of therapy have helped, though it took Aniston a long time to find someone to replace her favorite therapist, who died of a heart attack several years ago.  ""It was at a crazy time, right when we were going through our divorce and everything,"" she recalls. ""But I learned so much in the four years I worked with her, that when she did pass away I remember thinking, 'Wow, everything that we talked about and discussed, it's allowed me to be really peaceful about it all.' I mean, there were human moments. But I was really shockingly OK.""  Everything she did with her therapist, a Jungian who also borrowed from other schools of thought, centered on the fundamental issue of self-assertion, returning Aniston to the theme of anger. ""Her whole thing with me was really saying, 'You have to stand up for yourself in life.' She was really trying to help me deal with anger and learning how to express it without feeling terrified that I was going to get murdered in response.""  Meditation also has helped, she says, and recently she has been meditating a great deal. Mostly she practices at home rather than following any particular guru. ""I'm on a really good personal strict regime,"" she notes. ""These days, I've been [doing it] every day. I have a little place at home, and I do it for about 20 minutes, at different times, usually right after a cup of coffee and before the chaos starts."" She's found inspiration in the Dalai Lama, though they've never met. ""But I'd love to meet him. From the things I've read about him, books and lectures, he seems like pure joy, pure, pure, pure enlightenment.""  If all this might seem a trifle New Age-y, that's not the way Aniston comes across. In fact, she seems as self-aware as she is candid, a rather empathetic person struggling to define her life in the glare of a spotlight few of us will ever face.  She has few heroes she can cite, other than the Dalai Lama. ""They're all dead now,"" she observes wistfully, before citing Laurence Olivier, who died in 1989: ""Honestly, I was obsessed [with him] when I was a kid. I just remember being so enamored of him. I remember thinking, 'Maybe someday, if I become an actress, I'll be able to work with him.' And I remember the day he died, crying my eyes out.""  She seems close to Theroux, who briefly interrupts our interview, dressed in a black leather motorbike jacket, and plants a kiss on her lips. The two met while Aniston was on vacation in Hawaii with her former co-star Courteney Cox and have now been together for four years.  ""It was his humor, mainly"" that drew her to Theroux, she says. ""He's the easiest guy to hang around. He was so completely in his skin. It was the first time I remember being so comfortable [with a romantic interest], like with all my gay friends.""  She remains very friendly with Cox, with whom she just spent Christmas Eve, and she says she just saw another Friends co-star, Lisa Kudrow, the day before our interview.  Other than these actresses' shows, she says, she doesn't watch much television anymore, and the TV she watches is rarely a sitcom. She likes NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams, and favorite programs include 60 Minutes, House of Cards, Breaking Bad and Veep.  ""And then there's junk television,"" she says, smiling, noting she's hooked on The Bachelor. ""I'll say it out loud. Last year, [friends] were saying, 'It's The Bachelor, it's premiering tonight! The Bachelor is premiering tonight!' And I was like, 'Oh, guys! Seriously? The Bachelor? That's been on for 15 years or something.' And Justin and I, just for fun, watched — and two hours later, we were addicted. It was like junk food. We were sad when it ended.""  She has a passion for art, and her living room displays paintings by Marc Chagall, Robert Motherwell and conceptual artist Glenn Ligon, the latter of which she bought at a fundraiser for Haiti organized by friend Ben Stiller. ""I used to have an art studio and paint and work with clay, and I actually miss it,"" she says. ""I was moving storage facilities, and I just found my wheel and my easels and all my books. I found all this stuff, so I may build a little art studio off [the house].""  She doesn't read much, the result of the dyslexia that impacted her education and self-image, which wasn't diagnosed until she was in her early 20s.  ""The only reason I knew [that I had it] was because I went to get a prescription for glasses,"" she recalls. ""I had to wear these Buddy Holly glasses. One had a blue lens and one had a red lens. And I had to read a paragraph, and they gave me a quiz, gave me 10 questions based on what I'd just read, and I think I got three right. Then they put a computer on my eyes, showing where my eyes went when I read. My eyes would jump four words and go back two words, and I also had a little bit of a lazy eye, like a crossed eye, which they always have to correct in photos.""  The revelation that she had dyslexia was life-changing. Until then, ""I thought I wasn't smart. I just couldn't retain anything,"" she says. ""Now I had this great discovery. I felt like all of my childhood trauma-dies, tragedies, dramas were explained.""  ***  She gets up and crosses the room to adjust an ottoman a notch. ""Sorry, I had to move that,"" she says.  Aniston grew up largely in New York, the daughter of two actors. (Her father, John, is a longtime star of Days of Our Lives.) Her life was shaken when her parents split, leaving the 9-year-old girl with her mother, Nancy Dow, while her elder brother, John, moved to Los Angeles.  Now, she says regarding her mother, ""We're all fine,"" but there were years when they didn't speak. ""She had a temper. I can't tolerate that. If I get upset, I will discuss [things]. I will never scream and get hysterical like that. [But] I was never taught that I could scream. One time, I raised my voice to my mother, and I screamed at her, and she looked at me and burst out laughing. She was laughing at me [for] screaming back. And it was like a punch in my stomach.""  She pauses, and then adds: ""She was critical. She was very critical of me. Because she was a model, she was gorgeous, stunning. I wasn't. I never was. I honestly still don't think of myself in that sort of light, which is fine. She was also very unforgiving. She would hold grudges that I just found so petty.""  Aniston herself claims to hold no grudges and is forgiving ""probably to a fault. There are people in my life that are like, 'How do you even talk to that guy?' But what's the point of holding on to [anger]? That's so toxic. We're human beings. Human beings make mistakes. Human beings are not perfect. And by not forgiving someone, it's not allowing human beings to evolve and become better people.""  In her early years, she turned for support to her father's mother, Stella. ""She was a Greek grandmother who just loved me more than anything and was so fun to be around,"" she says. ""She had the best stories, she made me laugh. Beautiful, funny, gorgeous, hysterical — all the Greeks, all of my Greek family, were."" She spent a year visiting them as a small child, in Athens and Crete, and her grandmother's death remains one of the most traumatic moments in her life. ""I was around 21 years old, and it was the first time I'd had a loss. It was really sad. But then, like anything, you have to move on.""  While she grew up Greek Orthodox and was ""dunked in St. Sophia's,"" she says she has no strict religion: ""I grew up really seeing a lot of negativity around religion. I actually had quite a beautiful upbringing with it, because it was never pounded down my throat, and I had the joy of going to church and experiencing ceremony and ritual and incense, and I thought it was quite beautiful. But other kids who were from Catholic families, or really strict Christian families — there was this 'You're going to hell' sort of thing.""  She wasn't a good student, she says, in large part because of the dyslexia. Though that didn't improve her self-image, it did push her to develop her innate humor. She was funny at school, and people liked it. Her only passions there were an art class and a workshop where she tried out watercolor and charcoal and could carve creatures such as the wooden lions she still keeps — and, of course, drama.  After acting at school, she got her first work off-Broadway in 1988, when she was still in her late teens. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles and in her mid-20s landed Friends. ""They wanted me to audition for [the part of] Monica, and I read the script and I didn't want to do the Monica role,"" she says. ""I wanted to do Rachel.""  The role made her insanely rich and famous, and in its later years Aniston was paid an astronomical $1 million per episode. But all this is over now, part of another life long gone, and there are no plans for a reunion (though the residuals continue to roll in).  ""That's completely past,"" she says, with just a hint of nostalgia.  ***  Cake, for which Aniston received Golden Globe and SAG nominations, put an exclamation point on the present.  It was a commitment not just to a role but to work itself, showing that even this woman who has so much still seeks something more than money and fame.  ""As an accident victim whose nearly every move is excruciating,"" wrote Sheri Linden in the Los Angeles Times, ""Aniston lends the role an impressively agonized physicality and brings ace timing to the screenplay's welcome gallows humor.""  Until the script came along, the actress had been planning to take it easy. ""I'd been working for the past couple years,"" she says, ""and I was actually thinking: This year would be a nice year to take a break and maybe travel, or do something more on the producorial side, maybe even direct another series of short films."" (She directed an episode of Lifetime's 2011 anthology Five.)  But then she fell in love with the material, which came to her through her managers, Aleen Keshishian and Zack Morgenroth. (She's also repped by CAA's Kevin Huvane.) To her surprise, the usual suspects of A-list drama stars turned it down, and now Aniston felt she had a chance. She auditioned for director Daniel Barnz, then urged him to give her the role, telling him she would ""go to the moon"" for him.  Deep in her heart, she was convinced she could pull it off. But she also knew there would be many naysayers, and some of their negativity rubbed off. ""I've been told so many times 'You're not that type' that part of me went, 'Am I not? Can I really [do this]?' So it was like, 'I'm going to prove it to myself.' There was a confidence in knowing that I'm capable of doing this after so many years of being able to 'show up.' This was the first time I had so many layers to explore. I took out a tool bag I hadn't used.""  Barnz, who wrote Aniston an encouraging letter before they met, says he embraced her roots in comedy. ""When I first heard that Jen was interested, I immediately thought of one of my favorite movies, Ordinary People, which featured a [dramatic] performance by an actress primarily known for comedy, Mary Tyler Moore,"" he says. ""I really wanted to find an actress who could bring out all of the warmth and humor of this woman.""  Aniston spoke to friends who had dealt with pain — and even a therapist who specializes in it, who told her that ""people who use drugs with chronic pain, even if the pain has gone, the memory still holds on to it and doesn't want to let go [of the solace from painkillers].""  The 25-day shoot in and around Los Angeles wasn't easy, though Barnz and Aniston spent two months in intense conversations about the role before filming began. Aniston drew on her own memories of anguish. The emotions flooded out of her in a way she had never permitted onscreen.  At one point, she was paralyzed by fear. In a sequence where she submerges herself in a pool in an attempt to see what it would be like to commit suicide, a water phobia she has had all her life proved overpowering. ""I have a terror of water,"" she confesses. ""It took forever. I kept going in, and I'd have the weirdest Pavlovian thing, and I'd turn around and go right back up. I was starting to cry. I was really having a lot of anxiety. I'm like, 'Don't cry! Don't cry! Don't cry!' And the underwater camera guy came over and said, 'Don't do this. Don't do this anymore.' ""  During another scene, when the man responsible for the car accident that has left her in so much pain (played by William H. Macy) arrives at her door, Aniston was overwhelmed. ""Seeing the face of that man, I just wanted to beat the shit out of him,"" she says. ""Thankfully, they gave me a stuntman to beat up, because I would have killed Bill. Really. This big guy said, 'You can punch me as hard as you possibly can.' And I remember seeing white and just beating him for take after take. And the next day, I woke up and couldn't move. My body seized [up]. I was like, 'What the f— did I do?' ""  ***  What lies next is unclear. ""In terms of my career, that's the thing I've always let come to me,"" she says. ""I've never been strategic. I don't have an agenda. I just go with my gut.""  She says she's open to doing theater and even returning to series TV. She also would like to direct a film but hasn't encountered the right vehicle. ""I was trying to find a full-length feature, and that almost happened two years ago, and then an acting job arrived, so I couldn't do it,"" she says. ""But I have to get that super-excited feeling, and I really promised myself that, unless I feel with all my heart, 'Oh, I have to do this,' then I just can't. There's too much to be home for.""  Home, now, is the epicenter of her existence. In some ways, she's a homebody who gets great joy from restoring houses, just as she has fixed up the house where we sit this late afternoon. That has much more appeal than uprooting herself for the sake of just another job. ""When you're younger and you're off for three months, four months, doing a movie God-knows-where, it's fine and it's a fun experience,"" she says. ""But when you get to a place where you want to be home, and you have a partner, you have to be selective.""  She pauses to contemplate what she's just said. One of her three rescue dogs, an old white shepherd, lopes in and comes up to her, licking her face. She shows him a warmth she rarely reveals to strangers.  The light is fading. The view from the windows is dark now. One of the two great doors that lead into Aniston's fortress-like house opens, and her manager, Keshishian, enters with a colleague. It occurs to me that Aniston resembles this house, so protected on the outside, but with great vistas spreading out once one gets within.  Her life is full to overflowing, but she's still searching for the great big thing that will give it meaning as she enters its next phase. Perhaps it's a role, perhaps something that has nothing to do with her craft.  ""There's something bigger I'm interested in doing,"" she says. ""It could be more work, it could be more creativity, or getting more philanthropic in the world. It can look like a baby. It can look like a foundation. I know I have a bigger purpose. It's a puzzle, and I haven't quite put the puzzle together. But something greater is calling out to me.""",0

"The fate of the upcoming Han Solo spin-off film is currently unknown, as a surprise announcement came late on Tuesday that revealed directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were leaving the film with three weeks left of filming. Although their successor has yet to be named, Star Wars fanboy and filmmaker Kyle Newman threw his hat into the ring and even offered to take a massive pay cut to bring the film to completion.  When people began suggesting he take over the reins on Twitter, Newman replied with a string of replies to various different accounts. His message on the matter is as follows:  ""I'm available. To be honest, I'd kill it. Was born for it. And know Solo inside out. And am free. As in I would cost zero dollars. I'm not shiny and new. But goddamn could I direct the f**k out of some Star Wars. I have my doctorate in it after all. No fear. Only adrenaline. If it's Star Wars, then I'm your guy. Period. I know Solo inside and out. You'd enjoy my Han Solo radio dramas recorded live at the past three domestic SW Celebrations. I truly feel like I'm wasting my life NOT working on Star Wars in some capacity. I would go supernova and blow people's minds."" The filmmaker then noted, ""It could be a great film and will be a great film."" He also made sure to commend Lord and Miller, saying, ""Those guys are great and their DNA will still be all over it.""  UP NEXT: More Possible Han Solo Replacement Directors Named Not wanting to hog all the attention himself, Newman also suggested that Dave Filoni, director of the Clone Wars animated series and executive producer of Star Wars Rebels, could finish the production.  A huge force in the fan community, Newman has made multiple projects that honor the saga, from the Fanboys film starring Kristen Bell and Dan Fogler about fans trying to break into Lucasfilm to see Phantom Menace before it was released to a variety of live stage shows at conventions and documentaries. MORE NEWS: Han Solo Directors Reportedly Fired After Clashing With Kathleen Kennedy ""Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are talented filmmakers who have assembled an incredible cast and crew, but it’s become clear that we had different creative visions on this film, and we’ve decided to part ways. A new director will be announced soon,"" Kathleen Kennedy said in a statement.  Lord and Miller also released a statement, saying, ""Unfortunately, our vision and process weren’t aligned with our partners on this project. We normally aren’t fans of the phrase ‘creative differences’ but for once this cliché is true. We are really proud of the amazing and world-class work of our cast and crew."" The untitled Han Solo movie will be in theaters May 25, 2018.  Alden Ehrenreich stars as a young Han Solo and Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca in the era before Star Wars: A New Hope, before they met Leia and Luke and embarked on a galaxy-saving adventure.

"Jillian Michaels Claims Yacht Crew Tried to Extort Her She had an ‘aggressive and threatening’ exchange while vacationing in Italy.  While vacationing in Italy, Jillian Michaels claims a yacht crew member tried to extort her through an “aggressive and threatening” exchange.  The fitness star opened up on Facebook saying she had chartered a boat for 12 days for $60k, but when she arrived on Tuesday, the boat was rusted and damaged.  The 43-year-old trainer said the crew demanded extra money for fuel because the “gas cash had been drained by mobsters in Capri,” writes the Daily Mail.  In a video sent to the Daily Mail, Michaels is seen arguing with a crew member and is insisting the interaction be filmed. She claims she is being scammed and held hostage.  Michaels found the boat through an online company and was traveling with friends, family members and her daughter.  She told the Daily Mail in an email that she and the group are “doing okay” and she is “truly unclear of how far these individuals will go as I was physically intimidated and threatened in emails.”  She warns others to investigate as much as possible beforehand and if anything happens, contact the U.S. Embassy American Citizen Services.

The 20-year-old, who shares baby Stormi with boyfriend Travis Scott , proved once and for all that she's still got it as she posed up in nothing but a white swimsuit.  In a pair of pictures she posted on Instagram, Kylie, who recently ditched her lip fillers, gives the camera a sultry gaze as she shows off her curves.  ""Good morning,"" the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star captioned the sexy snaps, and her fans couldn't get enough.  (Image: Splash News)  In the first picture, lip kit mogul Kylie lies on her side in the white swimsuit, which features mesh detailing on the body and mesh sleeves.  She clasps her hands together, revealing a neutral shade on her famous talons, as she stares into the lens.  Her lips are noticeably smaller after she got rid of her fillers and her brunette locks flop over onto the bed with her nude lips and brown eyeshadow giving her a much more natural look.  In the second snap, Kylie lies on her back with her eyes closed and her hands placed on top of her head.  ""In love w/ you,"" one fan commented.

And another said: ""what a babe!! Loving this look""  It comes after fans came up with some bizarre theories about why she decided to stop getting lip injections to plump up her pout.  Some fans have a wild theory that she's got rid of her fillers and stopped using fake tan in order to look more 'Asian'.  And some trolls think it's because there was some overlap in her relationship with Tyga, who is of Vietnamese descent, and her current boyfriend Travis.  They think that Kylie is trying to make herself look more like Stormi in a bid to stop people questioning who her father is.

"Mila Kunis has no problem blocking out the tabloid noise that gets written about her and her family.  “I don’t read anything about myself,” Kunis told Cosmopolitan. “I genuinely don’t know what’s written about me … other than I know that I’m pregnant about once a year and my husband and I are getting a divorce once a year. I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, Oh boy, OK!”  Her relatives, however, can’t shake it all off quite as easily as “The Spy Who Dumped Me” star because they’ve often thought some headlines were true.  “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she shared. “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover.  “The amount of stress that caused my family,” she said, “nobody will understand.”  On a lighter note, Kunis, who is a mom to 3-year-old daughter Wyatt and 1-year-old son Dimitri with husband Ashton Kutcher, revealed that her dad always hopes the pregnancy headlines are true.  “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”",0

"Jacques Berman Webster II[3] (born April 30, 1992),[4] known professionally as Travis Scott (formerly stylized as Travi$ Scott), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. In 2012, Scott signed his first major-label deal with Epic Records. In November of the same year, Scott signed a deal with Kanye West's GOOD Music, as part of its production wing Very GOOD Beats, after appearing on the label's 2012 compilation album Cruel Summer. In April 2013, Scott signed a record deal with T.I.'s Grand Hustle imprint.  Scott's first full-length project, a mixtape titled Owl Pharaoh, was self-released in May 2013. This was followed with a second mixtape, titled Days Before Rodeo, in August 2014.

The single, which also features vocals from Quavo of Atlanta-based rap trio Migos, reached number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

"The pair were constantly bickering on Twitter  Katy Perry has finally buried the hatchet with Calvin Harris after they fell out six years ago.  The pair fell out in 2011 when Harris was booked as the opening act for the singer’s tour but he pulled out at the last minute over issues with set production.  At the time Perry wrote: ”Calvin Harris will NOT be joining in on the fun and has CANCELLED last minute,” while Calvin hit back saying: ”Sorry to all who wanted to see me with Katy – her team suddenly moved the goalposts and I was to appear on stage with no production.”  However, Perry hit back, saying: ”The goalpost seems to be perfectly fine for New Young Pony Club, Yelle, Robyn, Marina & The Diamonds, to name a few. It’s fine, I’m used to you cancelling on me, it’s become ur staple! (sic).”  And Harris also dragged her into his public feud with Taylor Swift, after she started dating Tom Hiddleston and it was revealed that she had written the lyrics for his Rihanna collaboration ‘This Is What You Came For’.  He wrote at the time: ”I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do.  ”I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it (sic).”  Perry said they hadn’t spoken since but has now revealed when they met at the Vanity Fair Oscars party this year, they decided to forget about the past and Harris asked her to collaborate on new song ‘Feels’, which appeared on his recent album ‘Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1’.  She told ‘On Air With Ryan Seacrest’, Katy said: ”We’d had little falling outs here and there. We’d had some public Twitter spats … Time to put all that behind us.  ”We just bumped into each other and he said, ‘I think I have a song that you should come check out’. I was like ‘cool’ because we had always meant to work together for years and years and years. I came to the studio and he played me a bunch of unfinished but really solid moments for his new record.  ”Then he played me this one part for this new song called ‘Feels’ and I was like, ‘Oh yeah’. This is like my favourite song off the record. I was just down to do it. I’ve always wanted to collaborate with him for years and years and years.”  Meanwhile, Perry recently revealed that she has delayed the start of her ‘Witness‘ world tour.",0

"This show is fantastic. I don't have cable, so I didn't actually know about it until I randomly saw Elizabeth Hurley on a talk show promoting it. I immediately watched S1 on Prime, and coughed up the $20 to buy S2. Some things that should be noted if you are trying to decide whether or not to watch, consider this:    1) Don't listen to the low reviewers who are giving it 1-3 Stars because it's not ""true to the UK"". Of *COURSE* it's not ""true to the UK. This show is on E!, not BBC or PBS. People watch this show to be entertained, not to learn how the monarchy really works.    2) The fun thing about this show is that it's all made up. It isn't true life or how the real ""royals"" really are. It's actually a lot more sensationalized and more fun. There's mystery, love, murder, scandal, intrigue - you won't find any tea parties here. What's even better about this is that it's a non-reality show that doesn't involve medical stuff, police, or firefighters. (Don't get me wrong, I absolutely appreciate what all first-responders do, but I'm not interested enough to watch shows about them). The aspect of the royal family and all their made-up scandals makes it fun to watch.    3) The soundtrack to this show is AWESOME! I've come across some cool new artists that I wouldn't have otherwise known about had it not been for this show. After every episode, I find myself Googling who the musical artists were so I can download more of their songs.    Things about this show that I'm not a fan of:  1) The whole ""will they, or won't they"" with the Liam / Ophelia pairing. Ophelia is just boring. Sure, she's pretty, but there's nothing interesting about her character at all. The whole ""common girl becomes a princess"" storyline has been overdone SO MANY TIMES and is so predictable. Unfortunately, I don't think her character will be going away any time soon, considering the happenings in the S2 finale. That's too bad. In S1, I was really rooting for Gemma, but now that the actress who plays her has left the show (which is unfortunate, she did an amazing job as Gemma), I've been hoping Wilhelmina wins the heart of Liam. Wilhelmina has spunk and actual personality.    2) There are only 10 episodes per season. That makes me so sad :(",0

"A CONTROVERSIAL reality TV star has courted controversy after admitting that she used drugs while pregnant with her daughter less than a year after admitting she nearly died of a heroin overdose.  Jenelle Evans’ past has been notoriously sketchy but the MTV Teen Mom 2 star says that despite the fact she has gotten her life back on track and that she’s “not a bad kid any more”, online speculation over her parenting methods is forcing Child Protection Services on her.  It comes after fans accused the star of child abuse after her son, Kaiser, begged for food on the TV show. The shocking footage sparked a Twitter backlash with the hashtag #SaveKaiser and cost the mother-of-three her job as an ambassador with Blue Apron.  In her memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, Ms Evans admitted that at the peak of her drug addiction she was using heroin “four or five times a day”.  “I was hooked,” she said of her abusive relationship, which saw her arrested for possession of marijuana and heroin, according to Radar.  This week, Ms Evans appeared on The Brand podcast and admitted that while she was pregnant with daughter Ensley, she tested positive for THC, the principal psychoactive found in cannabis.  “I’m not going to lie about that. I tested positive for THC,” the reality star, 26, said.  Daughter Ensley did not test positive.  Ms Evans said the chemical compound was found shortly after she had given birth to her daughter just over one year ago after Child Protective Services asked her if she had smoked during her pregnancy.  “I said, ‘I did within the past 30 days,’” she explained.  “I said, ‘I have really bad esophageal spasms and I throw up every five minutes. I can’t eat.’ And they said, ‘OK, some mums do that. We are not here to judge. We are writing down your information.’”  She said that when Child Protective Services arrived for the wellness check, they closed the case soon after.  But then Ms Evans blamed online speculation over her parenting for at least 30 more visits from Child Protection, calling out “haters online saying that I abuse my kids”.  Despite promising she’s not using, viewers on the hit reality show, on which Ms Evans has appeared since 2011, aren’t so sure.  All jokes aside, someone should go to the land and make sure that those kids (more so Kaiser) are in a safe situation. They do not deserve to be witnessing what’s more than likely going on in their home.. #SaveKaiser #TeenMom2 #TeenMomOG #JenelleEvans #DavidEason — leeeasha (@leashaboo89) February 21, 2018  “First of all, if I were on drugs I wouldn’t be able to sit here in the morning and get the kids ready and eat healthily. Or I’d be losing a lot of weight,” Ms Evans said.  But the young mum, who already has two children, sons Jace, 8, and Kaiser, 3 has a sketchy history with drug abuse, including a near-fatal heroin overdose in 2012.  “I was afraid to speak out and tell people that I was on drugs,” she told Us Weekly last year,  “I basically blacked out and woke up not remembering anything.  “I really was so close to dying.”  After her overdose Ms Evans described how she withdrew from the drug, describing it as “worst flu I’ve ever had for seven days”.  But by that stage the drug had already taken its toll; she had lost custody of son Jace and was “disowned” by family and friends.  “It hurt my heart, made me sick to my soul that I couldn’t see my son. I filled that hateful void with more drugs,” she wrote in her memoir.  “The drugs always made the pain go away. They didn’t turn on me or betray me. I guess heroin was my first steady, dependable lover. It gave me what I needed to live and I gave it my life. By this entry, heroin was the only thing I had in my life that loved me.”  According to Kidspot, a report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed that the rate of pregnant women using marijuana has increased 62 per cent  Marijuana is the “most widely used illicit drug among all pregnant women”, the website claims, and said there is “some cause for concern” of the effects of marijuana on a foetus.  “Infants of women who used marijuana during pregnancy were more likely to be anaemic, have lower birth weight, and require placement in neonatal intensive care than infants of mothers who did not use marijuana,” Dr Nora Volkow wrote in a paper, The Risks of Marijuana Use During Pregnancy, for the JAMA Network.  — Continue the conversation with Matt Young on Facebook or Twitter.",0
"Jennifer Lopez is “having the best time” with Alex Rodriguez — but she’s being careful not to repeat past “mistakes.”  The pop star said in a recent interview with Good Morning America that despite the lyrical content of her latest song — “El Anillo,” which is Spanish for “The Ring” — she and her beau are just enjoying their relationship and in no rush to walk down the aisle.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “We have to take our time,” she explained. “I’ve made plenty of mistakes in my past. We’re mature now. We’re grown-ups, and we’re going to take our time and we’re going to do things at our own pace.”  The 48-year-old continued, “Our life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work, we’re truly blessed. We don’t need anything more right now.”  Lopez has been married three times — to waiter Ojani Noa (1997 to 1998), dancer Cris Judd (2001 to 2002) and Marc Anthony (2004 to 2014), with whom she shares 10-year-old twins Emme and Max. In 2002, the singer was also engaged to Ben Affleck. Meanwhile, Rodriguez shares daughters Ella, 10, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.  RELATED: Everything We Know About Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez’s Romance — So Far  As for “El Anillo”? It was “written about the two of us, but it’s like, not about the two of us,” Lopez explained.  “It’s not like I’m like, ‘Hey …. Where’s my ring?'” she said. “No, it’s not like that.”  The Shades of Blue star added, “I feel like they wrote it because … they want that to happen.”  Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez Mark Sagliocco/Getty  During a recent sit-down on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Lopez revealed what it would take to break up with the former baseball star.  “I’m so competitive [in] every way. I don’t know, it’s just something inside me, I’m competitive,” she explained. “When we work out I think, ‘I can beat you.’ I’m not laughing.”  However, Lopez said that her 42-year-old beau “doesn’t even entertain my delusions” — and that’s probably for the best.  “There’s no winning that because if he beats me, it’s over!” she joked.  Instead of battling, the couple are extremely supportive of each other. Lopez shared that Rodriguez attends her shows in Las Vegas and she’ll go to baseball games that he’s commentating on, even wearing an earpiece so she can listen to him.

I was quickly scrolling down the script, and I can’t really tell you what I was looking for.

So I’m not going to not say that it’s not there, because it is,” she added. “After being told to see things a certain way for decades, you realize, ‘Oh my god!

That you don’t have opportunity. It’s all how you see the opportunity. And the clearer and deeper you get into what you really want, you just become a better artist. If that’s what you really want — becoming a better artist — does that include access? Does that include having 5 billion Instagram followers? I don’t know. That’s for you to decide,” she told Vulture.  She continued: “But if what you want is to connect, if what you want is to be a great artist, I think you can find your way.

"Rose McGowan has spoken out again on Anthony Bourdain‘s death, claiming that the late chef and his girlfriend Asia Argento had a “free relationship.”  “Dear Fellow Humans,” she wrote in an open letter. “Sitting across from me is the remarkable human and brave survivor, Asia Argento, who has been through more than most could stand, and yet stand she does.

I know so many around the world thought of Anthony Bourdain as a friend and when a friend dies, it hurts. Many of these people who lost their ‘friend’ are wanting to lash out and blame. You must not sink to that level. Suicide is a horrible choice, but it is that person’s choice,” she added.  Anthony Bourdain and Asia Argento John Nacion/Startraks  RELATED: Rose McGowan Mourns the Loss of Friend Anthony Bourdain in Teary Video: ‘I’m So Mad at You’  Bourdain began dating the Italian actress in 2017, after she appeared on an episode of Parts Unknown filmed in her hometown of Rome. She recently directed an upcoming episode set in Hong Kong, and Bourdain would often consult her for her rich knowledge of music and film when putting together the series.  Argento was one of the dozens of women to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment in 2017 (Weinstein has “unequivocally” denied “any allegations of non-consensual sex”). Bourdain became one of the most outspoken celebrities about the #MeToo era, showing unwavering support for his girlfriend, and even holding a dinner for Argento and fellow Weinstein accusers McGowan and Annabella Sciorra.  Addressing the late chef’s depression, McGowan continued, “Anthony was open with his demons, he even wrote a book about them. In the beginning of their relationship, Anthony told a mutual friend, ‘He’s never met anyone who wanted to die more than him.’ And through a lot of this last year, Asia did want the pain to stop.”  “But here’s the thing, over their time together, thankfully, she did the work to get help, so she could stay alive and live another day for her and her children. Anthony’s depression didn’t let him, he put down his armor, and that was very much his choice. His decision, not hers. His depression won,” she remarked.

They laughed, they loved and he was her rock during the hardships of this last year.”  Continuing, she wrote that the pair “loved without borders of traditional relationships, and they established the parameters of their relationship early on. Asia is a free bird, and so was Anthony. Was. Such a terrible word to write. I’ve heard from many that the past two years they were together were some of his happiest and that should give us all solace.”  While Bourdain was shooting for Parts Unknown in France before his death, Argento was spotted holding hands with another man in Rome, according to TMZ.

My father also suffered from intermittent deep depression, and like Anthony, was part of a ‘pull up your bootstraps and march on’ generation. The a ‘strong man doesn’t ask for help’ generation,” she wrote, adding that although Bourdain did reach out for help before taking his life, “he did not take the doctor’s advice.”  She also asked fans of the late chef and TV host to “NOT do the sexist thing and burn a woman on the pyre of misplaced blame.”  “Anthony’s internal war was his war, but now she’s been left on the battlefield to take the bullets. It is in no way fair or acceptable to blame her or anyone else, not even Anthony. We are asking you to be better, to look deeper, to read and learn about mental illness, suicide and depression before you make it worse for survivors by judging that which we do not understand, that which can never fully be understood.

There is no one to blame but the stigma of loneliness, the stigma of asking for help, the stigma of mental illness, the stigma of being famous and hurting,” she continued.  She also added that “Anthony would never have wanted Asia to be hurt,” before urging anyone who might be considering suicide to seek help. “We need you here. You matter. You exist. You count.

"SONGBIRD turned fashion mogul Jessica Simpson is bursting at the seams, looking anything but pulled together lately. But it’s not her shocking 40-pound weight gain or sloppy attire that has loved ones worried. Rather, it’s her wine-swilling, bingeand-purge lifestyle that’s endangering her health and could ultimately cause her children to be taken from her.  “Poor Jess really seems to be losing it,” confides a friend. “Lately, she’s been looking trashed, slurring her words, not making sense — no wonder people think she’s drunk, on drugs or both. There’s real concern that she’s on her way to a serious health problem, possibly even an overdose, if she continues down this path.”  ABUSING HER BODY  After a boozy coast-to-coast flight on Aug. 10, Jessica, 37, was spotted spilling out of LAX airport, barely able to walk. The bloated, double-chinned mother of two was wobbly as she made her way to a waiting car and nearly passed out as soon as she got inside.  “It’s no secret that Jessica likes her wine, but the more you drink, the more you eat, which is no doubt why she’s packed on the pounds,” says the friend. “For years, she would binge and then abstain, which allowed her to keep her figure. She’s not a kid anymore, though, and those ‘tricks’ won’t work.”  Health experts concur. “It&rs",1
"One Monday morning last September, Britain woke to a depraved news story. The prime minister, David Cameron, had committed an “obscene act with a dead pig’s head”, according to the Daily Mail. “A distinguished Oxford contemporary claims Cameron once took part in an outrageous initiation ceremony at a Piers Gaveston event, involving a dead pig,” the paper reported. Piers Gaveston is the name of a riotous Oxford university dining society; the authors of the story claimed their source was an MP, who said he had seen photographic evidence: “His extraordinary suggestion is that the future PM inserted a private part of his anatomy into the animal.”  The story, extracted from a new biography of Cameron, sparked an immediate furore. It was gross, it was a great opportunity to humiliate an elitist prime minister, and many felt it rang true for a former member of the notorious Bullingdon Club. Within minutes, #Piggate and #Hameron were trending on Twitter, and even senior politicians joined the fun: Nicola Sturgeon said the allegations had “entertained the whole country”, while Paddy Ashdown joked that Cameron was “hogging the headlines”. At first, the BBC refused to mention the allegations, and 10 Downing Street said it would not “dignify” the story with a response – but soon it was forced to issue a denial. And so a powerful man was sexually shamed, in a way that had nothing to do with his divisive politics, and in a way he could never really respond to. But who cares? He could take it.  Then, after a full day of online merriment, something shocking happened. Isabel Oakeshott, the Daily Mail journalist who had co-written the biography with Lord Ashcroft, a billionaire businessman, went on TV and admitted that she did not know whether her huge, scandalous scoop was even true. Pressed to provide evidence for the sensational claim, Oakeshott admitted she had none.  “We couldn’t get to the bottom of that source’s allegations,” she said on Channel 4 News. “So we merely reported the account that the source gave us … We don’t say whether we believe it to be true.” In other words, there was no evidence that the prime minister of the United Kingdom had once “inserted a private part of his anatomy” into the mouth of a dead pig – a story reported in dozens of newspapers and repeated in millions of tweets and Facebook updates, which many people presumably still believe to be true today.  Oakeshott went even further to absolve herself of any journalistic responsibility: “It’s up to other people to decide whether they give it any credibility or not,” she concluded. This was not, of course, the first time that outlandish claims were published on the basis of flimsy evidence, but this was an unusually brazen defence. It seemed that journalists were no longer required to believe their own stories to be true, nor, apparently, did they need to provide evidence. Instead it was up to the reader – who does not even know the identity of the source – to make up their own mind. But based on what? Gut instinct, intuition, mood?  How technology disrupted the truth – podcast Read more  Does the truth matter any more?  Nine months after Britain woke up giggling at Cameron’s hypothetical porcine intimacies, the country arose on the morning of 24 June to the very real sight of the prime minister standing outside Downing Street at 8am, announcing his own resignation.  “The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected,” Cameron declared. “It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organisations about the significance of this decision. So there can be no doubt about the result.”  But what soon became clear was that almost everything was still in doubt. At the end of a campaign that dominated the news for months, it was suddenly obvious that the winning side had no plan for how or when the UK would leave the EU – while the deceptive claims that carried the leave campaign to victory suddenly crumbled. At 6.31am on Friday 24 June, just over an hour after the result of the EU referendum had become clear, Ukip leader Nigel Farage conceded that a post-Brexit UK would not in fact have £350m a week spare to spend on the NHS – a key claim of Brexiteers that was even emblazoned on the Vote Leave campaign bus. A few hours later, the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan stated that immigration was not likely to be reduced – another key claim.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA  It was hardly the first time that politicians had failed to deliver what they promised, but it might have been the first time they admitted on the morning after victory that the promises had been false all along. This was the first major vote in the era of post-truth politics: the listless remain campaign attempted to fight fantasy with facts, but quickly found that the currency of fact had been badly debased.  The remain side’s worrying facts and worried experts were dismissed as “Project Fear” – and quickly neutralised by opposing “facts”: if 99 experts said the economy would crash and one disagreed, the BBC told us that each side had a different view of the situation. (This is a disastrous mistake that ends up obscuring truth, and echoes how some report climate change.) Michael Gove declared that “people in this country have had enough of experts” on Sky News. He also compared 10 Nobel prize-winning economists who signed an anti-Brexit letter to Nazi scientists loyal to Hitler.  It can become very difficult for anyone to tell the difference between facts that are true and 'facts' that are not  For months, the Eurosceptic press trumpeted every dubious claim and rubbished every expert warning, filling the front pages with too many confected anti-migrant headlines to count – many of them later quietly corrected in very small print. A week before the vote – on the same day Nigel Farage unveiled his inflammatory “Breaking Point” poster, and the Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned tirelessly for refugees, was shot dead – the cover of the Daily Mail featured a picture of migrants in the back of a lorry entering the UK, with the headline “We are from Europe – let us in!” The next day, the Mail and the Sun, which also carried the story, were forced to admit that the stowaways were actually from Iraq and Kuwait.  The brazen disregard for facts did not stop after the referendum: just this weekend, the short-lived Conservative leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom, fresh from a starring role in the leave campaign, demonstrated the waning power of evidence. After telling the Times that being a mother would make her a better PM than her rival Theresa May, she cried “gutter journalism!” and accused the newspaper of misrepresenting her remarks – even though she said exactly that, clearly and definitively and on tape. Leadsom is a post-truth politician even about her own truths.  When a fact begins to resemble whatever you feel is true, it becomes very difficult for anyone to tell the difference between facts that are true and “facts” that are not. The leave campaign was well aware of this – and took full advantage, safe in the knowledge that the Advertising Standards Authority has no power to police political claims. A few days after the vote, Arron Banks, Ukip’s largest donor and the main funder of the Leave.EU campaign, told the Guardian that his side knew all along that facts would not win the day. “It was taking an American-style media approach,” said Banks. “What they said early on was ‘Facts don’t work’, and that’s it. The remain campaign featured fact, fact, fact, fact, fact. It just doesn’t work. You have got to connect with people emotionally. It’s the Trump success.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Sébastien Thibault  It was little surprise that some people were shocked after the result to discover that Brexit might have serious consequences and few of the promised benefits. When “facts don’t work” and voters don’t trust the media, everyone believes in their own “truth” – and the results, as we have just seen, can be devastating.  How did we end up here? And how do we fix it?  Twenty-five years after the first website went online, it is clear that we are living through a period of dizzying transition. For 500 years after Gutenberg, the dominant form of information was the printed page: knowledge was primarily delivered in a fixed format, one that encouraged readers to believe in stable and settled truths.  Now, we are caught in a series of confusing battles between opposing forces: between truth and falsehood, fact and rumour, kindness and cruelty; between the few and the many, the connected and the alienated; between the open platform of the web as its architects envisioned it and the gated enclosures of Facebook and other social networks; between an informed public and a misguided mob.  What is common to these struggles – and what makes their resolution an urgent matter – is that they all involve the diminishing status of truth. This does not mean that there are no truths. It simply means, as this year has made very clear, that we cannot agree on what those truths are, and when there is no consensus about the truth and no way to achieve it, chaos soon follows.  Increasingly, what counts as a fact is merely a view that someone feels to be true – and technology has made it very easy for these “facts” to circulate with a speed and reach that was unimaginable in the Gutenberg era (or even a decade ago). A dubious story about Cameron and a pig appears in a tabloid one morning, and by noon, it has flown around the world on social media and turned up in trusted news sources everywhere. This may seem like a small matter, but its consequences are enormous.  In the digital age, it is easier than ever to publish false information, which is quickly shared and taken to be true  “The Truth”, as Peter Chippindale and Chris Horrie wrote in Stick It Up Your Punter!, their history of the Sun newspaper, is a “bald statement which every newspaper prints at its peril”. There are usually several conflicting truths on any given subject, but in the era of the printing press, words on a page nailed things down, whether they turned out to be true or not. The information felt like the truth, at least until the next day brought another update or a correction, and we all shared a common set of facts.  This settled “truth” was usually handed down from above: an established truth, often fixed in place by an establishment. This arrangement was not without flaws: too much of the press often exhibited a bias towards the status quo and a deference to authority, and it was prohibitively difficult for ordinary people to challenge the power of the press. Now, people distrust much of what is presented as fact – particularly if the facts in question are uncomfortable, or out of sync with their own views – and while some of that distrust is misplaced, some of it is not.  In the digital age, it is easier than ever to publish false information, which is quickly shared and taken to be true – as we often see in emergency situations, when news is breaking in real time. To pick one example among many, during the November 2015 Paris terror attacks, rumours quickly spread on social media that the Louvre and Pompidou Centre had been hit, and that François Hollande had suffered a stroke. Trusted news organisations are needed to debunk such tall tales.  Sometimes rumours like these spread out of panic, sometimes out of malice, and sometimes deliberate manipulation, in which a corporation or regime pays people to convey their message. Whatever the motive, falsehoods and facts now spread the same way, through what academics call an “information cascade”. As the legal scholar and online-harassment expert Danielle Citron describes it, “people forward on what others think, even if the information is false, misleading or incomplete, because they think they have learned something valuable.” This cycle repeats itself, and before you know it, the cascade has unstoppable momentum. You share a friend’s post on Facebook, perhaps to show kinship or agreement or that you’re “in the know”, and thus you increase the visibility of their post to others.  Here is the news – but only if Facebook thinks you need to know | John Naughton Read more  Algorithms such as the one that powers Facebook’s news feed are designed to give us more of what they think we want – which means that the version of the world we encounter every day in our own personal stream has been invisibly curated to reinforce our pre-existing beliefs. When Eli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy, coined the term “filter bubble” in 2011, he was talking about how the personalised web – and in particular Google’s personalised search function, which means that no two people’s Google searches are the same – means that we are less likely to be exposed to information that challenges us or broadens our worldview, and less likely to encounter facts that disprove false information that others have shared.  Pariser’s plea, at the time, was that those running social media platforms should ensure that “their algorithms prioritise countervailing views and news that’s important, not just the stuff that’s most popular or most self-validating”. But in less than five years, thanks to the incredible power of a few social platforms, the filter bubble that Pariser described has become much more extreme.  On the day after the EU referendum, in a Facebook post, the British internet activist and mySociety founder, Tom Steinberg, provided a vivid illustration of the power of the filter bubble – and the serious civic consequences for a world where information flows largely through social networks:  I am actively searching through Facebook for people celebrating the Brexit leave victory, but the filter bubble is SO strong, and extends SO far into things like Facebook’s custom search that I can’t find anyone who is happy *despite the fact that over half the country is clearly jubilant today* and despite the fact that I’m *actively* looking to hear what they are saying. This echo-chamber problem is now SO severe and SO chronic that I can only beg any friends I have who actually work for Facebook and other major social media and technology to urgently tell their leaders that to not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies … We’re getting countries where one half just doesn’t know anything at all about the other.  But asking technology companies to “do something” about the filter bubble presumes that this is a problem that can be easily fixed – rather than one baked into the very idea of social networks that are designed to give you what you and your friends want to see.  Facebook, which launched only in 2004, now has 1.6bn users worldwide. It has become the dominant way for people to find news on the internet – and in fact it is dominant in ways that would have been impossible to imagine in the newspaper era. As Emily Bell has written: “Social media hasn’t just swallowed journalism, it has swallowed everything. It has swallowed political campaigns, banking systems, personal histories, the leisure industry, retail, even government and security.”  Bell, the director of the Tow Centre for Digital Journalism at Columbia University – and a board member of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian – has outlined the seismic impact of social media for journalism. “Our news ecosystem has changed more dramatically in the past five years,” she wrote in March, “than perhaps at any time in the past 500.” The future of publishing is being put into the “hands of the few, who now control the destiny of the many”. News publishers have lost control over the distribution of their journalism, which for many readers is now “filtered through algorithms and platforms which are opaque and unpredictable”. This means that social media companies have become overwhelmingly powerful in determining what we read – and enormously profitable from the monetisation of other people’s work. As Bell notes: “There is a far greater concentration of power in this respect than there has ever been in the past.”  Publications curated by editors have in many cases been replaced by a stream of information chosen by friends, contacts and family, processed by secret algorithms. The old idea of a wide-open web – where hyperlinks from site to site created a non-hierarchical and decentralised network of information – has been largely supplanted by platforms designed to maximise your time within their walls, some of which (such as Instagram and Snapchat) do not allow outward links at all.  Many people, in fact, especially teenagers, now spend more and more of their time on closed chat apps, which allow users to create groups to share messages privately – perhaps because young people, who are most likely to have faced harassment online, are seeking more carefully protected social spaces. But the closed space of a chat app is an even more restrictive silo than the walled garden of Facebook or other social networks.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘The centralisation of information is making us all much less powerful’ … Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan, who was imprisoned for six years. Photograph: Arash Ashoorinia for the Guardian  As the pioneering Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan, who was imprisoned in Tehran for six years for his online activity, wrote in the Guardian earlier this year, the “diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned” has given way to “the centralisation of information” inside a select few social networks – and the end result is “making us all less powerful in relation to government and corporations”.  Of course, Facebook does not decide what you read – at least not in the traditional sense of making decisions – and nor does it dictate what news organisations produce. But when one platform becomes the dominant source for accessing information, news organisations will often tailor their own work to the demands of this new medium. (The most visible evidence of Facebook’s influence on journalism is the panic that accompanies any change in the news feed algorithm that threatens to reduce the page views sent to publishers.)  In the last few years, many news organisations have steered themselves away from public-interest journalism and toward junk-food news, chasing page views in the vain hope of attracting clicks and advertising (or investment) – but like junk food, you hate yourself when you’ve gorged on it. The most extreme manifestation of this phenomenon has been the creation of fake news farms, which attract traffic with false reports that are designed to look like real news, and are therefore widely shared on social networks. But the same principle applies to news that is misleading or sensationally dishonest, even if it wasn’t created to deceive: the new measure of value for too many news organisations is virality rather than truth or quality.  Of course, journalists have got things wrong in the past – either by mistake or prejudice or sometimes by intent. (Freddie Starr probably didn’t eat a hamster.) So it would be a mistake to think this is a new phenomenon of the digital age. But what is new and significant is that today, rumours and lies are read just as widely as copper-bottomed facts – and often more widely, because they are wilder than reality and more exciting to share. The cynicism of this approach was expressed most nakedly by Neetzan Zimmerman, formerly employed by Gawker as a specialist in high-traffic viral stories. “Nowadays it’s not important if a story’s real,” he said in 2014. “The only thing that really matters is whether people click on it.” Facts, he suggested, are over; they are a relic from the age of the printing press, when readers had no choice. He continued: “If a person is not sharing a news story, it is, at its core, not news.”  The increasing prevalence of this approach suggests that we are in the midst of a fundamental change in the values of journalism – a consumerist shift. Instead of strengthening social bonds, or creating an informed public, or the idea of news as a civic good, a democratic necessity, it creates gangs, which spread instant falsehoods that fit their views, reinforcing each other’s beliefs, driving each other deeper into shared opinions, rather than established facts.  Contact the Guardian securely Read more  But the trouble is that the business model of most digital news organisations is based around clicks. News media around the world has reached a fever-pitch of frenzied binge-publishing, in order to scrape up digital advertising’s pennies and cents. (And there’s not much advertising to be got: in the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in the US on online advertising went to Google and Facebook. That used to go to news publishers.)  In the news feed on your phone, all stories look the same – whether they come from a credible source or not. And, increasingly, otherwise-credible sources are also publishing false, misleading, or deliberately outrageous stories. “Clickbait is king, so newsrooms will uncritically print some of the worst stuff out there, which lends legitimacy to bullshit,” said Brooke Binkowski, an editor at the debunking website Snopes, in an interview with the Guardian in April. “Not all newsrooms are like this, but a lot of them are.”  We should be careful not to dismiss anything with an appealing digital headline as clickbait – appealing headlines are a good thing, if they lead the reader to quality journalism, both serious and not. My belief is that what distinguishes good journalism from poor journalism is labour: the journalism that people value the most is that for which they can tell someone has put in a lot of work – where they can feel the effort that has been expended on their behalf, over tasks big or small, important or entertaining. It is the reverse of so-called “churnalism”, the endless recycling of other people’s stories for clicks.  The digital advertising model doesn’t currently discriminate between true or not true, just big or small. As the American political reporter Dave Weigel wrote in the wake of a hoax story that became a viral hit all the way back in 2013: “‘Too good to check’ used to be a warning to newspaper editors not to jump on bullshit stories. Now it’s a business model.”  A news-publishing industry desperately chasing down every cheap click doesn’t sound like an industry in a position of strength, and indeed, news publishing as a business is in trouble. The shift to digital publishing has been a thrilling development for journalism – as I said in my 2013 AN Smith lecture at the University of Melbourne, “The Rise of the Reader”, it has induced “a fundamental redrawing of journalists’ relationship with our audience, how we think about our readers, our perception of our role in society, our status”. It has meant we have found new ways to get stories – from our audience, from data, from social media. It has given us new ways to tell stories – with interactive technologies and now with virtual reality. It has given us new ways to distribute our journalism, to find new readers in surprising places; and it has given us new ways to engage with our audiences, opening ourselves up to challenge and debate.  But while the possibilities for journalism have been strengthened by the digital developments of the last few years, the business model is under grave threat, because no matter how many clicks you get, it will never be enough. And if you charge readers to access your journalism you have a big challenge to persuade the digital consumer who is used to getting information for free to part with their cash.  News publishers everywhere are seeing profits and revenue drop dramatically. If you want a stark illustration of the new realities of digital media, consider the first-quarter financial results announced by the New York Times and Facebook within a week of one another earlier this year. The New York Times announced that its operating profits had fallen by 13%, to $51.5m – healthier than most of the rest of the publishing industry, but quite a drop. Facebook, meanwhile, revealed that its net income had tripled in the same period – to a quite staggering $1.51bn.  Unreported Britain: without local newspapers, who is keeping tabs? Read more  Many journalists have lost their jobs in the past decade. The number of journalists in the UK shrank by up to one-third between 2001 and 2010; US newsrooms declined by a similar amount between 2006 and 2013. In Australia, there was a 20% cut in the journalistic workforce between 2012 and 2014 alone. Earlier this year, at the Guardian we announced that we would need to lose 100 journalistic positions. In March, the Independent ceased existing as a print newspaper. Since 2005, according to research by Press Gazette, the number of local newspapers in the UK has fallen by 181 – again, not because of a problem with journalism, but because of a problem with funding it.  But journalists losing their jobs is not simply a problem for journalists: it has a damaging impact on the entire culture. As the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas warned, back in 2007: “When reorganisation and cost-cutting in this core area jeopardise accustomed journalistic standards, it hits at the very heart of the political public sphere. Because, without the flow of information gained through extensive research, and without the stimulation of arguments based on an expertise that doesn’t come cheap, public communication loses its discursive vitality. The public media would then cease to resist populist tendencies, and could no longer fulfil the function it should in the context of a democratic constitutional state.”  Perhaps, then, the focus of the news industry needs to turn to commercial innovation: how to rescue the funding of journalism, which is what is under threat. Journalism has seen dramatic innovation in the last two digital decades, but business models have not. In the words of my colleague Mary Hamilton, the Guardian’s executive editor for audience: “We’ve transformed everything about our journalism and not enough about our businesses.”  The impact on journalism of the crisis in the business model is that, in chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity, news organisations undermine the very reason they exist: to find things out and tell readers the truth – to report, report, report.  Many newsrooms are in danger of losing what matters most about journalism: the valuable, civic, pounding-the-streets, sifting-the-database, asking-challenging-questions hard graft of uncovering things that someone doesn’t want you to know. Serious, public-interest journalism is demanding, and there is more of a need for it than ever. It helps keep the powerful honest; it helps people make sense of the world and their place in it. Facts and reliable information are essential for the functioning of democracy – and the digital era has made that even more obvious.

At the end of April, a two-year-long inquest ruled that the 96 people who died in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 had been unlawfully killed and had not contributed to the dangerous situation at the football ground. The verdict was the culmination of an indefatigable 27-year-campaign by the victims’ families, whose case was reported for two decades with great detail and sensitivity by Guardian journalist David Conn. His journalism helped uncover the real truth about what happened at Hillsborough, and the subsequent cover-up by the police – a classic example of a reporter holding the powerful to account on behalf of the less powerful.  What the families had been campaigning against for nearly three decades was a lie put into circulation by the Sun. The tabloid’s aggressive rightwing editor, Kelvin MacKenzie, blamed the fans for the disaster, suggesting they had forced their way into the ground without tickets – a claim later revealed to be false. According to Horrie and Chippindale’s history of The Sun, MacKenzie overruled his own reporter and put the words “THE TRUTH” on the front page, alleging that Liverpool fans were drunk, that they picked the pockets of victims, that they punched, kicked and urinated on police officers, that they shouted that they wanted sex with a dead female victim. The fans, said a “high-ranking police officer”, were “acting like animals”. The story, as Chippindale and Horrie write, is a “classic smear”, free of any attributable evidence and “precisely fitting MacKenzie’s formula by publicising the half-baked ignorant prejudice being voiced all over the country”.  It is hard to imagine that Hillsborough could happen now: if 96 people were crushed to death in front of 53,000 smartphones, with photographs and eyewitness accounts all posted to social media, would it have taken so long for the truth to come out? Today, the police – or Kelvin MacKenzie – would not have been able to lie so blatantly and for so long.  The truth is a struggle. It takes hard graft. But the struggle is worth it: traditional news values are important and they matter and they are worth defending. The digital revolution has meant that journalists – rightly, in my view – are more accountable to their audience. And as the Hillsborough story shows, the old media were certainly capable of perpetrating appalling falsehoods, which could take years to unravel. Some of the old hierarchies have been decisively undermined, which has led to a more open debate and a more substantial challenge to the old elites whose interests often dominated the media. But the age of relentless and instant information – and uncertain truths – can be overwhelming. We careen from outrage to outrage, but forget each one very quickly: it’s doomsday every afternoon.  The challenge for journalism today is to establish what role journalistic organisations still play in public discourse  At the same time, the levelling of the information landscape has unleashed new torrents of racism and sexism and new means of shaming and harassment, suggesting a world in which the loudest and crudest arguments will prevail. It is an atmosphere that has proved particularly hostile to women and people of colour, revealing that the inequalities of the physical world are reproduced all too easily in online spaces. The Guardian is not immune – which is why one of my first initiatives as editor-in-chief was to launch the Web We Want project, in order to combat a general culture of online abuse and ask how we as an institution can foster better and more civil conversations on the web.  Above all, the challenge for journalism today is not simply technological innovation or the creation of new business models. It is to establish what role journalistic organisations still play in a public discourse that has become impossibly fragmented and radically destabilised. The stunning political developments of the past year – including the vote for Brexit and the emergence of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for the US presidency – are not simply the byproducts of a resurgent populism or the revolt of those left behind by global capitalism.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The rise of Donald Trump is ‘a symptom of the mass media’s growing weakness’, according to academic Zeynep Tufekci. Photograph: Jim Cole/AP  As the academic Zeynep Tufekci argued in an essay earlier this year, the rise of Trump “is actually a symptom of the mass media’s growing weakness, especially in controlling the limits of what it is acceptable to say”. (A similar case could be made for the Brexit campaign.) “For decades, journalists at major media organisations acted as gatekeepers who passed judgment on what ideas could be publicly discussed, and what was considered too radical,” Tufekci wrote. The weakening of these gatekeepers is both positive and negative; there are opportunities and there are dangers.  As we can see from the past, the old gatekeepers were also capable of great harm, and they were often imperious in refusing space to arguments they deemed outside the mainstream political consensus. But without some form of consensus, it is hard for any truth to take hold. The decline of the gatekeepers has given Trump space to raise formerly taboo subjects, such as the cost of a global free-trade regime that benefits corporations rather than workers, an issue that American elites and much of the media had long dismissed – as well as, more obviously, allowing his outrageous lies to flourish.  When the prevailing mood is anti-elite and anti-authority, trust in big institutions, including the media, begins to crumble.  I believe that a strong journalistic culture is worth fighting for. So is a business model that serves and rewards media organisations that put the search for truth at the heart of everything – building an informed, active public that scrutinises the powerful, not an ill-informed, reactionary gang that attacks the vulnerable. Traditional news values must be embraced and celebrated: reporting, verifying, gathering together eyewitness statements, making a serious attempt to discover what really happened.  We are privileged to live in an era when we can use many new technologies – and the help of our audience – to do that. But we must also grapple with the issues underpinning digital culture, and realise that the shift from print to digital media was never just about technology. We must also address the new power dynamics that these changes have created. Technology and media do not exist in isolation – they help shape society, just as they are shaped by it in turn. That means engaging with people as civic actors, citizens, equals. It is about holding power to account, fighting for a public space, and taking responsibility for creating the kind of world we want to live in.

"CLOSE From the highly-anticipated ""She-Ra"" reboot to Robin Wright's reign on ""House of Cards,"" here's what's coming to Netflix this November. USA TODAY  The final season of Netflix's ""House of Cards"" debuts with Robin Wright as Claire Underwood, the new President of the United States after her husband's resignation from the position. ""House"" is just one of the many series that examines the drama and comedy surrounding politicians in power. Here are a few more of our favorite political television shows. (Photo: David Giesbrecht, Netflix)  Netflix is dead. Long live Netflix.  This weekend marks the end of an era for the omnipresent streaming service, with the debut of the final season of ""House of Cards.""  Canceling ""Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" (its seventh and final season is due in 2019) officially closes the streaming service's first chapter of programming, five years after it began. It was a time when the TV sky seemed limitless – no shows seemed to get canceled, old favorites were constantly being saved and streaming was a playground for writers and directors to experiment. And always, at least on the outside, it seemed to work.  It was an era when Netflix sought a handful of high-quality, high-talent series to lure new subscribers. It was the era when the Kyle Chandler-starring ""Bloodline"" and the Wachowski sibling extravaganza ""Sense8"" were among the service's top offerings because of their pedigrees alone (both series eventually were canceled in early seasons). It was a time when we thought Netflix was just trying to become HBO.  But that was 2013. And maybe 2014 and 2015. In the week ending Nov. 2, Netflix released eight new projects, including documentaries, comedy specials and movies, more than any breathing human could likely watch in a weekend. When the Emmy nominations were announced this summer, for the first time, Netflix had more than HBO.  The streaming service has spent billions of dollars on original programming in every genre, from Food Network-style baking competitions (""Sugar Rush"") to foreign language sci-fi (""Dark"") to preteen sobfests (""Alexa and Katie""). Sure, it's still fun and experimental. But just like traditional TV networks (whose audience size is made public, unlike Netflix), the streaming service is more frequently canceling shows that don't stick, including Marvel's ""Luke Cage"" and acclaimed true-crime parody ""American Vandal.""  Paris Berelc and Isabel May on ""Alexa & Katie."" (Photo: Adam Rose/Netlix)  In this new world of Netflix, ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" seem quaintly out of date, just five years after they broke ground.  Almost from the moment it began unveiling original programming – known until then for reruns of series like ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Breaking Bad"" and mail-order DVDs – Netflix changed TV. It started quietly with shows like ""Lilyhammer"" but Netflix's big coming-out moment was ""Cards,"" a drama about a ruthless politician directed by Oscar nominee David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey (then a powerhouse celebrity). It was exactly the kind of dark, serialized, twisty series that thrived in the new binge-streaming paradigm, and it became a phenomenon.  Not long after, prison dramedy ""Orange"" arrived, looking, sounding and feeling like nothing else on TV, including a cast with a wide range of races, body types, socioeconomic statuses, gender identities and sexual orientations. It told women's stories at a time in television when most other programmers were trying to find the next Walter White.  This image released by Netflix shows Taylor Schilling, left, and Uzo Aduba in a scene from ""Orange Is the New Black."" (Photo: Paul Schiraldi, AP)  ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" were showered with Emmy nominations (though their wins were few) and became the face of the streaming frontier that Netflix set out to dominate. But the streaming service doesn't need them anymore.  Sure, both shows have declined sharply in quality, which would seemingly warrant cancellation, but the reasons for their demise go beyond just their age: Netflix now has so many other options that scratch the same itches.  More: New on Netflix in November: 'House of Cards,' 'Narcos,' and plenty of Christmas films  The service has spent hundreds of millions to woo Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy from TV networks, both creators known for making shows with diverse casts and, especially Murphy, for experimenting with form. Want politics? Netflix has also signed Barack and Michelle Obama to a production deal. It has dark dramas and anti-hero shows by the dozen, from ""Ozark"" to ""The Punisher."" It won 23 Emmys this fall (tying perennial leader HBO), plus SAG Awards and Golden Globes aplenty. If you need to see its influence, look no further than the recently released ""Making a Murderer Part 2,"" which spends ample time outlining just how much the first chapter of the Netflix doc affected the media and the criminal justice system.  When Netflix launched original programming, it needed big, buzzy shows to make noise. But the streaming service is now one gigantic monster, hoarding hundreds of big, medium and little shows that cater to every possible interest. Want a baking show mixed with the a sense of the macabre? Try ""The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell."" Want a cop comedy with a cast as seemingly random as Tony Danza and Josh Groban? There's ""The Good Cop."" Want to see pretty houses? Enjoy ""The World's Most Extraordinary Homes.""  Christine McConnell on ""The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell."" (Photo: Netflix)  Netflix's brand is everything, and its audience is everyone. ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" represent a tiny sliver of that vast canvas.  Viewers' main interest in the final season of ""Cards"" is how the show moves on after Spacey was fired after allegations of sexual misconduct and assault. Had the actor not fallen from grace so publicly, ""Cards"" might have premiered its final episodes even more quietly. With so much else on Netflix's welcome screen, ""Cards"" simply isn't essential viewing anymore. On its release day this year it has to compete with a lost Orson Welles movie, a Mike Judge comedy special and two documentaries. Not to mention a Julia Roberts series a few clicks away on Netflix competitor Amazon Prime.  With every passing day, Netflix executives and their checkbooks turn their attention somewhere new. Its biggest priority now seems to be conquering the film industry. And the streamer certainly seems to be making progress on that front. It's impossible to think of a new series this year that's generated the same adoration and hype that greeted its mini-rom-com film slate, from teen sensation ""The Kissing Booth"" to the by-the-numbers ""Set It Up."" Film pundits predict that Netflix might get its first best-picture Oscar nomination for Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma,"" due in theaters this month and on Netflix in December.  So here's to ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" and the televised revolution they helped begin. It's been a wild five years. It's both exciting and terrifying to wonder what will happen in five more.

"Margot Tenenbaum, now 21 weeks pregnant. (Photograph by Katherine Wolkoff)  Manhattan, of course, has long been proudly gaunt, inhabited as it is by legions of celebrities, socialites, fashionistas, and those who would be them (remember Edith Wharton’s ethereal creatures, Lily Bart of the long, light step and the slender pink nails? Slender nails?). Only in the past few years, however, have the bump, the basketball, and the belly on two sticks entered the local lexicon. Blooming stars now strut the red carpet at the Oscars and pregnant supermodels flaunt their exposed bellies, while Us Weekly, People, and the Star intrepidly report on who has stayed admirably attenuated (Gwyneth Paltrow, Sarah Jessica Parker) and who has not (Debra Messing, Kate Hudson). In late spring, the hot gossip swirled around paparazzi shots of Paltrow emerging smilingly (triumphantly?) svelte from a London hospital. The conspiracy theory was that she hid out in the hospital for a few weeks after giving birththere’s just no way she could’ve lost so much weight so quickly. The pregnant-celeb watch is about to reach a new peak this fall, as Julia Roberts waddlesshe’s having twins; she can’t help ittoward a January due date. Toss into this roiling mix the Atkins and South Beach dietsthe latest devotionals in New York’s Church of Divine Diminishmentand you’ve got a freshly minted group neurosis. You’ve also got an unnerving question: Are women starving their babies by starving themselves?  W ay back when, in the late fifties, a woman as tortured as Sylvia Plath could be at her sunniest when she was cow-heavy and floral. Today, the prevailing attitude toward the extra flesh of maternity verges on disgust. A sampling of what women tell me they do not want to be while pregnant: a fat slob, a huge blob, sloppy, horrible like Kate Hudson, fucking gross. Tenenbaum’s language is less harsh (mushy is her preferred pejorative), but she has the same fear of becoming almost offensive, of not measuring up. She keeps worrying, she says, about an upcoming vacation with her husband’s family. There’s no way she wants to expose her girth in a bathing suit, but then she wonders if they’ll think she’s ashamed of her body if she swims in shorts and a shirt. And maybe I am ashamed, she says.  Berger sympathizes. The last time I got weighed [at the OB’s], I was really pleased the nurse just wrote the number in my chart and didn’t say it out loud, because it was so . . . If you knew how much I weighed, you’d be like, Oh, my God!’   In conversations with several dozen more pregnant women and new mothers, I was repeatedly struck by how fixated they are on the new pregnancy ideal, how much they lap up the praise if they achieve it, how anxious they are if they don’t. It’s a jungle out there, and only the scrawniest survive.  Beth Dorfman, a second-trimester periodontist, was so concerned about blowing up, and about eating healthy in general, that she consulted nutritionist Tanya Zuckerbrot early in her pregnancy (Zuckerbrot says she’s seen a significant increase in the number of women who come to her for weight-related reasons). I remember shopping with my mother and I thought, These random people walking past me on the street, I wonder if they think Hmm, that girl might be pregnant, or That girl might just have eaten seventeen cupcakes an hour ago, ’  Dorfman says.  Zuckerbrot advised Dorfman to eat more protein and fiber (pregnant women can go Atkins, by the way, as long as they eat some carbs) and turned her onto the miracle that is Scandinavian fiber crisps. They’re like sixteen calories a cracker, Dorfman says. They’re not the tastiesta nice bagel or bread would taste betterbut they satisfy some of the craving and fill me up. Dorfman promptly began eating three of the Scandinavian crisps topped with peanut butter and jelly for breakfast. Even her peanut butter is diet, she says. It’s not Skippy Reduced Fat; it’s even lower fat than that, like 2.5 grams per serving. All the calorie counting is a necessary evil, says Dorfman. When you’re pregnant, you’re only supposed to eat 300 more calories per day, she says, citing a common recommendation. That’s not much. One of those Dannon Light ’n Fit yogurts, that’s 100 calories right there.  When it comes to exercise, so many women rhapsodized to me about spotting a sublimely trim pregnant woman exercising her butt off at the local Equinox that I began to wonder whether clever health-club marketers were fitting trainers with fat pads. Meredith Paley, a vice-president at Kenneth Cole whose daughter, Ava, was born in July, is one of those who attracted gawkers. Her pregnancy-workout schedule: spinning on Tuesdays, body sculpting Wednesdays, one or two other random gym visits a week, and five-mile Central Park runs on Wednesdays, Fridays, and both weekend days. Because Paley knows that doctors recommend that pregnant women keep their heart rates under 140 beats per minute (to keep sufficient oxygen flowing to the baby), she says she always wore a monitor and walked when the number got close. A serious runner, Paley volunteers several times that intense exercise is natural for her, what makes her feel good. Still, she says, I’m the first to admit that I didn’t see pregnancy as an excuse to sit on my ass and let the pounds come.  One maternity researcher says she ﬁnds her subjects’ weight-restrictive behaviors unnerving. The pregnancy and delivery is all about them. If you can’t invest in your baby by gaining weight, I think it’s a harbinger for lack of investment in the child.  Dorfman, also an avid exerciser, is frustrated by the heart-rate cutoff. If the doctor says 140, I want to go to 137that’s just the type of person I am. I’m not going to jeopardize the health of my child, but I’m on the treadmill like, God, I’m not even sweating. I feel like it’s not doing anything.  This kind of superfit patient has become increasingly common, says Upper East Side obstetrician Shari Brasner, during the ten years she’s been in practice. She mentions a third-trimester patient who blew by her running in the park recently (It was unbelievable), and one who, after developing a painful nerve cluster in her foot, cut a hole in her sneaker rather than step off the treadmill. The doctor says it’s not hard to spot which patients are tormented by their expansion: They take ten minutes to remove every last bit of clothing, down to the rubber band on their ponytail, before getting on the scale.  Julie Tupler disavows the idea that women should be skinny or diet during pregnancy, but there’s no denying that her classes attract those who are serious about flab. You’re not supposed to gain ten pounds in the first trimester, says Patty Surak, who was eight months along, but I did. On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Surak and five other very pregnant women were assembled for a Tupler session, outfitted in oversize T-shirts and black exercise pants. One staple of Tupler’s class is a sort of pregnancy-safe sit-up. The group’s homework is 500 a day.  What’s the magic word for next week? Tupler asked.  One thousand, the group replied in unison.  You can start doing these again right after the placenta comes out, Tupler said. I had one student who even did it before!  A s is probably obvious by now, it’s not just how much weight women gain but where they gain it. Like Dante’s levels of hell, there’s a hierarchy of bad to worse. Level 1: All extra adipose tissue is smartly confined to the stomach. (That’s the baby’s body, not yours, says mother and academic body watcher Susan Bordo, author of the recently rereleased Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body.) Level 2: Your breasts get big, too, but nothing else. (I know a lot of women who get pregnant who are very flat-chested, and it’s like heaven to them, says Tenenbaum, who’s already well endowed and hasn’t felt the thrill, though her husband apparently can’t get enough: He’s like, Your boobs! They’re so big! It’s great!’ ) Level 3: Your butt and thighs puff up, or become rumply (one UrbanBaby mother’s lament). And finally, Level 4: Your face and ankles swell, a fate that befell 34-year-old publicist Katie Pottinger. My entire body widened. My face, I wouldn’t even say it was puffy; I mean, it really blew out. There was a thickening, she says, that happened all over.  The skinny-pregnancy set also lives to be told they’re having a boy. Under the old anti-feminist canard straight out of Grimm’s, girls steal their mother’s looks. I was like a preening peacock when people told me You must be having a boy,’  says Kate Walsh, an associate editor for Metropolitan Home and the new mother of a very female Evelyn. Diana Becker, a soft-spoken 28-year-old legal secretary, got the other end of the deal: You must be having a girl, a neighbor lady informed her. Why? Becker naïvely asked. Because people get fat all over when it’s a girl.",0
"Jolie redirects here. For other uses, see Jolie (disambiguation)  Angelina Jolie ( joh-LEE; born Angelina Jolie Voight, June 4, 1975)[1] is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999).  Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother survived on a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her early attempts at modeling, at her mother's insistence, proved unsuccessful.[14][15] She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a ""punk outsider,""[14] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend.[11] She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director,[12] taking at-home courses to study embalming.[16] At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies,[9][14] though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, ""I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos.""[17]  As a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed,[18] later commenting, ""For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.""[19] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder,[16] and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used ""just about every drug possible,"" particularly heroin.[20] Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.[12] When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward.[12] Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, ""I knew once I committed to Maddox, I would never be self-destructive again.""[21]  Jolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which began when Voight left the family when his daughter was less than a year old.[22] She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press.[23] They reconciled when they appeared together in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated.[9] Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname ""Voight"" in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002.[24] Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had ""serious mental problems.""[25] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight.[26] They did not speak for six-and-a-half years,[27] but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007,[26][28] before going public with their reconciliation three years later.[26]  Career  1991–1997: Early work  Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was ""too dark.""[12] She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the USC School of Cinema-Television, as well as in several music videos, namely Lenny Kravitz's ""Stand by My Woman"" (1991), Antonello Venditti's ""Alta Marea"" (1991), The Lemonheads's ""It's About Time"" (1993), and Meat Loaf's ""Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through"" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both ""drama queens.""[11]  Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.[12] Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, ""Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top.""[29] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.[30]  After starring in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her.""[31] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, ""It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.""[32]  In 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller Playing God, set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted that Jolie ""finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.""[33] Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries True Women (1997), was even less successful; writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Robert Strauss dismissed her as ""horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara"" who relies on ""gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.""[34] Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's ""Anybody Seen My Baby?"" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.[35]  1998–2000: Breakthrough  Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film.[36] George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.  Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO's Gia (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, ""Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed.""[37] For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Emmy Award. She also won her first Screen Actors Guild Award.  In accordance with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she would not be able to phone him: ""I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'""[38] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had ""nothing else to give.""[12] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting.[9] Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.[12]  Following the previously filmed gangster film Hell's Kitchen (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in Playing by Heart (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and Ryan Phillippe. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Jolie was praised in particular; San Francisco Chronicle critic Peter Stack wrote, ""Jolie, working through an overwritten part, is a sensation as the desperate club crawler learning truths about what she's willing to gamble.""[39] She won the Breakthrough Performance Award from the National Board of Review.  In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama Pushing Tin, alongside John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe dismissed her as ""a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home.""[40] Jolie then co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's paraplegic detective track down a serial killer. The film grossed $151.5 million worldwide,[41] but was critically unsuccessful. Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press concluded, ""Jolie, while always delicious to look at, is simply and woefully miscast.""[42]  ""Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim."" —Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert on Jolie's performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999)[43]  Jolie next took the supporting role of a sociopathic mental patient in Girl, Interrupted (1999), an adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. While Winona Ryder played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.[44] She won her third Golden Globe Award, her second Screen Actors Guild Award, and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. For Variety, Emanuel Levy noted, ""Jolie is excellent as the flamboyant, irresponsible girl who turns out to be far more instrumental than the doctors in Susanna's rehabilitation.""[45]  In 2000, Jolie appeared in her first summer blockbuster, Gone in 60 Seconds, which became her highest-grossing film to that point, earning $237.2 million internationally.[41] She had a minor role as the mechanic ex-girlfriend of a car thief played by Nicolas Cage; The Washington Post writer Stephen Hunter criticized that ""all she does in this movie is stand around, cooling down, modeling those fleshy, pulsating muscle-tubes that nest so provocatively around her teeth.""[46] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.  2001–2004: Mainstream recognition  Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular Tomb Raider videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; Newsday's John Anderson commented, ""Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth.""[47] The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,[41] and launched her global reputation as a female action star.  Alexander in December 2004 Jolie at the Cologne premiere ofin December 2004  Jolie next starred opposite Antonio Banderas as his mail-order bride in Original Sin (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. The New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with ""soft-core nonsense.""[48] The romantic comedy Life or Something Like It (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie. Salon's Allen Barra considered her ambitious newscaster character a rare attempt at playing a conventional women's role, noting that her performance ""doesn't get off the ground until a scene where she goes punk and leads a group of striking bus workers in singing 'Satisfaction'"".[49] Despite her lack of box office success, Jolie remained in demand as an actress;[17] in 2002, she established herself among Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, earning $10–$15 million per film for the next five years.[50]  Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.[41] She also starred in the music video for Korn's ""Did My Time"", which was used to promote the sequel. Her next film was Beyond Borders (2003), in which she portrayed a socialite who joins an aid worker played by Clive Owen. Though unsuccessful with audiences, the film stands as the first of several passion projects Jolie has made to bring attention to humanitarian causes.[51] Beyond Borders was a critical failure; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times acknowledged Jolie's ability to ""bring electricity and believability to roles,"" but wrote that ""the limbo of a hybrid character, a badly written cardboard person in a fly-infested, blood-and-guts world, completely defeats her.""[52]  The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, ""Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour.""[53] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent.[49] Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality,[54] but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.[41]  2005–2010: Commercial success  In 2005, Jolie returned to major box office success with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which she starred opposite Brad Pitt as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; Star Tribune critic Colin Covert noted, ""While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry.""[55] With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, Mr. & Mrs. Smith was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.[41][56]  Following a supporting role as the neglected wife of a CIA officer in Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006), Jolie starred as Mariane Pearl in the documentary-style drama A Mighty Heart (2007). Based on Pearl's memoir of the same name, the film chronicles the kidnapping and murder of her husband, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, in Pakistan. Although the biracial Pearl had personally chosen Jolie for the role,[57] the casting drew racial criticism and accusations of blackface.[58] The resulting performance was widely praised; Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter described it as ""well-measured and moving,"" played ""with respect and a firm grasp on a difficult accent.""[59] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Jolie also played a shape-shifting seductress, Grendel's mother, in the epic Beowulf (2007), created through motion capture. The film was critically and commercially well received, taking in revenues of $196.4 million worldwide.[41]  By 2008, Jolie was considered the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning $15–$20 million per film.[60][61] While other actresses had been forced to take salary cuts in recent years, Jolie's perceived box office appeal allowed her to command as much as $20 million plus a percentage.[62] She starred alongside James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman in the action film Wanted (2008), which proved an international success, earning $341.4 million worldwide.[41] The film received predominantly favorable reviews; writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis noted that Jolie was ""perfectly cast as a super-scary, seemingly amoral assassin,"" adding that ""she cuts the kind of disciplinarian figure who can bring boys of all ages to their knees or at least into their theater seats.""[63]  Changeling in October 2007 Jolie in character as Christine Collins on the set ofin October 2007  Jolie next took the lead role in Clint Eastwood's drama Changeling (2008).[64] Based in part on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, the film centers on Christine Collins, who is reunited with her kidnapped son in 1928 Los Angeles, only to realize the boy is an imposter. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips noted, ""Jolie really shines in the calm before the storm, the scenes when one patronizing male authority figure after another belittles her at their peril.""[65] She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a BAFTA Award, and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Jolie also voiced the DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda (2008), the first work in a major family franchise, later reprising her voice role in the sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016).  After her mother's death in 2007, Jolie began appearing in fewer films, later explaining that her motivation to be an actress had stemmed from her mother's acting ambitions.[66] Her first film in two years was the thriller Salt (2010), in which she starred as a CIA agent who goes on the run after she is accused of being a KGB sleeper agent. Originally written as a male character with Tom Cruise attached to star, agent Salt underwent a gender change after a Columbia Pictures executive suggested Jolie for the role. With revenues of $293.5 million, Salt became an international success.[41] The film received generally positive reviews, with Jolie's performance in particular earning praise; Empire critic William Thomas remarked, ""When it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business.""[67]  Jolie starred opposite Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The film was a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she ""does her darndest"" and ""plays her femme fatale with flat-out, drop-dead sexuality.""[68] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide,[41] cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences.[69] She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation that it had been given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.[70][71]  2011–present: Professional expansion  After directing the documentary A Place in Time (2007), which was distributed through the National Education Association,[72] Jolie made her feature directorial debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), a love story between a Serb soldier and a Bosniak prisoner, set during the 1992–95 Bosnian War. She conceived the film to rekindle attention for the survivors, after twice visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina in her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[73] To ensure authenticity, she cast only actors from the former Yugoslavia—including stars Goran Kostić and Zana Marjanović—and incorporated their wartime experiences into her screenplay.[74] Upon release, the film received mixed reviews; Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, ""Jolie deserves significant credit for creating such a powerfully oppressive atmosphere and staging the ghastly events so credibly, even if it is these very strengths that will make people not want to watch what's onscreen.""[75] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Jolie was named an honorary citizen of Sarajevo for raising awareness of the war.[76]  After a three-and-a-half-year absence from the screen, Jolie starred in Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of Disney's 1959 animation Sleeping Beauty. Critical reception was mixed, but Jolie's performance in the titular role was singled out for praise;[77] The Hollywood Reporter critic Sherri Linden found her to be the ""heart and soul"" of the film, adding that she ""doesn't chew the estimable scenery in Maleficent—she infuses it, wielding a magnetic and effortless power.""[78] In its opening weekend, Maleficent earned nearly $70 million at the North American box office and over $100 million in other markets, marking Jolie's appeal to audiences of all demographics in both action and fantasy films, genres usually dominated by male actors.[79] The film went on to gross $757.8 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year and Jolie's highest-grossing film ever.[41][80]  Jolie next completed her second directorial venture, Unbroken (2014), about World War II hero Louis Zamperini (1917–2014), a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash over sea and spent two years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. She also served as producer under her Jolie Pas banner.[81] Unbroken is based on Laura Hillenbrand's biography of the same name, the film was scripted by the Coen brothers and starred Jack O'Connell.[82] After a positive early reception, Unbroken was considered a likely Best Picture and Best Director contender,[82][83] but it ultimately received mixed reviews and little award recognition,[84] though it was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[85][86] In a typical review, Variety's Justin Chang noted the film's ""impeccable craftsmanship and sober restraint"", but deemed it ""an extraordinary story told in dutiful, unexceptional terms.""[84][87] Financially, Unbroken far outperformed industry expectations in its opening weekend,[88] eventually earning over $163 million worldwide.[89]  Jolie's next directorial effort was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she starred opposite her husband, Brad Pitt, marking their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Based on her screenplay, the film was a deeply personal project for Jolie, who drew inspiration from her own mother's life. Critics, however, dismissed it as a ""vanity project,"" as part of an overall poor reception.[90][91] Writing for The Washington Post, Stephanie Merry noted its dearth of genuine emotion, stating, ""By the Sea is dazzlingly gorgeous, as are its stars. But peeling back layer upon layer of exquisite ennui reveals nothing but emptiness, sprinkled with stilted sentiments.""[92] Despite starring two of Hollywood's leading actors, the film received only a limited release.[90]  As Jolie preferred to dedicate herself to her humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for the use of an exclusively Khmer cast and script.[93] Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel, Maleficent II.[94]  Humanitarian work  UNHCR ambassadorship  ""We cannot close ourselves off to information and ignore the fact that millions of people are out there suffering. I honestly want to help. I don't believe I feel differently from other people. I think we all want justice and equality, a chance for a life with meaning. All of us would like to believe that if we were in a bad situation someone would help us."" —Jolie on her motives for joining UNHCR in 2001[95]  Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia, an experience she later credited with having brought her a greater understanding of the world.[96] Upon her return home, Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots.[95] To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world. In February 2001, she went on her first field visit, an 18-day mission to Sierra Leone and Tanzania; she later expressed her shock at what she had witnessed.[95]  In the following months, Jolie returned to Cambodia for two weeks and met with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, where she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal,[97][98] the largest donation UNHCR had ever received from a private individual.[99] She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.[95] Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.[100]  Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.[101] In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, ""Awareness of the plight of these people. I think they should be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon.""[97] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, which was published in October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.  Jolie aimed to visit what she termed ""forgotten emergencies,"" crises that media attention had shifted away from.[102] She became noted for travelling to war zones,[103] such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict,[104] the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War,[105] where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces,[106] and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.[103] To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world;[17][107] she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.[108][109][110]  On April 17, 2012, after more than a decade of service as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie was promoted to the rank of Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, the first to take on such a position within the organization. In her expanded role, she was given authority to represent Guterres and UNHCR at the diplomatic level, with a focus on major refugee crises.[111] In the months following her promotion, she made her first visit as Special Envoy—her third over all—to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees,[112] and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.[113] Since then, Jolie has gone on over a dozen field missions around the world to meet with refugees and undertake advocacy on their behalf.[101][114]  Conservation and community development  In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie purchased a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project.[115] In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.[116]  In November 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.[117] She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,[115] where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.[115]  After filming Beyond Borders (2003) in Namibia, Jolie became patron of the Harnas Wildlife Foundation, a wildlife orphanage and medical center in the Kalahari desert. She first visited the Harnas farm during production of the film, which features vultures rescued by the foundation.[118] In December 2010, Jolie and her partner, Brad Pitt, established the Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Foundation to support conservation work by the Naankuse Wildlife Sanctuary, a nature reserve also located in the Kalahari.[119] In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.[120][121][122] Jolie and Pitt support other causes through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, established in September 2006.[123]  Child immigration and education  Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.""[100][124] She began lobbying humanitarian interests in the U.S. capital from 2003 onwards, explaining, ""As much as I would love to never have to visit Washington, that's the way to move the ball.""[100] Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.[125] Founded in a collaboration between Jolie and the Microsoft Corporation, by 2013, KIND had become the principal provider of pro bono lawyers for immigrant children.[126] Jolie had previously, from 2005 to 2007, funded the launch of a similar initiative, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants' National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children.[124][127]  Ms., in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage Jolie on the cover of, in 2015, in which she discusses child marriage  Jolie has also advocated for children's education. Since its founding at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in September 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions.[128] In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups.[128] The partnership has worked closely with the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Universal Education—founded by the partnership's co-chair, noted economist Gene Sperling—to establish education policies, which resulted in recommendations made to UN agencies, G8 development agencies, and the World Bank.[129] Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.[130] Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit;[131] she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.[132]  Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya,[133] which opened in 2005,[134] and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan, which opened in March 2010 and November 2012 respectively.[135][136] In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.[137] In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.[117] In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, which is expected to open in 2015 and will treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.[138]  Human rights and women's rights  British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Jolie at the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in May 2012  After Jolie joined the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in June 2007,[139] she hosted a symposium on international law and justice at CFR headquarters and funded several CFR special reports, including ""Intervention to Stop Genocide and Mass Atrocities.""[114][125] In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship,[140] a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries.[141] Its member attorneys, called Jolie Legal Fellows, have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.[140][141][142]  Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague,[143] who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011).[144] PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation.[143] Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting,[145] where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration,[143] and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.[146] In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,[147] which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.[148]  Through her work on the PSVI, Jolie met foreign policy experts Chloe Dalton and Arminka Helic, who served as special advisers to Hague. Their collaboration resulted in the 2015 founding of Jolie Pitt Dalton Helic, a partnership dedicated to women's rights and international justice, among other causes.[149] In May 2016, Jolie was appointed a visiting professor at the London School of Economics to contribute to a postgraduate degree program at the university's Centre on Women, Peace and Security,[150] which she had launched with Hague the previous year.[148]  Recognition and honors  Jolie has received wide recognition for her humanitarian work. In August 2002, she received the inaugural Humanitarian Award from the Church World Service's Immigration and Refugee Program,[151] and in October 2003, she was the first recipient of the Citizen of the World Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association.[152] She was awarded the Global Humanitarian Award by the UNA-USA in October 2005,[153] and she received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in November 2007.[154] In October 2011, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres presented Jolie with a gold pin reserved for the most long-serving staff, in recognition of her decade as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[155]  In November 2013, Jolie received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, an honorary Academy Award, from the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[156][157] In June 2014, she was appointed an Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG) for her services to the UK's foreign policy and campaigning to end sexual violence in war zones.[158][159] Queen Elizabeth II presented Jolie with the insignia of her honorary damehood during a private ceremony the following October.[160]  Personal life  Relationships and marriages  Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, ""I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way.""[161] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.[162]  During filming of Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.[12] They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.[163] Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called ""a solid man and a solid friend"".[16] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.[164][165]  Prior to her marriage to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu on the set of Foxfire (1996). She later said, ""I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her.""[166] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people.[167] In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, ""Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!""[168]  After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had met on the set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997).[165] As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.[169] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.[170] Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, ""It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but ... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.""[17]  Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She had fallen in love with Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair,[171] saying, ""To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.""[168] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.[172]  During their twelve-year relationship, ""Brangelina""—a portmanteau coined by the entertainment media—were the subject of worldwide media coverage.[173] After the initial scandal subsided, they became one of Hollywood's most glamorous couples.[174] Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted, before they announced their engagement in April 2012.[175] Jolie and Pitt married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France.[176] She subsequently took the name ""Jolie Pitt"".[177] After two years of marriage, the couple separated in September 2016. In her divorce filing, Jolie requested physical custody of their children.[178] On June 6, 2018, a new temporary custody agreement was established between Jolie and Pitt after the court's order against Jolie.[179]  Children  On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted her first child,[180] seven-month-old Maddox Chivan,[24] from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia.[181] He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001,[182] in a local village.[16] After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie returned in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him.[183] The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking.[183] Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful.[184] Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003).[183] Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone,[170][185] and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.[170][186]  Changeling in May 2008 A pregnant Jolie with director Clint Eastwood at the Cannes premiere ofin May 2008  Jolie adopted a daughter, six-month-old Zahara Marley, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 6, 2005.[187][188] Zahara was born as Yemsrach on January 8, 2005, in Awasa.[189][190] Jolie initially believed Zahara to be an AIDS orphan,[191] based on official testimony from her grandmother,[192] but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and said she thought Zahara was ""very fortunate"" to have been adopted by Jolie.[189] Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.[187] She later indicated that they had together made the decision to adopt from Ethiopia,[193] having first visited the country earlier that year.[194] After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children,[195] she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.[190] Pitt adopted Maddox and Zahara soon after.[196]  In an attempt to avoid the unprecedented media frenzy surrounding their relationship, Jolie and Pitt traveled to Namibia for the birth of their first biological child.[173] On May 27, 2006, she gave birth to a daughter, Shiloh Nouvel, in Swakopmund.[197] They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs.[196] People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time,[198] with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.[199]  On March 15, 2007, Jolie adopted a son, three-year-old Pax Thien, from an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[200] He was born as Pham Quang Sang on November 29, 2003, in HCMC, where he was abandoned by his biological mother soon after birth.[201] After visiting the orphanage with Pitt in November 2006, Jolie applied for adoption as a single parent, because Vietnam's adoption regulations do not allow unmarried couples to co-adopt.[200] After their return to the U.S., she petitioned the court to change her son's surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was approved on May 31.[202] Pitt subsequently adopted Pax on February 21, 2008.[203]  At the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, Jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. For the two weeks she spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, France, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade.[204] She gave birth to a son, Knox Léon, and a daughter, Vivienne Marcheline, on July 12, 2008. The first pictures of Knox and Vivienne were jointly sold to People and Hello! for a reported $14 million—the most expensive celebrity photographs ever taken. All proceeds were donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.[205]  Cancer prevention treatment  On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had an 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene.[206] Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer.[207][208] Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation.[209] Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts.[207] Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she underwent a preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.[208]  ""I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they have strong options."" —Jolie on her reasons for speaking out about her mastectomy[206]  After completing each operation, Jolie discussed her mastectomy and oophorectomy in op-eds published by The New York Times, with the aim of helping other women make informed health choices. She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children.[206][208][210] Jolie further wrote, ""On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.""[206]  Jolie's announcement of her mastectomy attracted widespread publicity and discussion on BRCA mutations and genetic testing.[211] Her decision was met with praise from various public figures,[212] while health campaigners welcomed her raising awareness of the options available to at-risk women.[213] Dubbed ""The Angelina Effect"" by a Time cover story,[214] Jolie's influence led to a ""global and long-lasting"" increase in BRCA gene testing:[215] the number of referrals tripled in Australia and doubled in the UK, parts of Canada, and India,[215][216][217] as well as significantly increased in other European countries and the U.S.[218][219][220] Researchers in Canada and the UK found that despite the large increase, the percentage of mutation carriers remained the same, meaning Jolie's message had reached those most at risk.[215] In her first op-ed, Jolie had advocated wider accessibility of BRCA gene testing and acknowledged the high costs,[221] which were greatly reduced after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a June 2013 ruling, invalidated BRCA gene patents held by Myriad Genetics.[222][223]  In the media  Public image  As the daughter of actor Jon Voight, Jolie appeared in the media from an early age.[23] After embarking on her own career, she earned a reputation as a ""wild child"", which contributed to her early success in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[224] Celebrity profiles routinely covered her fascination with blood and knives, experiences with drugs, and her sex life, particularly her bisexuality and interest in sadomasochism.[224][225] In 2000, when asked about her outspokenness, she stated, ""I say things that other people might go through. That's what artists should do—throw things out there and not be perfect and not have answers for anything and see if people understand.""[225] Another contributing factor of her controversial image were tabloid rumors of incest that started when Jolie, upon winning her Oscar, kissed her brother on the lips and said, ""I'm so in love with my brother right now.""[12] She dismissed the rumors, saying, ""It was disappointing that something so beautiful and pure could be turned into a circus,""[226] and explained that, as children of divorce, she and James relied on one another for emotional support.[12]  Jolie's reputation began to change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, ""In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and I fight for something important.""[100] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006.[100] Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000.[100] She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent.[227] Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston,[228] at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian.[229] A decade later, Jolie was found to be the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.[230][231]  Jolie's general influence and wealth are extensively documented. In a 2006 global industry survey by ACNielsen in 42 international markets, Jolie, together with Pitt, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide.[232] Jolie was the face of St. John and Shiseido from 2006 to 2008, and a decade later became a spokesmodel for Guerlain. Her 2011 endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton, reportedly worth $10 million, was a record for a single advertising campaign.[233][234] Jolie was among the Time 100, a list of the most influential people in the world as published by Time, in 2006 and 2008.[235][236] She was named the world's most powerful celebrity in Forbes's Celebrity 100 issue in 2009, and, though ranked lower overall, was listed as the most powerful actress from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013.[237][238] Forbes additionally cited her as Hollywood's highest-paid actress in 2009, 2011, and 2013, with estimated annual earnings of $27 million, $30 million, and $33 million respectively.[69][239][240]  Appearance  A Mighty Heart in June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible Jolie at the New York premiere ofin June 2007; several of her tattoos are visible  Jolie's public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal.[241] Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.[242] Her most recognizable physical features are her many tattoos, eyes, and in particular her full lips, which The New York Times considered as defining a feature as Kirk Douglas's chin or Bette Davis' eyes.[243] Among her estimated 20 tattoos are the Latin proverb quod me nutrit me destruit (""what nourishes me destroys me""), the Tennessee Williams quote ""A prayer for the wild at heart, kept in cages"", four Buddhist Sanskrit prayers of protection,[244][245] a twelve-inch tiger, and geographical coordinates indicating the birthplaces of her husband and children.[246] Over time, she has covered or lasered several of her tattoos, including ""Billy Bob"", the name of her second husband.[244]  Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,[247][248] with Empire stating that her ""pneumatic figure"", ""feline eyes"", and ""bee-stung lips"" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.[249] Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's ""dark and intense sexuality"" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,[49] while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having ""the most beautiful face on the planet"" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.[250]  Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, AfterEllen founder Sarah Warn observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that ""there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does"".[251] Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered ""the gold standard of beauty"",[252] with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.[253][254] After a 2011 repeat survey by Allure found that Jolie most represented the American beauty ideal, compared to model Christie Brinkley in 1991, writer Elizabeth Angell credited society with having ""branched out beyond the Barbie-doll ideal and embraced something quite different"".[255][256] In 2013, Jeffrey Kluger of Time agreed that Jolie has for many years symbolized the feminine ideal, and opined that her frank discussion of her double mastectomy redefined beauty.[214]  Filmography  Awards and nominations  Honorary Dame Commander (DCMG), Order of St Michael and St George (2014)  See also",0

"Kim Kardashian West, whose 17-hour transformation from brunette to platinum blond made headlines pretty much everywhere, has done it again. On Sunday she took to social media to announce her newest shade: a bright, bright, bright pink.  We had a hint something was coming on Saturday, when she basically sounded an alarm for a future color drop: ""I can't even tell you how over my blond hair I am!"" she tweet-raged. (As someone who is a very much dyed platinum blond too, I can attest that we all have those days.)  Kardashian West, however, did something about it. A big something. Although she hinted that she was a ""brunette at heart"" during a Create + Cultivate panel on Saturday, she definitely didn't go back to her roots with her recent dye job. Instead, she went bold—and it's pretty great.  Judging by the multiple reveal posts, she's excited about it too.  As for those of us wondering—quite rightly, given younger sis Kylie Jenner's former penchant for mixing up her look with wigs—if the look is indeed a wig, temporary, or permanent, Kim put down any confusion on Twitter before it could begin. ""I wonder if it’s just a wig or permanent color? because we know Kim doesn’t play with wigs,"" one user posited.  ""I don’t really do wigs,"" she replied. ""It’s real.""  Her stylist's Instagram backs it up: After news broke of the dye job on Sunday, her hair colorist, Chris Appleton, posted a photo of the dye in process on his 'gram (and that definitely looks like some Olaplex in the background). ""New look who dis?"" he captioned the pic.  Kim is pink, Kris is blond, Kylie has a $1.4 million push present—and we're all just still trying to keep up with those Kardashians.

"Forget Wills and Kate's dusty old Norfolk. The lovebirds want to hang out with the groovy set in the Cotswolds - and the local estate agents' eyes are lighting up.  There comes a time in every couple's relationship when the question of moving in together becomes impossible to ignore.  And when those two lovebirds have been stepping out for 15 months — even though they live 3,500 miles apart; he in the UK, she in Canada — it's not so much a case of 'if' as of 'when' they will settle down.  So it comes as no surprise that Prince Harry, 33, and his actress girlfriend Meghan Markle, 36, are said to be house-hunting.  £7.25million - North Aston Manor, Oxfordshire: This eight bedroom property, overlooking the stunning Cherwell Valley, has seven reception rooms, a spa, swimming pool and 18.2 acres with equestrian facilities. It's nine miles from Soho Farmhouse and swanky shopping centre Bicester Village, should Meghan fancy snapping up some designer bargains  Prince Harry and actress girlfriend Meghan Markle were pictured together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last month  Royal sources have exclusively told the Daily Mail that the royal couple are looking in Oxfordshire and are particularly interested in high-end properties tucked away in the rolling Cotswold hills.  A good friend of Harry's says the Prince, whose father's residence, Highgrove House, is in the south Cotswolds, has a long-standing affection for the area, while Meghan is said to be entranced by its rustic charm.  'He is searching for a new home in the area,' the friend reveals.  'Before Meghan, he was vaguely looking in Norfolk, but didn't find what he wanted. Now, with her input, he's renewed his search.'  £2million - The Old Rectory, Lower Brailes, Oxfordshire: A stunning wood-panelled property dating from the 14th century, this boasts eight bedrooms, a sun-drenched terrace and its own private lake, complete with duck house. There’s a three-bedroom coach house for guests and it’s set at the end of a no-through road.  Certainly, the lush green countryside encompassing swathes of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire is a huge draw for London-dwellers eager to snap up rural boltholes.  Just an hour or so from the capital, it's home (or at least a weekend retreat) to A-listers, politicians and media executives: the Camerons, Beckhams, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Stella McCartney all have million-pound properties in the area.  'It's like a magnet,' says Sophie Gannon, of Savills Estate Agents in Banbury, Oxfordshire. 'If you get one person, you get them all.'  However, Harry isn't following the crowd but listening to his heart. The Cotswolds, and specifically Highgrove, which was bought by his father's private estate in 1980, is where the Prince spent much of his childhood.  It was Charles and Diana's weekend home, with 15-acre grounds and, later on, a teenage haven in the cellars of the main house, which Harry nicknamed 'Club H'.  £2.95million - Fanthill, Banbury, Oxfordshire: Accessed through electric gates, up a winding driveway, this eight-bedroom house sits among 20 acres of land, so ticks all Harry’s boxes when it comes to privacy. There’s a heated outdoor pool, miniature golf course and a carp lake, where the young lovebirds could row off the private pier  A local who knows the family says: 'It's not surprising that Harry would like to live where he feels at home.  'He's lived in the Cotswolds all his life and often returns to visit his father. After his mother died, it became a place of sanctuary.  'When the boys entered their teens, Charles bought several homes in the area, thinking they might want one in the future.'  Ten years ago, Charles bought up properties adjacent to his sprawling estate, paying £2 million apiece for nearby manor houses and farm buildings.  But sources say rather than living off his father's generosity, Harry wants to invest in a place of his own.  £4.25million - Cross Hill House, Adderbury, Oxfordshire: This 10-bedroom house, surrounded by landscaped gardens, is eight miles from Soho Farmhouse. There are ample stables in the grounds as well as a reassuringly private Victorian walled garden. The centrepiece of the house is a huge open-plan sitting and dining room  He has friends and relatives dotted across the Cotswolds, an area estate agents dub the 'Royal Triangle'.  Cousin Zara, her rugby-player husband Mike Tindall and their daughter Mia, three, live six miles from Highgrove in a cottage at Gatcombe Park, Princess Anne's country estate.  The Beckham brood, of whom the Prince is very fond, have been renovating a £5 million plot on the 4,000-acre Great Tew Estate in Chipping Norton since 2015.  Palace insiders say it's this tight-knit circle of friends that has prompted the couple to focus their search on the Cotswolds rather than Norfolk, where William and Kate rule the roost at Anmer Hall, a grand Georgian pile boasting a swimming pool and tennis court.  'They don't want to be second-runners to Kate and William,' one source says.  Locals have spotted the Prince — without his girlfriend — discreetly checking out several Cotswolds hotspots in recent months.  The blacked-out Range Rovers driven by royal protection officers have been spotted navigating the country lanes around Cirencester and Stow-on-the-Wold, while Harry has apparently been sipping pints of bitter in low-key village pubs.  £7.75million - Luckington Court, Chippenham, Wiltshire: This 11th-century house with original Tudor features is set in 157 acres of woodland and pasture, surrounded by a secure fence. There are eight bedrooms, four reception rooms, two kitchens, a music room, study and plenty of space for staff — a must for any royal retreat  'I'm not surprised he's moving here — he's in the local quite often,' says one resident. 'You'd see his security men sitting outside and you'd know he'd be in there.'  Of course, there are practical reasons for moving to the Cotswolds. Harry's royal duties require him to be close to London and Toronto-based Meghan, whose time on the U.S. TV series Suits is coming to an end, wouldn't cope well with being cut off from the metropolis.  'Harry is conscious that Norfolk would be too far out for someone with media leanings and an urban upbringing like Meghan,' a source close to the couple explains.  The couple have tested the water with two mini-breaks, in February and July, at Soho Farmhouse, the private members' club-cum-hotel in Great Tew, which has become a haven for stars who want to go under the radar.  Regulars include George and Amal Clooney, while Harry's cousins Beatrice and Eugenie were recently spotted sipping mojitos by the pool.  Luxury cabins at the farmhouse — owned by the West London club Soho House, whose consultant Markus Anderson introduced Harry and Meghan last July — cost up to £725 a night, but members say it's more likely the pair took the main farmhouse for £6,000 a night.  Meghan is said to adore the £110 brightening facials and £120 evening primrose body wraps at the on-site Cowshed spa.  £3.95million - Amberley Court, Stroud, Gloucestershire: This 17th century manor boasts eight bedrooms, six receptions, a tennis court, infinity pool, stables and a two-bedroom guest lodge. It also has 22-cares of grounds. It's eight miles from Highgrove and two miles from Gatcombe Park, and within striking distance of Beaufort Polo Club, where Harry attends charity days  Proximity to the Farmhouse, as well as Daylesford Organic, a chi-chi farm shop and bakery 15 miles away, are said to be top of Meghan's requirements for a new home.  Second on her list is plenty of outside space for her two rescue dogs, Bogart and Guy.  Harry is also said to be looking for somewhere spacious, but not big or showy, so he can keep horses and turn the land into a polo field.  'That's always been his dream,' a royal source explains.  Other must-haves are a decent kitchen — Harry is a keen chef — a helipad and a space to host parties out of reach of neighbours, passing traffic and long lenses.  The royal budget should be more than enough to secure a place that meets these requirements. Harry has a fortune in excess of £30 million. Meghan is worth around £4 million from film and TV work.  But more pressing than price is how they go about finding their dream home. Royals don't peer in estate agents' windows; well-connected chums will have been asked to do research for them.  'Harry is being discreet,' a friend says. 'This is a word-of-mouth search, with Harry's friends pulling out all the stops.'  £3.95million - Amberley Court, Stroud, Gloucestershire: This 17th century manor boasts eight bedrooms, six receptions, a tennis court, infinity pool (pictured), stables and a two-bedroom guest lodge. It also has 22-cares of grounds. It's eight miles from Highgrove and two miles from Gatcombe Park, and within striking distance of Beaufort Polo Club, where Harry attends charity days  Palace sources say VanHan, a property company founded by royal confidants Thomas van Straubenzee and Rory Penn, has been given the nod to lead the hunt.  The Mayfair firm markets some of the capital's finest properties — recently including the £39 million Bulgari Hotel penthouse — to wealthy clients.  VanHan also has access to a small roster of exclusive country piles. Viewings are strictly private and the properties are labelled 'off market' to deter prying eyes.  Sources say Harry's inner circle — Tom Inskip, whose Jamaican wedding he and Meghan attended in March; Eton pal Jake Warren; filmmaker Arthur Landon and Viscount Julian Erleigh — will be alerting contacts behind the scenes, while cousin Zara, is on hand for local advice.  Of course, there is still the tricky question of timing. Traditionally, royal couples haven't lived together until after marriage, but Kate and William set a precedent in Anglesey, spending time in their North Wales home before their wedding in 2011.  Insiders say protocol dictates Harry and Meghan should at least be engaged before moving in.  So is the house-hunt a sign that a proposal is on the cards? This week, U.S. magazines claimed the couple are already engaged, after Harry popped the question in Botswana in August.  Sources close to the couple say this may not be far from the truth, with the pair starting seriously discussing marriage — a step some are calling an 'unofficial' engagement.  But the timing of an announcement would be tricky, with so many royal anniversaries taking place, not least the Queen and Philip's 70th wedding anniversary in November.  However long they have to wait, locals are thrilled by the prospect of their new neighbours.  'The last thing we want is the world and his wife trying to get into Soho Farmhouse,' one Chipping Norton resident confides. 'You get a bit fed up of the actresses swanning around. But a prince — now, that's a real celebrity.'",0

"Kimberly Noel Kardashian West[1] (born October 21, 1980) is an American reality television personality, entrepreneur and socialite. Kardashian first gained media attention as a friend and stylist of Paris Hilton, but received wider notice after a 2003 sex tape with her former boyfriend Ray J was leaked in 2007. Later that year, she and her family began to appear in the E! reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Its success soon led to the creation of spin-offs including Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami. Kardashian's personal life soon became subject to widespread media attention.[2]  In recent years, Kardashian has grown an influential online and social media presence, including tens of millions of followers on Twitter and Instagram.[3][4][5] She has released a variety of products tied to her name, including the successful 2014 mobile game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, a variety of clothing and products, and the 2015 photo book Selfish. Her relationship with rapper Kanye West has also received significant media coverage; the couple married in 2014 and they have three children together.[6]  Time magazine included Kardashian on their list of 2015's 100 most influential people,[7] while Vogue described her in 2016 as a ""pop culture phenomenon.""[8] Critics and admirers have described her as exemplifying the notion of being famous for being famous.[9][10][11] She was reported to be the highest-paid reality television personality of 2015, with her total earnings exceeding US$53 million.[12]  Early life  Kardashian was born on October 21, 1980 in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Robert and Kris (née Houghton).[13] She has an older sister, Kourtney, a younger sister, Khloé, and a younger brother, Rob.[14] Their mother is of Dutch, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry,[15] while their father was a third-generation Armenian-American.[16] After their parents divorced in 1991, her mother married again that year, to Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner),[A] the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner.[17] Through their marriage, Kardashian gained step-brothers Burton ""Burt"", Brandon, and Brody; step-sister Casey; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner.[18]  She attended Marymount High School, a Roman Catholic all-girls school in Los Angeles.[19] In 1994, her father represented football player O. J. Simpson during his murder trial. Simpson is Kardashian's godfather.[20] Kardashian's father died in 2003 of cancer.[21] In her 20s, Kardashian was the close friend and stylist of socialite Paris Hilton, through whom she first garnered media attention.[3][22]  Career  2007–2009: Breakthrough with reality television  In February 2007, a sex tape made by Kardashian and Ray J in 2003 was leaked.[23][24] Kardashian filed a lawsuit against Vivid Entertainment, who distributed the film as Kim K Superstar. She later dropped the suit and settled for a reported US$5 million.[25][26] In October 2007 Kardashian, in addition to her mother Kris Jenner, her step-parent Caitlyn Jenner (Bruce), her siblings Kourtney, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian, and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, began to appear in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[27] The series proved successful for E!, and has led to the creations of spin-offs including Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Kim Take Miami.[28] In one of the episodes, Kim discussed an offer from Playboy to appear nude in the magazine.[29] That December, Kardashian posed for a nude pictorial for Playboy.[30]  In 2008, she made her feature film debut in the disaster film spoof Disaster Movie, in which she appeared as a character named Lisa.[31][32] That same year, she was a participant on season seven of Dancing with the Stars, where she was partnered with Mark Ballas. Kardashian was the third contestant to be eliminated.[33] In January 2009, Kardashian made a cameo appearance during an episode of the sitcom How I Met Your Mother, in the episode ""Benefits"". In April, she released a workout DVD series through her television production company Kimsaprincess Productions, LLC which has seen the release of three successful workout videos, Fit in Your Jeans by Friday, with trainers Jennifer Galardi and Patrick Goudeau.[34][35][36] Kardashian played Elle in four episodes of the television series Beyond the Break.[37]  Kardashian become a guest host of WrestleMania XXIV and guest judge on America's Next Top Model in August of that year.[38] In September, Fusion Beauty and Seven Bar Foundation launched ""Kiss Away Poverty"", with Kardashian as the face of the campaign. For every LipFusion lipgloss sold, US$1 went to the Foundation to fund women entrepreneurs in the US.[39] The following month, she released her first fragrance self-titled ""Kim Kardashian"".[40][41] In December 2009, Kardashian made a guest star appearance on CBS's CSI: NY with Vanessa Minnillo.[42][43]  2010: Early endorsements and retail ventures  2010 saw Kardashian venture into several new endorsement deals, including endorsing various food products for Carl's Jr.[44][45] In January 2010, she starred as Summa Eve in the film Deep in the Valley.[42] In April, Kardashian sparked controversy over the way she held a kitten for a photograph, holding it by the scruff of its neck.[46] With sisters Kourtney and Khloé, Kardashian is involved in the retail and fashion industries. They have launched several clothing collections and fragrances. Animal rights organization PETA criticized Kardashian for repeatedly wearing fur coats, and named her as one of the five worst people or organizations of 2010 when it came to animal welfare.[47] June saw Kardashian guest star with Khloé and Kourtney as themselves on the season three premiere episode of the series 90210.[48]  That same month, Kardashian was involved in a lawsuit against one of her endorsements. Sanford Siegal, the creator of the Cookie Diet, sued Kardashian, claiming she defamed him on Twitter. According to Siegal, Kardashian tweeted in October 2009 that he was ""falsely promoting"" that she was on the cookie diet. Siegal filed a claim in a Florida state court charging that her statements were false and defamatory. He also alleged that Kardashian was on QuickTrim's payroll when she posted the tweet. Kardashian's tweet appears to stem from an article on CookieDiet.com, that named Kardashian as one of many celebrities who saw positive results on the diet. Kardashian sent a cease-and-desist order to Siegal, demanding the link be removed.[49]  On July 1, 2010, the New York City branch of Madame Tussauds revealed a wax figure of Kardashian.[50] In November, Kardashian served as producer for The Spin Crowd, a reality television show about Command PR, a New York City public relations firm, run by Jonathan Cheban and Simon Huck. The show followed them as they settle into their new offices in Los Angeles. That month, she also appeared on season ten of The Apprentice.[51][52] Kim, Kourtney, and Khloé wrote an autobiography titled Kardashian Konfidential, which was released in stores on November 23, and appeared on New York Times's Best Seller List.[53]  In December 2010, Kardashian filmed a music video for a song titled ""Jam (Turn It Up)"". The video was directed by Hype Williams; Kanye West makes a cameo in the video.[54] Kardashian premiered the song during a New Year's Eve party at TAO Las Vegas on December 31, 2010.[55] The song was produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. When asked if an album was in the works, Kardashian replied, ""There's no album in the works or anything—just one song we did for Kourtney and Kim Take New York, and a video Hype Williams directed, half of the proceeds we're giving away to a cancer foundation, because The-Dream's and one of my parents passed away from cancer. It's just all having fun—with a good cause"".[56] Jim Farber, writing for the Daily News, called the song a ""dead-brained piece of generic dance music, without a single distinguishing feature,"" and suggested that the single made Kardashian the ""worst singer in the reality TV universe.""[57]  That month, the International Business Times reported that Kardashian's 2010 earnings were the highest among Hollywood-based reality stars, estimating them at $6 million.[58][59]  As of November 2016, as per CBC Marketplace and interviews with celebrity endorsement experts, Kim Kardashian was paid between $75,000 and $300,000 for each post that she posted on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter endorsing beauty products like waist trainers, teeth whiteners as well as Coca-Cola and well known charities. Experts think that celebrities offer fake glimpses into their lives to make viewers fall for their advertising pitches, curated to look as though the viewer is catching them in a spontaneous moment when they are mostly staged.[60]  2011–2015: Legal issues and focus on social media  Kardashian in Australia for the E! News: Red carpet and dinner in 2012  In April 2011, Kardashian released her third fragrance ""Gold"".[40] Also in 2011, she filed a $20 million lawsuit against Old Navy and its parent company, Gap Inc. for right of publicity.[61] Old Navy used actress/model Melissa Molinaro in their Old Navy commercial featuring the actress singing and dancing. Kim Kardashian claimed that Old Navy used Molinaro as a look alike to Kim in order to promote their brand. Kim Kardashian was also seeking order to have the actress/model Molinaro banned from Old Navy commercials. The lawsuit never went to trial but a settlement was reached by use of a mediator in 2012; the exact settlement is unknown.[61]  In March 2012, Kardashian debuted her fourth fragrance, titled ""True Reflection"", which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote.[62] That month, Kardashian and her sisters were named in a $5 million class action lawsuit against QuickTrim, the weight loss supplement they endorse.[63] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accuses the Kardashians (along with QuickTrim's manufacturer, Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain) of false and deceptive marketing of the diet aid. The plaintiffs, hailing from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[64] In April, E! renewed Keeping Up with the Kardashians for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.[65][66] In October 2012, Kardashian released her fifth fragrance, ""Glam"", which ""draws on the glamour of her Hollywood lifestyle"", and was made available through Debenhams.[67] In summer of 2012, Kardashian and her family filmed a music video in the Dominican Republic to Notorious B.I.G's song ""Hypnotize"".[68]  Kardashian in September 2014  Kardashian appeared on the cover, and in a pictorial in Paper's winter issue in 2014 photographed by Jean-Paul Goude.[69] On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: ""Break the Internet"", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media.[70][71] The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera.[72][73] A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and ""trying to tear down"" barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was ""just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to be something more, some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us what it is like to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise.""[74] However, the stunt ""set a new benchmark"" in social media response,[75] and Paper's website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.[76][77]  Kardashian voiced the role of an alien in an episode of the adult animated series American Dad!, in season 11 (2014–15) in the episode titled ""Blagsnarst, A Love Story"" on September 21, 2014. In the episode, her character crash-lands in the town of Langley Falls. The alien then develops an attraction to her fellow alien Roger.[78][79]  In June 2014, Kardashian released a mobile game for iPhone and Android called Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. The objective of the game is to become a Hollywood star or starlet.[80] The game supports a free to play model, meaning the game is free to download, but charges for in-game items.[81] The game was a hit, earning US$1.6 million in its first five days of release.[81] In July, the game's developer Glu Mobile announced that the game was the fifth highest earning game in Apple's App Store.[81] In May 2015, Kardashian released a portfolio book called Selfish, a 325-page collection of self-taken photos of herself.[82] In December 2015, Kardashian released an emoji pack for iOS devices called Kimoji.[83] The app was a best-seller, becoming one of the top 5 most bought apps that week.[83] In August 2015, Kardashian was the cover model for Vogue Spain.[84]  2016–present  On October 2, 2016, while attending Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in the apartment where she was staying. Five individuals, dressed as police officers, bound and gagged her, then stole $10 million worth of jewelry.[85] The thieves got in her residence by threatening the concierge. Once they accessed Kardashian's room, they held a gun to her head, tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape around her mouth as a gag.[86] Kardashian, who was placed in the bathtub, was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life.[87][88][89] She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped.[90] On October 6, 2016, it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed ""on hold indefinitely"" after the robbery.[91] Production resumed on October 26.[92] Kardashian postponed a makeup demonstration in Dubai due to the incident.[93]  Kardashian made a cameo appearance in the heist film Ocean's 8, which was released on June 8, 2018.[94][95]  Fashion ventures  Kardashian is one of the many celebrity turned entrepreneurs who are able to leverage their television success by launching profitable side businesses. Kardashian is the founder of the television production company, Kimsaprincess Productions LLC, which produces workout DVDs, launched an eponymous fragrance line and the e-commerce shoe shopping website, ShoeDazzle. With her sisters Kourtney and Khloe, she also owns and is expanding D-A-S-H clothing boutiques, designed a clothing line for Bebe and nabbed diet (Quick Trim) and skincare (PerfectSkin) products endorsements.[96][97]  In 2006, Kardashian entered the business world with her two sisters and opened the boutique shop D-A-S-H in Calabasas, California.[34] In 2007, Kardashian and three partners Brian Lee, Robert Shapiro and MJ Eng founded ShoeDazzle, an online shoe and accessories website. The site now boasts more than 3 million customers, who pay a monthly fee for access to a personalized selection of shoes, jewelry and handbags every month. The site also landed a $40-million investment from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.[98] The company is valued at $280 million as of 2012.[99][100][101][102] In March 2009, she launched an endorsement with her company, ShoeDazzle shopping,[103] of which she is the co-founder and chief fashion stylist.[44] She then endorsed multiple other projects including a vanilla cupcake mix flavor called 'Va-Va-Va-Nilla' for the bakery, Famous Cupcakes.[44]  Beginning in early 2010, Kardashian and her sisters designed and developed clothing lines for Bebe stores and 'Virgins, Saints, and Angels'.[104][105][106] In April 2010, Kardashian and her sisters released a sunless tanner ""Kardashian Glamour Tan"", that month.[107] In October 2011, Kardashian and her sisters opened their Kardashian Khaos store in Las Vegas.[108] In November 2012, Kardashian and her sisters internationally launched the 'Kardashian Kollection' in England,[109][110] as well as launching a line of cosmetics, 'Khroma Beauty'.[111]  Personal life  Marriages  In 2000, 19-year-old Kardashian eloped with music producer Damon Thomas.[112] Thomas filed for divorce in 2003. Kardashian later credited their separation to physical and emotional abuse on his part.[113] Prior to the completion of her divorce, Kardashian began dating singer Ray J.[112]  In May 2011, Kardashian became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.[114] They were married in a wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[115] Earlier that month, she had released her ""wedding fragrance"" called ""Kim Kardashian Love"" which coincided with her own wedding.[40][116] A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a ""media blitz"" related to the wedding.[117] After 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences.[118] Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt, to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.[119] A man professing to be her former publicist, Jonathan Jaxson, also claimed that her short-lived marriage was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue, and subsequently settled the case which included an apology from Jaxson.[120] A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.[121] The divorce was subject to widespread media attention.[122]  Kardashian began dating rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April 2012, while still legally married to Humphries.[123] Her divorce was finalized on June 3, 2013,[124] Kardashian and West became engaged on October 21, Kardashian's 33rd birthday,[125] and married on May 24, 2014 at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy.[126] Her wedding dress was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy[127] with some guests' dresses designed by designer Michael Costello.[128]  The couple's high status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; The New York Times referred to their marriage as ""a historic blizzard of celebrity.""[6]  Religion  Kim Kardashian is a Christian and has described herself as ""really religious"".[129] Each morning, she and her family partake in a group chat in which they discuss a daily verse from the Bible.[129] She was educated in Christian schools of both the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic traditions.[129]  In April 2015, Kardashian and West traveled to the Armenian Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem to have their daughter, North, baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church. The ceremony took place at the Cathedral of St. James.[130] Khloe Kardashian was appointed the godmother of North.[131]  Health and pregnancies  Kardashian gave birth to her first child with West, daughter North West, on June 15, 2013.[132] She gave birth to her second child, son Saint West, on December 5, 2015.[133] Kardashian has been very open about her difficult pregnancies. With her first pregnancy, she suffered preeclampsia, which forced her to deliver at 34 weeks. She also suffered placenta accreta after delivery, eventually having to have surgery to remove the placenta and subsequent scar tissue.[134] After her second pregnancy, her doctors advised against trying to become pregnant again.[135] The couple's third child, a daughter, was born via surrogate on January 15, 2018.[136] On January 19, 2018, her name was announced as Chicago West.[137][138]  Wealth  As of May 2014, Kardashian was estimated to be worth US$45 million.[139] In 2015, Forbes reported she had ""made more this year than ever as her earnings nearly doubled to $53 million from 2014's $28 million"", and reported that she ""has monetized fame better than any other"".[140] Much of her income include wholesale earnings of the Sears line, the Kardashian Kollection, which raked in $600 million in 2013 and the Kardashian Beauty cosmetics line, Kardashian-branded tanning products, the boutique-line DASH, as well as sponsored Instagram and Twitter posts which are collectively worth $10,000–25,000 per post.[141] As of July 2018, Kim is worth US$350 Million[142]  Advocacy  Kardashian has expressed pride in her Armenian and Scottish ancestry.[143][144] She is not a citizen of either country and cannot speak Armenian.[145] She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide on numerous occasions, and encouraged President Barack Obama and the United States government to consider its acknowledgement.[146][147][148]  In April 2015, she traveled to Armenia with her husband, her sister Khloé, and her daughter North and visited the Armenian Genocide memorial Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan.[149] In April 2016, Kardashian wrote an article on her website condemning The Wall Street Journal for running an advertisement denying the Armenian Genocide.[150] During an interview with GQ for the July 2016 issue, Kardashian described herself as a Liberal Republican, fiscally conservative but socially progressive.[151]  Kardashian advocated for the commutation of the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who received a life sentence for a first-time drug offense, which was granted by President Donald Trump in June 2018.[152]  Filmography  As herself  As actress  Music videos  Discography  List of singles, with selected chart positions Title Year Peak chart  positions Album US  [172] US  Heat.

Jeb Bush.  Team ownership seems like the logical next step for a former player who racked up a long list of accolades over 20 years with the Yankees.  Jeter joined the team on May 29, 1995, when the Yankees’ starting shortstop was benched with an injury.  In 1996, Jeter received the American League Rookie of the Year award. In 2014, after 20 years in baseball, multiple Golden Glove and MVP awards, and five world championships, Jeter retired, with his career hits ranking sixth in major-league history.  As of April 2017, Jeter’s net worth was $185 million, according to TheRichest.  You can use Bankrate’s net worth calculator to see your net worth.

"Uh-oh. Paris Jackson got cozy with Aussie model Tyler Green during the Melbourne Cup horse race in November, and her famous family isn’t exactly moonwalking with delight. They fear the pairing could spell trouble for the 19-year-old model, who’s struggled with sobriety in the past.  “Paris’ family worries she’ll start partying again because of Tyler,” an insider exclusively tells Life & Style. Tyler, 25, has bragged about his wild ways on Instagram, posting about months of “far too much drinking” and praising “bottomless red wine and pure debauchery.”  (Photo Credit: Splash)  Despite those red flags, Paris — who’s admitted to attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and who says she was suicidal after the death of dad Michael Jackson — is smitten. “Paris is trying to walk the straight and narrow, but she’s also looking for fun,” notes the insider. “She makes her own decisions, but her family wants her to make the right ones.”  Paris’ family’s concerns about her latest romance come months after she finally called it quits with on-and-off boyfriend Michael Snoddy. Back in February, a source told Us Weekly that the duo broke up after less than a year of dating. Though the insider said that Paris could end up reconciling with Michael in the future, they also said that the aspiring actress was more focused on her career than her love life.  “It appears that Paris and Michael have parted ways for now, but their future is uncertain,” the source said, adding that Paris was very excited about her guest role on Fox’s TV drama Star. “She is doing well, enjoying being on set with Lee Daniels and focusing her energy on the opportunities ahead.”  While she has yet to make her relationship with Tyler Instagram official, Paris did post a telling quote about love on Oct. 23: “People say love ism blind because they do not know what love is.

"RUSSELL Brand has pulled on his rose-tinted spectacles to reminisce about his ""wonderful"" marriage to popstar Katy Perry live on TV.  The comedian gushed over his former flame, who he famously dumped by text in 2011 after being married for just 14 months.  6 Russell Brand has heaped praise on his 'wonderful' marriage to Katy Perry  Russell, 42, appeared on US chat programme, The Wendy Williams Show, and heaped praise on the Teenage Dream singer.

She’s such a lovely person I’ve got nothing but love for her.”  The British-born stand-up, who looked trendy in a printed blouse, went on to give his take about her latest job as judge on American Idol.  6 The comedian, 42, praised his popstar ex after he famously dumped her by text in 2011  AFP 6 The showbiz pair were married for less than two years  He continued: ""I don't know much about American Idol or things like that.  ""I certainly think that she's probably a very good judge, so I certainly wouldn't comment on how much she's earning in the negative. I wish her all the best in all of her endeavours.""  Katy and Russell's relationship was immediately thrust into the spotlight in the run-up to their nuptials in 2010.

""Because if we can’t overcome our relatively trivial personal disputes in this world, what hope is there for us?”  During their whirlwind romance Katy, now 32, and Russell got matching tattoos that read 'Go with the flow' in Sanskrit and Russell has now revealed he has no intention of removing it.  He told the magazine: “Of course I’m going to keep it.”  Getty Images - Getty 6 Katy, who is loved up with Hollywood star Orlando Bloom, has admitted she hasn't heard from Russell since 2011  Katy previously told Vogue magazine that she hadn’t heard from her ex since he called it quits on their marriage.

"Justin Bieber’s reputation as a party-loving house-trasher and terrible neighbor is biting him in the butt. Page Six reports that Beverly Hills landowners have banded together to reject Bieber from renting a house in the neighborhood.  An unnamed real estate agent told Page Six that Bieber “wants to rent a big estate, but many of the owners of the big Beverly Hills properties, which are for rent, have clubbed together to agree that nobody should rent to Justin.”  The Canadian pop star is better known for upsetting his neighbors with dangerous driving and random eggings than for his house-destroying parties, but whatever the reason, Beverly Hills residents really don’t want him in their ‘hood. Bieber is reportedly offering well over the asking rent—up to $100,000 a month—and still no one has rented him any of the places he’s interested in.  Cast out of the Bev Hills rental market, poor Bieber has been forced to move into an unidentified posh hotel in the neighborhood. He’s rented quarters in the hotel “for up to a year,” says Page Six.  Bieber has rented in Beverly Hills before, taking up residence in a $59,000-a-month glass house that looks a bit like a glamorous salad spinner. (It was a short-term lease.)",1

"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Neil Diamond's concert career spanned half a century  Singer Neil Diamond has announced he will retire from touring, after a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.  Diamond, who turns 77 on Wednesday, cancelled his March tour dates for Australia and New Zealand on medical advice.  The Solitary Man singer was midway through his 50th anniversary tour.  In a statement he said he took the decision ""with great reluctance and disappointment"".  ""I have been so honoured to bring my shows to the public for the past 50 years,"" he said.  ""My sincerest apologies to everyone who purchased tickets and were planning to come to the upcoming shows.""  Parkinson's is a progressive condition in which the brain becomes damaged. It can lead to tremors, difficulty moving, speech changes and eventually memory problems.  Diamond hopes to continue writing and recording for some time to come, a post on his website reads.  Image caption As well as his own hits, Diamond wrote the famous Monkees track I'm a Believer  ""My thanks goes out to my loyal and devoted audiences around the world,"" he said. ""You will always have my appreciation for your support and encouragement.""  With a nod to his hit Sweet Caroline, he added: ""This ride has been 'so good, so good, so good' thanks to you.""  Diamond, who has sold over 130 million albums worldwide, is set to receive a lifetime achievement award at Sunday's Grammy Awards.  The singer last performed in the UK and Ireland in October as part of the 50th anniversary world tour, but the the onset of Parkinson's disease ""has made it difficult to travel and perform on a large scale basis,"" his official website said.  Friends and fans sent their best wishes to the singer on social media as news of his retirement spread.  ""Keep fighting, old buddy. You've got a long way to go yet,"" tweeted singer Nancy Sinatra.  ""Endless admiration and love to you,"" wrote musician Josh Groban.  Rolling Stone contributing editor David Wild said Diamond was behind ""the kindest thing any star ever did for me"".",0

"The current editor in chief of Vogue magazine, Anna Wintour, has a net worth of $35 million. In addition to her net worth, she has a highly coveted position in the world of magazine publishing. She has also served as the (albeit not very flattering) inspiration for the popular novel and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. In the year 1970, Wintour was hired on as an editorial assistant for the new Harper's & Queen fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, Wintour divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit Vogue, a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later. Wintour introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Wintour favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000. Under Wintour, Vogue has continued to be one of the pillars of fashion journalism.",0

"Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday.Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: ‘No one would know your names’ if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl — Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of González have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.“Emma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,” one meme shared on Reddit’s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. González’s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post’s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,” said a post on King’s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of González at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics — a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.“The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer.Conservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student.“You will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes?” Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter.Abby Ohlheiser contributed to this report, which has been updated.Read more:Rep.

It has been widely known on the city’s hotel circuit that Taylor’s team had booked out the entire 165-room Lowry Hotel this week.  Not least because it has caused something of a headache for other visiting VIPs and superstars jetting in to the city.  That includes the host of sporting superstars and celebrities lining up for the big Soccer Aid match taking place at Old Trafford on Sunday, music megastars at Parklife, and the big fight at Manchester Arena as Tyson Fury returns to the ring.  The Soccer Aid teams have always traditionally stayed at The Lowry Hotel, as it is the preferred venue for Manchester United.  (Image: Matthew Stansfield)  But this year the stars taking part in the charity football match, who include sprint legend Usain Bolt and Take That’s Robbie Williams, are all understood to be checking into the Hilton Hotel on Deansgate instead.  There are also a huge raft of music stars heading to the city to perform at the Parklife Festival at Heaton Park - including N*E*R*D star Pharrell Williams and rock ‘n’ roll star Liam Gallagher - who have been known to stay at The Lowry on previous visits, but will have secured alternative accommodation.  Manchester’s other five star hotels, Hotel Gotham on King Street and the Radisson Blu Edwardian on Peter Street, are expected to be at capacity over the weekend.  It’s not known how much it costs to book out the entire Lowry Hotel for exclusive use.  But rooms start at £169 a night, rising up to £4,000 a night for top room at the hotel - the luxurious Presidential Suite, which comes complete with a baby grand piano.  (Image: Publicity Picture)  Taylor heads to Manchester to perform on her ongoing Reputation world tour, kicking off at the Etihad Stadium tonight, with a second gig on Saturday night.  Known for her global hits including Shake It Off, Ready for It, Blank Space and Bad Blood, 100,000 fans are expected to catch the show over the weekend.  She will have an extensive crew of dancers and musicians for the high-energy show, but the hotel rooms are also thought to have been booked out for use for others associated with the tour including marketing and PR.  The Lowry hotel’s restaurant and bar remains open to the public.  More than 300,000 revellers are expected in the city over the bumper weekend of events taking place across the city.  Meanwhile Taylor's fans are getting excited about her arrival in the UK - especially after she posted a sweet Instagram post yesterday.  (Image: Instagram/Taylor Swift)  Posing with her furry cat, Taylor said: ""Just over here daydreaming about playing Manchester tomorrow....""  Well, dream no more Taylor, the day has dawned!

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Randee Dawn  Carrie Underwood has set her sights on some serious goals. Hockey goals, that is!  That's because the Nashville Predators, for which her husband Mike Fisher is both center and captain, are currently battling it out in the Stanley Cup Finals!  And they're doing quite well; as of Monday night, the team was tied 2-2 in the series against the Pittsburgh Penguins.  Perhaps that has something to do with Underwood, who's been the biggest cheerleader of them all, posting pictures and videos on Instagram where she's decked out in Predators buttons, jersey and a hat.  Let's not forget the special mani-pedi!  She's also been making friends with at least one hockey legend: Wayne Gretzky.  We already know the Underwood/Fisher household is full of Predators fans. These days, the toddler attends games to watch daddy play, was there for his dad's 1,000th game, and Underwood even sang the national anthem before a game in April.  But having a shot at winning the Cup is a whole other level of excitement, which might explain why there was no time to do anything about Fisher's 37th birthday on Monday night. As Underwood told NBC during a game intermission yesterday, ""I didn't get him anything! I'm terrible.""  Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher at the 2013 CMT Music Awards in Nashville.

"While Jennifer has often talked about how challenging she finds the constant speculation about why she doesn’t have children, she’s always been very frank about wanting a baby.  All the way back in 2006 she even declared: ‘I’ve never in my life said I didn’t want to have children. I did and I do and I will!’  But in 2015 while still married to Justin Theroux, she hinted they were struggling with conception, telling The Hollywood Reporter: ‘Who knows if it’s going to happen?

Related: Jen Aniston pregnant with Brad Pitt's baby  New Idea  Jennifer, who is currently filming the Netflix movie Murder Mystery alongside Adam Sandler, has rekindled a relationship with Brad Pitt, but has always indicated she would happily go it alone as a single mum if the opportunity arose.  Back in 2010 she pointed out: ‘Women are realising it more and more, knowing that they don’t have to settle with a man just to have that child.’  A pregnancy couldn’t come at a better time for Jennifer.

"(Warning: This post contains spoilers for the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, which aired Tuesday.)  While offering up an overload of emotional information to Pearson family fans Tuesday, the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, called “The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning,” finally gave us the answer to the question viewers have been asking since the second season finale’s shocking flash-forward ending aired last spring: who the “her” is that Future Randall and Future Tess are preparing to visit.  The answer: Randall’s mother, Rebecca Pearson (played by Mandy Moore).  Yes, just as “This Is Us” wrapped up the first half of its third season tonight, it was revealed that decades from now, Randall and his adult daughter — along with Toby and now Beth — are going to see “Randall’s mother,” as Beth puts it to her employee (apparently she’s running a ballet company now?), who she obtains a Pin the Tail on the Donkey game from, as she prepares to join Randall and daughter on this journey.  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Midseason Finale Reveals Nicky's Fate - And It's Probably Not What You Were Expecting  Though this “her” revelation didn’t come until the episode’s closing moments — which also included a shocking twist about the fate of Jack’s little brother Nicky during the Vietnam War — we were building to it throughout the entire hour of the Dan Fogelman-created series.  The installment included scenes in the present of Rebecca accidentally upsetting young Tess while trying to address her emerging feelings toward other girls, and then relating to her enough so that she felt comfortable addressing them with her parents. The episode also ended with a fight between our Present Day Beth and Randall, because Randall refused to drop out of the city council race, when the polls show he won’t win and his wife asks him to give up and come back to helping his family.  That spat led to Randall sleeping on the couch, and a not so happy vibe between the happy couple in the present, with some hints in the future indicating the two are only communicating between Adult Tess. Does that mean they separate or even divorce?  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Melanie Liburd Is 'Really Excited' for Beth-Centric Episode - and What It Means for Zoe's Backstory (Video)  Because fans now have to wait until midseason to find out more about the future — and present — TheWrap has rounded up all the facts we’ve previously gathered about “This Is Us”s now-not-so-mysterious character, so you can theorize over the next piece of the puzzle — what are the circumstances surrounding this foreboding reunion? — for the next couple months.  See below for everything we knew — before tonight — about “her.”  Also Read: Hold Up, 'This Is Us' Fans - Mandy Moore Says You Might Actually Like That Guy With the Flowers  She’s close to Tess, Randall and Toby  In the third season premiere, the final scene gives a few more clues as to who the unnamed woman might be. Tess and Randall arrive at some sort of facility, and while Tess goes to the bathroom, Randall gives Toby (Chris Sullivan) a call, and asks if he’s “coming down.” Toby says he doesn’t know, but Randall tells him the “she” would want him here, and Toby agrees that he probably should. We see Toby talking to Randall on the phone from a bed — alone — which made us wonder if perhaps the mystery woman could be his wife Kate (Chrissy Metz), or someone close to Kate, and Kate might be dead. Yikes!  “You thought we made it sound like he was talking about Kate — I would say that’s open to interpretation,” co-showrunner Isaac Aptaker told TheWrap at the show’s Season 3 finally in September.  Alright, now we know it’s not Kate, but “Randall’s mother” — a person that is apparently close to Randall, Tess and Toby. And Sterling K. Brown told us that would be the case in the end, because anyone close to the Pearsons is close to Toby.  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown Tells Us All About the Beth-Centric Episode You've Been Waiting For  “Toby is part of our family now,” Brown said. “So anybody who Randall cares about, Tobias would obviously care about as well. That’s my brother.”  Tess hasn’t seen “her” in awhile  Back on the Season 2 finale, we got our first glimpse of an older Randall and an older Tess. “It’s time to go see her, Tess,” Randall says. Tess responds that she’s “not ready,” and Randall says he’s not either.  The scene is cut in a way that makes us think Beth might be dying (but that was ruled out by Susan Kelechi Watson herself) or maybe something is going on with Deja, who in the Season 3 premiere agreed to let the Pearsons adopt her after her mother relinquished her paternal rights.  Brown also told TheWrap that there’s a specific reason he needs to coax Tess to see “her” — which of course we’ll find out in due time.  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3 Premiere: Showrunners Break Down Jack and Rebecca's Awful First Date  “There’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular,” Brown said. “Yes, there’s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular, because Tess hadn’t seen the ‘her’ for some time. And so there’s a reason why it’s time to go and she’s like, ‘I can’t.’ There’s a reason. Other people may have been more easily galvanized, but Tess needed a little more coaxing.”  This is as far in the future as we’ll go  “This future timeline is sort of the furthest that we’ll go in these characters lives and where our series will wrap up,” Aptaker told TheWrap in September, backing up something Fogelman has previously talked about.  “I don’t imagine us going past this time period in the future so in terms of a timeline, this is our ending timeline,” Fogelman said in an interview with EW after the Season 2 finale last spring. “But we may have other past timelines we’re going to introduce in the course of the series, and also other future story lines that we might introduce as well.”  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Mandy Moore Hints Season 3 Premiere Reveals More About Randall's 'Her'  “Well we’re going to give answers in that timeline, but it doesn’t mean it’s a timeline we can’t revisit and sort of push the story forward in that timeline,” co-showrunner Elizabeth Berger told TheWrap. “We’re going to give a lot of satisfying answers regarding that timeline this season — so they’re quickly in store.”  Answers were promised to be coming soon  “I think the plan is that, in the course of the season, you will get a lot of answers,” Fogelman said, during a panel after the LA premiere in September. “The story is not about where it ends up, it’s about how you kind of get there… we’re not going to string it out over seven seasons or anything.”  Moore said Fogelman has, “talked a lot about figuring out who [Randall] is talking about.”  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: Milo Ventimiglia Hints Jack's Little Brother Nicky Has Some Real Issues  “I think that every episode is offering a more fully realized picture of who that is,” Moore said in an interview with EW earlier this month. “It’s not being dragged for the sake of being cheeky. I think it’s just really brilliant storytelling and, Dan’s old favorite way of describing the show is the mixed up videotapes of home videos. This is exactly that, but we’re leaning a little bit into the future aspect of it.”  Brown previously told EW that we do in fact know this character already.  “It is someone that we have met over the first two seasons, so it won’t be something that comes out of nowhere,” Brown said. “Dan has already spoken to the fact that we’ve already shot parts of how he wants the series to end that’s dealing with that particular ‘her’ as well. I think by about midseason, maybe episode 9 or so, the audience will know who that individual is.”  “This Is Us” Season 3 will return Jan. 15 on NBC.",0
"Former Dolphins quarterback Jay Cutler is expected to retire and could return to television as an analyst or in a reality show, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports.

"The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States…THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP:‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men.He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation.While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’“He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.”Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours.IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth.Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate.He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous.The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that.Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated.That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code.‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project.The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer.For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around.Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes.Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment.‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel.He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes.‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices.‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,’ Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers – including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses – go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things.Some developers find Mr. Trump’s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him.Preston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city’s convention center, concludes: ‘He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.’The condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another ‘super luxury’ building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? ‘You sell them a fantasy,’ Mr. Trump explains. ‘He deserves full credit for his success,’ says another builder. ‘He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: ‘Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?”‘What sets Trump apart,’ says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, ‘is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.’‘You don’t use the term ‘settlement’ with Donald.’Mr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw.He speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome.He talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine.His father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn’t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare.Mr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting.His friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to ’21’ for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn’t quite realize that he’s one of them.After dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can.Asked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons?He says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago.His greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements – he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it.The idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried. But he believes that through years of making his views known and through supporting candidaes who share his views, it could someday happen.He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers. All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything.He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.AREN’T WE LUCKY THAT THIS BRILLIANT MAN IS OUR PRESIDENT!source:https://100percentfedup.com",1
"Stranger Things is an American science fiction-horror web television series created, written, and directed by the Duffer Brothers and released on Netflix. The Duffer Brothers, Shawn Levy, and Dan Cohen serve as executive producers. The first season stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Cara Buono, and Matthew Modine, with Noah Schnapp and Joe Keery in recurring roles. For the second season, Schnapp and Keery were made series regulars, along with the additions of Sadie Sink, Dacre Montgomery, Sean Astin, and Paul Reiser; Maya Hawke joined the cast for the third season.  Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the 1980s, the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with psychokinetic abilities who helps the missing boy's friends in their own search. The second season, titled Stranger Things 2, is set one year later, and deals with attempts of the characters to return to normality and consequences that linger from the first season. The third season, titled Stranger Things 3, is set in mid-1985.  The Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside supernatural elements portrayed with childlike sensibilities. They established its time frame in the 1980s and created a homage to the pop culture of that decade. Several themes and directorial aspects were inspired and aesthetically informed by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and Stephen King, among others, including several films, anime and video games.  The first season of eight episodes premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. It received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to 1980s genre films. The second season, consisting of nine episodes, was released on October 27, 2017. In December 2017, Netflix ordered a third season, which began production in April 2018 and will consist of eight episodes, and is set to be released in 2019. The Duffer Brothers have said that Stranger Things is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. The series has received 31 Emmy Award nominations, including for Outstanding Drama Series, four Golden Globe Award nominations, and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2016.  Premise  Stranger Things is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of Energy, but secretly does experiments into the paranormal and supernatural, including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an alternate dimension called ""the Upside Down"". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.[1][2]  The first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down. His mother, Joyce, and the town's police chief, Jim Hopper, search for Will. At the same time, a young psychokinetic girl called Eleven escapes from the laboratory and assists Will's friends, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas, in their own efforts to find Will.[3]  The second season is set a year later, starting in October 1984. Will has been rescued, but few know of the details of the events. When it is discovered that Will is still being influenced by entities from the Upside Down, his friends and family learn there is a larger threat to their universe from the Upside Down.[4]  The third season is set a year later, in mid-1985, in the midst of the popularity of the film Back to the Future. Mike and Eleven have developed a relationship, as have Max and Lucas.[5][6]  Cast and characters  Episodes  Season 1 (2016)  No.  overall No. in  season Title Directed by Written by Original release date 1 1 ""Chapter One: The Vanishing of Will Byers"" The Duffer Brothers The Duffer Brothers July 15, 2016 ( ) On November 6, 1983, in a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory in the town of Hawkins, Indiana, a scientist is attacked by an unseen creature.

The next day, a buzz-cut young girl wearing a hospital gown steals food from a local diner. The owner, Benny, takes pity on her and feeds her before calling social services. From a tattoo on her arm, he learns that her name is Eleven. A woman posing as a social worker arrives and murders Benny. Armed men search the diner for Eleven, but she escapes. Will's mother Joyce believes she hears Will's voice on a distorted phone call, but her phone short circuits. Will's friends Mike, Dustin, and Lucas search for Will in the woods and find Eleven. 2 2 ""Chapter Two: The Weirdo on Maple Street"" The Duffer Brothers The Duffer Brothers July 15, 2016 ( ) The boys bring Eleven to Mike's house, where she sleeps in the basement. The next day, Mike nicknames her ""El"". She says that ""bad people"" are looking for her and refuses to meet Mike's parents. Scientists from the laboratory find a substance oozing from the walls of Joyce's home. At Mike's home, Eleven recognizes and points out Will in a photo. Dustin and Lucas want to inform Mike's parents about Eleven, but she uses psychokinesis to stop them. While searching for Will, Mr. Clarke, the boys' science teacher, discovers a scrap of a hospital gown outside the laboratory grounds. Mike's older sister Nancy goes with her friend Barb to a party at the popular Steve's house. Will's brother Jonathan investigates the woods where Will went missing. Hearing screaming, he runs to help but finds only Steve, Nancy, and their friends roughhousing around Steve's swimming pool. He secretly photographs them.

Night Shyamalan, however, due to changes at Warner Bros., its distributor, the film did not see a wide release and the Duffer Brothers were unsure of their future.[22] To their surprise, television producer Donald De Line approached them, impressed with Hidden's script, and offered them the opportunity to work on episodes of Wayward Pines alongside Shyamalan. The brothers were mentored by Shyamalan during the episode's production, so that when they finished, they felt they were ready to produce their own television series.[23]  The Duffer Brothers prepared a script that would essentially be similar to the series' actual pilot episode, along with a 20-page pitch book to help shop the series around for a network.[24] They pitched the story to about fifteen[25] cable networks, all of which rejected the script on the basis that they felt a plot centered around children as leading characters would not work, asking them to make it a children's show or to drop the children and focus on Hopper's investigation in the paranormal.[23] In early 2015, Dan Cohen, the VP of 21 Laps Entertainment, brought the script to his colleague Shawn Levy. They subsequently invited the Duffer Brothers to their office and purchased the rights for the series, giving full authorship of it to the brothers. After reading the pilot, the streaming service Netflix purchased the whole season for an undisclosed amount;[26] the show was subsequently announced for a planned 2016 release by Netflix in early April 2015.[27] The Duffer Brothers stated that at the time they had pitched to Netflix, the service had already gotten recognized for its original programming, such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black, with well-recognized producers behind them, and were ready to start giving upcoming producers like them a chance.[24] The brothers started to write out the series and brought Levy and Cohen in as executive producers to start casting and filming.[28]  ""Montauk is an eight-hour sci-fi horror epic. Set in Long Island in 1980 and inspired by the supernatural classics of that era, we explore the crossroads where the ordinary meet the extraordinary...emotional, cinematic and rooted in character, Montauk is a love letter to the golden age of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King – a marriage of human drama and supernatural fear."" — The Duffer Brothers' original pitch for Montauk[29]  Montauk, inspired by Stephen King book covers such as Firestarter The book cover the Duffer Brothers created to pitch, inspired by Stephen King book covers such as  The series was originally known as Montauk, as the setting of the script was in Montauk, New York and nearby Long Island locations.[27][30] The brothers had chosen Montauk as it had further Spielberg ties with the film Jaws, where Montauk was used for the fictional setting of Amity Island.[31] After deciding to change the narrative of the series to take place in the fictional town of Hawkins instead, the brothers felt they could now do things to the town, such as placing it under quarantine, that they really could not envision with a real location.[31] With the change in location, they had to come up with a new title for the series under direction from Netflix's Ted Sarandos so that they could start marketing it to the public. The brothers started by using a copy of Stephen King's Firestarter novel to consider the title's font and appearance, and came up with a long list of potential alternatives. Stranger Things came about as it sounded similar to another King novel, Needful Things, though Matt noted they still had a ""lot of heated arguments"" over this final title.[32]  To pitch the series, the Duffer Brothers showcased images, footage and music from 1980s films such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Poltergeist, Hellraiser, Stand by Me, Firestarter, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Jaws, in order to establish the tone of the series.[29]  With the critical success of the first season after its release in July 2016, speculation on a possible second season was raised. The Duffer Brothers initially intended for Stranger Things to either be a standalone miniseries[29] or an anthology series.[33] They also considered the possibility of setting a potential second season (which they referred to as a ""sequel"") in the early 1990s and featuring an older version of the characters, along with all new characters, who are drawn back to Hawkins after supernatural events begin occurring again.[29][33] However, following the release of the first season, they realized that the likability of the characters – especially the children – was key to the series' success, and they decided to set the second season in 1984 and focus on the same characters.[33] By the end of July, the Duffer Brothers had outlined a plan for such a season if it was green-lit,[34] and Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings said in early August that the company ""would be dumb not to"" renew Stranger Things for a second season.[35] On August 31, 2016, Netflix announced it had renewed Stranger Things for a second season of nine episodes, to be released in 2017.[36] The Duffer Brothers revealed that the series had been renewed for a second season before the first premiered. Regarding the decision to wait more than a month after the first season premiered to announce the renewal, Matt Duffer said, ""it actually ended up working because it had built up to this fever pitch. I guess that's what [Netflix] were intending to do all the time.""[37]  The Duffer Brothers wrote the second season to make the combined first and second season feel like a complete work, but setting elements in place to go forward with additional seasons if they are green-lit.[38] While most of the story for the second season had been decided before the first season aired, the Duffer Brothers took in the audience reactions from the first season to adjust some of the details within the second season. They knew they would not have the same element of audience surprise as when the show aired anew, and were aware fans wanted to see certain elements, but Ross said ""...the point is not to give everyone what they think they want. Because I don't think they really know what they want.""[39] The Duffer Brothers felt that the second season should be treated more as a sequel rather than a continuation, and thus have opted to call the second Stranger Things 2. This approach had some trepidation from Netflix, since the company felt movie sequels typically have a bad reputation, but the Duffer Brothers pointed out that there had been many successful sequels that surpassed the original film, and felt confident with this name.[40] Despite revealing episode titles for the season in the announcement teaser in order ""to provide some hint of where we were going in season two without giving anything away,""[41][37] Matt Duffer stated that some of the titles would change, since there were some things ""we didn't want to put on there because we felt like it would give too much away,""[37] and because ""people are smart on the fucking internet"" with fan-created ""videos analyzing the chapter titles... right on a lot"" of how the titles related to the plot of the season.[42] In early October 2017, the Duffer Brothers revealed the final titles for the first six episodes of the season.[43]  Levy noted in November 2016 that he and the Duffer Brothers had already begun planning a potential third season, saying, ""We are not gonna be caught off guard and we don't wanna be making stuff up like the day before we have to write it and make it, so we are definitely optimistic and we have started thinking ahead.""[44] The Duffer Brothers anticipate having about four to five seasons to work with, but do want to ""have a really finite ending"" while the show is still at a height of success, according to Matt, rather than letting it draw out indefinitely.[38] In August 2017, the Duffer Brothers confirmed there would be a third season, with the likelihood of one more season following that, with Ross saying, ""We're thinking it will be a four-season thing and then out"".[22] However, executive producer Shawn Levy later suggested that either four or five total seasons were possibilities, claiming that ""the truth is we're definitely going four seasons and there's very much the possibility of a fifth. Beyond that, it becomes I think very unlikely.""[45] Matt Duffer later commented that no official decision has been made, claiming that ""It's hard, like four seems short, five seems long. So I don't know what to do.""[46] In December 2017, Netflix officially confirmed that they have greenlit the third season,[47] consisting of eight episodes. Levy also confirmed that a fourth season was ""definitely happening"" and that there was potential for a fifth season.[19] A year later, the episode titles for season three were revealed, along with confirming the season would be named Stranger Things 3, similarly to the second season.[18]  Writing  The idea of Stranger Things started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film Prisoners, detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach. As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of ""childlike sensibilities"" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things ""was the best thing ever"". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered ""bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War"" such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia.[23] Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series,[23][48] crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror.[49] Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: Stephen King novels; films produced by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Wes Craven,[50][51][52] and Guillermo del Toro;[32] films such as Star Wars, Alien, and Stand by Me;[32][51][53] Japanese anime such as Akira and Elfen Lied;[32][50] and several video games including Silent Hill, Dark Souls and The Last of Us.[54][55][50] The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including Beyond the Black Rainbow and D.A.R.Y.L., discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the show.[31] Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the show, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.[56][57][58][59]  With Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach. They had been concerned that a 22-episode season on broadcast television would be difficult to ""tell a cinematic story"" with that many episodes. Eight episodes allowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative development; if they had less time available, they would have had to remain committed to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and abandon the characterization.[24] Within the eight episodes, the brothers aimed to make the first season ""feel like a big movie"" with all the major plot lines completed so that ""the audience feels satisfied"", but left enough unresolved to indicate ""there's a bigger mythology, and there's a lot of dangling threads at the end"", something that could be explored in further seasons if Netflix opted to create more.[60]  Regarding writing for the children characters of the series, the Duffer Brothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students while in high school and thus found it easy to write for Mike and his friends, and particularly for Barb.[32] Joyce was fashioned after Richard Dreyfuss' character Roy Neary in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, as she appears ""absolutely bonkers"" to everyone else as she tries to find Will.[61] Other characters, such as Billy in the second season, have more villainous attributes that are not necessarily obvious from the onset; Matt explained that they took further inspiration from Stephen King for these characters, as King ""always has really great human villains"" that may be more malicious than the supernatural evil.[4]  According to David Harbour, writing for the third season was still occurring in December 2017.[62] Levy said the season would be less about Will, saying, ""We're not going to put Will through hell for a third season in a row. He'll be dealing with stuff, but he won't be at rock bottom... We're [going to be] dealing with forces of evil that are new.""[63] David Harbour said that the third season also draws heavily from the film Fletch.[64]  Casting  The Duffer Brothers cast David Harbour as Chief Hopper believing this was his opportunity to have a lead character in a work.  In June 2015, it was announced that Winona Ryder and David Harbour had joined the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively.[7] The Duffer Brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in the films of the 1980s.[23] Levy believed Ryder could ""wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of [Joyce]"". Ryder praised that the show's multiple storylines required her to act for Joyce as ""she's out of her mind, but she's actually kind of onto something"", and that the producers had faith she could pull off the difficult role.[65] The Duffer Brothers had been interested in Harbour before, who until Stranger Things primarily had smaller roles as villainous characters, and they felt that he had been ""waiting too long for this opportunity"" to play a lead, while Harbour himself was thrilled by the script and the chance to play ""a broken, flawed, anti-hero character"".[32][66]  Additional casting followed two months later with Finn Wolfhard as Mike, Millie Bobby Brown in an undisclosed role, Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin, Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas, Natalia Dyer as Nancy, and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan.[8] In September 2015, Cara Buono joined the cast as Karen,[9] followed by Matthew Modine as Martin Brenner a month later.[10] Additional cast who recur for the first season include Noah Schnapp as Will,[8][13] Shannon Purser as Barbara ""Barb"" Holland,[67] Joe Keery as Steve Harrington,[14][13] and Ross Partridge as Lonnie,[68] among others.  Actors auditioning for the children roles read lines from Stand By Me.[23] The Duffer Brothers estimated they went through about a thousand different child actors for the roles. They noted that Wolfhard was already ""a movie buff"" of the films from the 1980s period and easily filled the role, while they found Matarazzo's audition to be much more authentic than most of the other audition tapes, and selected him after a single viewing of his audition tape.[24] As casting was started immediately after Netflix greenlit the show, and prior to the scripts being fully completed, this allowed some of the actor's takes on the roles to reflect into the script. The casting of the young actors for Will and his friends had been done just after the first script was completed, and subsequent scripts incorporated aspects from these actors.[60] The brothers said Modine provided significant input on the character of Dr. Brenner, whom they had not really fleshed out before as they considered him the hardest character to write for given his limited appearances within the narrative.[61]  In October 2016, it was announced that Schnapp and Keery had been promoted to the main cast for the second season, after each recurring in the first season, and that Sadie Sink and Dacre Montgomery would join the main cast as Max and Billy, respectively.[13] Ryder, Harbour, Wolfhard, Brown, Matarazzo, McLaughlin, Dyer and Heaton also return for the season.[69] Sean Astin as Bob Newby and Paul Reiser as Sam Owens are also part of the main cast in the season.[15] Sean Astin's character, Bob, was originally meant to be a smaller role, but Astin performed his role so well the Duffer Brothers ended up having Bob be a major character, as well as giving him a heroic death.[70] For Owens, the Duffer Brothers had referred to the character in their pitch to Netflix for the season as ""Paul Reiser"", and specifically alluded to Reiser's character Burke in Aliens, with Ross referencing James Cameron's casting choice for that film, saying, ""[Cameron] thought people would inherently trust [Reiser] and it would be a twist"". Reiser's son was a fan of Stranger Things, and gave his father an early appreciation of the series, so that by when the production called his agent about the role, Reiser was excited for the part.[71] Joining them in recurring roles are Linnea Berthelsen as Kali / Eight[72] and Brett Gelman as Murray Bauman.[73]  The third season sees Ryder, Harbour, Wolfhard, Brown, Matarazzo, McLaughlin, Dyer, Heaton, Buono, Schnapp, Sink, Keery and Montgomery return.[74] They are joined by Maya Hawke as Robin.[17] Additional new roles include Cary Elwes as the ""handsome, slick, and sleazy"" Mayor Kline, and Jake Busey as Bruce, a reporter for the local newspaper, described as having ""questionable morals and a sick sense of humor"".[75]  For the third season, it was reported that the several of the cast members would be receiving pay raises. Ryder and Harbour were receiving an increase to $350,000 an episode from $150,000 and $80,000 respectively; Wolfhard, Matarazzo, McLaughlin, and Schnapp were receiving a pay increase to $200,000 an episodes and possibly around $250,000, a significant increase from the reported $20,000 they made in season one (later increased by $60,000); and Dyer, Heaton, and Keery would be receiving approximately $150,000 an episode. Brown's pay was not disclosed, but was estimated to be a bigger raise than her young counterparts. Some sources suggest she is at least making $250,000 and may be getting possibly between $300,000 and $350,000 per episode.[76][77][78]  Filming  The brothers had desired to film the series around the Long Island area to match the initial Montauk concept. However, with filming scheduled to take place in November 2015, it was difficult to shoot in Long Island in the cold weather, and the production started scouting locations in and around the Atlanta, Georgia area. The brothers, who grew up in North Carolina, found many places that reminded them of their own childhoods in that area, and felt the area would work well with the narrative shift to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.[31]  The filming of the first season began in November 2015 and was extensively done in Atlanta, Georgia, with the Duffer Brothers and Levy handling the direction of individual episodes.[79] Jackson served as the basis of the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.[80][81] Other shooting locations included the Georgia Mental Health Institute as the Hawkins National Laboratory site, Bellwood Quarry, Patrick Henry High School in Stockbridge, Georgia, for the middle and high school scenes,[82] Emory University's Continuing Education Department, the former city hall in Douglasville, Georgia, the Georgia International Horse Park in Conyers, Georgia, the probate court in Butts County, Georgia, Old East Point Library and East Point First Baptist Church in East Point, Georgia, Fayetteville, Georgia, Stone Mountain Park, Palmetto, Georgia, and Winston, Georgia.[83] Set work was done at Screen Gem Studios in Atlanta.[83] The series was filmed with a Red Dragon digital camera.[61] Filming for the first season concluded in early 2016.[80]  While filming, the brothers tried to capture shots that could be seen as homages to many of the 1980s references they recalled. Their goal was not necessarily to fill the work with these references, but instead make the series seem to the viewer as a 1980s film.[32] They spent little time reviewing those works and instead went by memory. Matt further recognized that some of their filming homages were not purposely done but were found to be very comparable, as highlighted by a fan-made video comparing the show to several 1980s works side-by-side.[23][84] Matt commented on the video that ""Some were deliberate and some were subconscious.""[23] The brothers recognized that many of the iconic scenes from these 1980s films, such as with Poltergeist, was about ""taking a very ordinary object that people deal with every day, their television set, and imbuing it with something otherworldly"", leading to the idea of using the Christmas light strings for Will to communicate with Joyce.[32] In order to help the cast get into the mood and their characters, the Duffer Brothers would play creepy music on set before filming.[85]  The brothers attributed much of the 1980s feel to set and costume designers and the soundtrack composers that helped to recreate the era for them.[23] Lynda Reiss, the head of props, had about a $220,000 budget, similar to most films, to acquire artifacts of the 1980s, using eBay and searching through flea markets and estate sales around the Atlanta area. The bulk of the props were original items from the 1980s with only a few pieces, such as the Dungeons & Dragons books made as replicas.[86] Costume designer Kimberly Adams-Galligan for the first season aimed for capturing authenticity of the clothes choices by the characters, such as reflecting that the Byers would likely use hand-me-down clothes compared to the other families; in this case, while the costume department did distress the outfits for all the characters, they spent more time for Will's clothes compared to Mike's. Frequently, they needed to create outfits for the kids themselves since many were still growing during the time of filming, and could not readily acquire period fashion across a range of sizes.[87] Director of photography Tim Ives shot the first season with Leica lens and the 6K Red Scarlet Dragon to ""make sure that our images had the soft and round tones that are in '80s films""; this is achieved through digital image processing. Ives said that these cameras allow them to create an adaptable quality to the recorded film that is adaptable to a wide range of viewing experiences, including support for newer and future television technologies such as high dynamic range video that was just becoming adopted at the time of filming.[88]  Filming for the second season began on November 7, 2016,[44] once again in and around the Atlanta Metro area.[89][90] While parts of Season 2 were set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, these were actually filmed in downtown Atlanta, with skylines of Pittsburgh added in post-production.[91] Andrew Stanton, director of Pixar's Finding Nemo and WALL-E, directed the fifth and sixth episodes of the second season. Levy stated that Stanton was a big fan of the show and called up Levy, offering his directorial abilities for the show. Rebecca Thomas directed the seventh episode of the season.[92] Unlike the first season, which they were able to film without any real security issues, the heightened awareness of the show required the producers to take significant steps to keep the show's production in secret while filming the second season. They spoke to the production team of HBO's Game of Thrones for tips and advice for securing filming sites, and have adopted code names for the series and various parts to allow the actors to speak to others without revealing details of the show's plot.[93] Kim Wilcox took over for costumes in the second season, finding many of the same problems with designing for the child actors that were aging. Furthermore, she wanted to create the 1980s aesthetic but as reflected in a small rural town, with the trends of period slowly filtering into it rather that immediately jump on elements like neon colors.[87] Ives once again used Leica lens to film the season, while upgrading to the Red Weapon 8K S35 camera.[88] The second season concluded filming on June 2, 2017.[94]  Filming for the third season officially began on April 23, 2018.[78][19] Parts of filming in May 2018 were done at a re-dressed Gwinnett Place Mall near Duluth, Georgia to appear as the fictional ""Starcourt Mall"" in Hawkins, including recreating several 80s-era storefronts such as The Gap, Waldenbooks, and RadioShack within it.[95] The third season concluded filming on November 12, 2018.[96]  Visual effects  To create the aged effect for the series, a film grain was added over the footage, which was captured by scanning in film stock from the 1980s.[61] The Duffer Brothers wanted to scare the audience, but not to necessarily make the show violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s Amblin Entertainment films drove the creation of the PG-13 movie rating. It was ""much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore"", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season.[61] The brothers had wanted to avoid any computer-generated effects for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with practical effects, so they created an animatronic to play the part of the demogorgon.[97][98] However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.[23]  The title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the Stranger Things title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of R/GA, led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.[99] Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired show, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the show's titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as Altered States and The Dead Zone. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the ""missing"" theme of the show, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the show and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with ITC Benguiat, requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a ""fly through"" approach, similar to the film Bullitt, which the producers had suggested to the studio.[100]  Music  The Stranger Things original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band Survive.[101] It makes extensive use of synthesizers in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including Jean-Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, Goblin, John Carpenter, Giorgio Moroder, and Fabio Frizzi.[102]  According to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song ""Dirge"" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the show to Netflix.[101][103] The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film The Guest, where Survive features on the soundtrack.[104] Once the show was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music; the two provided the production team with dozens of songs from their band's past to gain their interest, helping to land them the role.[101] Once aboard, the two worked with producers to select some of their older music to rework for the show, while developing new music, principally with character motifs.[103] The two had been hired before the casting process, so their motif demos were used and played over the actors' audition tapes, aiding in the casting selection.[103][105] The show's theme is based on an unused work Stein composed much earlier that ended up in the library of work they shared with the production staff, who thought that with some reworking would be good for the opening credits.[101]  In addition to original music, Stranger Things features period music from artists including The Clash, Joy Division, Toto, New Order, The Bangles, Foreigner, Echo and the Bunnymen, Peter Gabriel, and Corey Hart, as well as excerpts from Tangerine Dream, John Carpenter, and Vangelis.[106][107] In particular, The Clash's ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" was specifically picked to play at pivotal moments of the story, such as when Will is trying to communicate with Joyce from the Upside Down.[107]  Soundtracks  Stranger Things' original soundtrack, consisting of 75 songs from Stein and Dixon split across two volumes, was released by Lakeshore Records. Digital release and streaming options were released on August 10 and 19, 2016 for the two volumes, respectively, while retail versions were available on September 16 and 23, 2016.[108][107] Limited editions of the soundtrack on vinyl, in both individual and a boxed set, are set for release in July 2017.[109] A cassette version of the soundtrack, sold exclusively by Urban Outfitters, was released on July 14, 2017. The cassette packaging features a cardboard cover that emulates an old VHS sleeves, while the cassette case is made to look like a VHS tape.[110]  Both volumes were nominated individually for the Best Score Soundtrack Category for the 2017 Grammy Awards, though neither won.[111]  The soundtrack for the second season of Stranger Things was released digitally on October 20, 2017. The soundtrack, once again composed by Stein and Dixon, consists of 34 songs and was released by Lakeshore Records in the United States and Invada Records internationally. The soundtrack was released on physical formats, such as compact disc, vinyl, and cassette as well.[112] On the soundtrack's composition, Stein and Dixon together said that the score for the season introduces ""new styles of composition, while still revisiting old themes when appropriate ... We've created new elements that are necessary to support the story, but still want to remain true to the sound of Season 1."" The first track from the soundtrack, ""Walkin' in Hawkins"", was released on October 12.[113]  Release  The first season consisted of eight one-hour-long episodes which were released worldwide on Netflix on July 15, 2016,[114] in Ultra HD 4K. The second season, consisting of nine episodes, was released on October 27, 2017[115] in HDR.[116] A teaser for the second season, which also announced the release date, aired during Super Bowl LI.[117] The third season will once again consist of eight episodes,[19] and is set to be released in 2019.[118][18] Regarding the lengthy hiatus between the second and third seasons, Netflix programming executive Cindy Holland noted ""[the Duffer Brothers and Shawn Levy] understand the stakes are high. They want to deliver something bigger and better than last year. I think it's going to be a fantastic season. It will be worth the wait.""[118]  Home media  The first season of Stranger Things was released on a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack exclusively to Target retailers on October 17, 2017, and the same for the 4K/Blu-ray combo pack on November 15, 2017, both of which includes vintage CBS-FOX VHS-inspired packaging.[119][120]  Reception  Audience viewership  As Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the season based on people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, within the first 35 days of release, Stranger Things averaged ratings around 14.07 million adults between the ages 18–49 in the United States. This made it the third most-watched season of Netflix original content in the U.S. at the time behind the first season of Fuller House and fourth season of Orange Is the New Black.[121] In a September 2016 analysis, Netflix found that Stranger Things ""hooked"" viewers by the second episode of the first season, indicating that the second episode was ""the first installment that led at least 70 percent of viewers who watched that episode to complete the entire first season of a show.""[122]  In August 2017, the marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the seventh-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering slightly more than 20% of the viewers that the second season of Daredevil received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot, which ""analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers"", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.[123]  Critical response  Season Critical response Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic 1 96% (82 reviews) 76 (34 reviews) 2 94% (139 reviews) 78 (33 reviews)  Season 1  Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 96% based on 82 reviews, and a weighted average rating of 8.04/10. The site's critical consensus states, ""Exciting, heartbreaking, and sometimes scary, Stranger Things acts as an addictive homage to Spielberg films and vintage 1980s television.""[124] Review aggregator Metacritic gave the first season a normalized score of 76 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[125]  IGN gave the score of 8 out of 10 and called the series ""Great"", saying ""Stranger Things is an easy recommendation, offering viewers an atmospheric and endearing series that is a nostalgic throwback without feeling like a simple copy.""[126] In a review in the San Francisco Chronicle Dave Wiegand wrote: ""Stranger Things reminds us of a time marked by a kind of no-strings escapism. And as it does so, we find ourselves yearning for it because the Duffer Brothers have made it so irresistibly appealing. There may be other equally great shows to watch this summer, but I guarantee you won't have more fun watching any of them than you will watching Stranger Things.""[127] Joshua Alston of The A.V. Club also reviewed it positively saying, ""Balancing style and substance is always challenging for a series like Stranger Things, but the show is perfectly calibrated. It feels like watching a show produced during the era in which it's set, but with the craft of today's prestige television.""[128] Reviewing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall said, ""Over the course of the eight hours, the story and characters take on enough life of their own so that the references don't feel self-indulgent, and so that the series can be appreciated even if you don't know the plot of E.T. or the title font of Stephen King's early novels (a huge influence on the show's own opening credits) by heart.""[129]  Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker also applauded the series and wrote, ""This is astoundingly efficient storytelling, eight hours that pass in a blink, with even minor characters getting sharp dialogue, dark humor, or moments of pathos.""[130] Television critic Mary McNamara of Los Angeles Times said, ""For the most part, and in absolute defiance of the odds, Stranger Things honors its source material in the best way possible: By telling a sweet 'n' scary story in which monsters are real but so are the transformative powers of love and fealty.""[131] The Wall Street Journal's Brian Kelly said, ""Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer, brothers and the show's creators, have done their homework when it comes to '80s cinema. Whether you're a fan of John Carpenter's The Thing or The Goonies is more your speed, there's plenty to like in Stranger Things.""[132]  In a negative review, cultural critic Grafton Tanner called the series ""wish fulfillment"" and ""a window through which the present-shocked can gaze at a clichéd past.""[133] Similarly, Marinna Guzy of The Establishment wrote: ""When confronted with a story like Stranger Things, a recycled retelling of an old story being marketed as homage and good, clean nostalgia, one has to wonder whether or not studios and content creators like the Duffer Brothers ever ask themselves whether or not the story they are telling is the one that should be told. What purpose does Stranger Things serve beyond reinforcing the status quo in the media landscape and perpetuating the dangerous delusion that things were better way back when?""[134]  Season 2  On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season has an approval rating of 94% based on 139 reviews, and an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus states, ""Stranger Things' slow-building sophomore season balances moments of humor and a nostalgic sweetness against a growing horror that's all the more effective thanks to the show's full-bodied characters and evocative tone.""[135] On Metacritic, the second season has a normalized score of 78 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[136]  The second season has also been recognized by Parrot Analytics as the most in-demand digital original series of the world in 2017 and is included in the 2019 edition of Guinness World Records.[137]  Shortly after its release, Stranger Things gained a dedicated fanbase. One area of focus from these fans was the character of Barb, the nerdy friend and classmate of Nancy who is taken and killed by the monster early in the season.[138] According to actress Shannon Purser, Barb ""wasn't supposed to be a big deal"", and the Duffer Brothers had not gone into great detail about the character since the focus was on finding Will. However, many fans sympathized with the character, with Laura Bradley of Vanity Fair suggesting that these people found that Barb would be a similar misfit in society, and ""looks more like someone you might actually meet in real life"" compared to the other characters, particularly Nancy, in the series. Hashtags such as ""#ImWithBarb"" and ""#JusticeforBarb"" grew in popularity after the series' release, and several fan sites and forums were created to support her.[139] While Purser did not return for the second season, the Duffer Brothers used the real-life ""Justice for Barb"" movement as inspiration for narrative at the start of the second season, with Nancy addressing the fact ""that no one ever cares about"" Barb.[16] Purser and several media outlets took her nomination as Barb for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series in the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards as achieving ""Justice for Barb"", highlighting how well her character was received.[140][141][142]  Another impact of the series has been an increase demand for Eggo waffles, as they are shown to be Eleven's favorite food in several episodes and are seen as a representation of the show.[143] The Kellogg Company, which manufactures Eggo, had not been part of the production prior to the first season's release, but recognized the market impact of the series. It provided a vintage 1980s Eggo television advertisement for Netflix to use in its Super Bowl LI commercial, and is looking to become more involved with cross-promotion.[144]  Legal matters  In April 2018, filmmaker Charlie Kessler filed a lawsuit against the Duffer Brothers, claiming that they stole his idea behind his short film Montauk for Stranger Things. Kessler's Montauk featured a similar premise of a missing boy, a nearby military base doing otherworldy experiments, and a monster from another dimension. Kessler has directed the film and debuted it at the 2012 Hamptons International Film Festival. During the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival, he pitched his film to the Duffer Brothers and later gave them ""the script, ideas, story and film"" for a larger film idea he called The Montauk Project for their review. Kessler contended that the Duffer Brothers used his ideas to devise the premise for Stranger Things without appropriate compensation and is seeking monetary damages.[145] The Duffer Brothers' lawyer stated that the Duffer Brothers never saw Kessler's film nor spoke to him regarding it, and that Kessler had no input into their concepts for Stranger Things.[146]  Journalists have noted that the idea of supernatural events around Montauk had originated due to urban legend of the Montauk Project, which came to light from the 1992 book The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time.[147][148][149]  In September 2017, multiple media outlets published articles about a cease-and-desist letter sent by a Netflix in-house attorney to the operator of a Stranger-Things-themed pop-up bar in Chicago.[151] The letter included humorous references to the show: ""unless I'm living in the Upside Down""; ""[w]e're not going to go full Dr. Brenner on you""; ""the demogorgon is not always as forgiving."" The letter also won praise from lawyers for its even-handedness in not demanding immediate closure of the bar but, instead, only demanding that the bar not remain open without Netflix's permission past its initial scheduled run.  Accolades  Stranger Things has received numerous awards and nominations across the entertainment industry, including ten Primetime Emmy Award nominations and four Golden Globe Award nominations through the second season. The show's cast has received several of these: the show's first season cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, while series leads Ryder, Brown, and Harbour have earned individual awards and nominations.  Other media  Beyond Stranger Things  Logo for the aftershow  With the release of the second season of the series, Netflix also released Beyond Stranger Things, an aftershow hosted by Jim Rash. The guests of the aftershow are composed of cast and crew from the series, including the Duffer Brothers and the series' stars, to discuss the development and behind-the-scenes production of the series and its larger mythology. Unlike previous aftershows created by Embassy Row, such as Talking Dead and Talking Bad, Beyond Stranger Things is intended to be watched after a screening of the entire current season.[152]  Penguin Random House partnered with Netflix to release a series of books related to Stranger Things, starting in late 2018. This includes a companion book to the series, Stranger Things: World Turned Upside Down: The Official Behind-The-Scenes Companion, a children's book that offers ""advice, wisdom, and warnings"" from Stranger Things, and a prequel novel penned by Gwenda Bond focused on Eleven's mother. Additional books for adults and young readers are expected to follow.[153]  Comics  Dark Horse Comics announced a partnership with Netflix for ""a multi-year publishing line"" of stories set in the Stranger Things world. The first title would be a four-issue miniseries written by Jody Houser and interior art by Stefani Martino. The story would be set during the events of season 1, showing Will's perspective throughout his time in the Upside Down.[154] The first issue of the miniseries was released on September 26, 2018.[155]  Issue Release Date Story Art Colors Cover Collection #1[156] September 26, 2018 Jody Houser PENCILS: Stefano Martino  INKS: Keith Champagne Lauren Affe Aleksi Briclot  Rafael Albuquerque (variant)  Kyle Lambert (variant)  Patrick Satterfield (photo variant) Stranger Things – Volume 1  RELEASE DATE: 24 April 2019  9781506709765 #2[157] October 31, 2018 Aleksi Briclot  Steve Morris (variant)  Greg Ruth (variant)  Patrick Satterfield (photo variant) #3[158] November 28, 2018 Aleksi Briclot  Grzergorz Domaradzki (variant)  Matthew Taylor (variant)  Patrick Satterfield (photo variant) #4[159] January 2, 2019 Aleksi Briclot  Jen Bartel (variant)  Ethan Young (variant)  Patrick Satterfield (photo variant)  Video games  Mobile games  Netflix and BonusXP developed a free mobile game tie-in for Stranger Things, released to iOS and Android devices on October 4, 2017. The game uses a retro-pixel style of art, similar to games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game is loosely based on the Stranger Things story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.[160][161] BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game. The team decided to make the game in a similar style to The Legend of Zelda because it ""was a perfect match because both [Stranger Things and Zelda] are about exploration, and it's kind of a mysterious fit that fit the mood of the show,"" according to BonusXP president Dave Pottinger. The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their quality assurance, instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.[162] Completing the game gives players a clip from the Season 2 premiere episode of the show.[163] The game was downloaded 3 million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise. With the release of season two, an update to the game added Max as a playable character, and a release for the Amazon Fire TV, which included controller support.[162] The game was nominated for ""Mobile Game"" at the 14th British Academy Games Awards.[164][165]  A second mobile game by BonusXP, Stranger Things 3: The Game, was announced during The Game Awards 2018; it will be released as a tie-in for Stranger Things's third season.[166]  PlayStation VR game  Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that it is working on a PlayStation 4-exclusive game, based on Stranger Things, for their PlayStation VR peripheral. The company has since released a teaser showing the Christmas-lights-on-a-wall scenes.[167]  Cancelled Telltale game  In June 2018, Netflix announced plans for Telltale Games to produce an episodic adventure game based on the series, as part of a larger partnership that would see ports of other Telltale series as interactive movies on Netflix. However, the project was cancelled after Telltale laid off the majority of its staff in September 2018.[168][169][170][171][172]  Others  United States Representative David Cicilline compared the state of the nation during the presidency of Donald Trump to that of Stranger Things during a speech given in Congress on February 16, 2017, using a sign ""Trump Things"" in the same format as the title card of the show and saying ""Like the main characters in Stranger Things, we are now stuck in the Upside Down"".[173]  As part of its release on Netflix on April 14, 2017, the cast of the rebooted version of Mystery Science Theater 3000 riffed on the first part of ""Chapter 1"" of Stranger Things.[174] Google used augmented reality (AR) ""stickers"" of Stranger Things characters to introduce its ARCore technology announced alongside its Pixel 2 phone in October 2017.[175] Sesame Street created a young audience-appropriate spoof of Stranger Things, called Sharing Things, released in November 2017; it featured Cookie Monster as the ""Cookiegorgon"", Grover as Lucas, Ernie as Dustin, and included several nods to the narrative of the second season.[176]",0

"Dawson’s Creek fans finally got a cast reunion when Entertainment Weekly gathered some members of the original season — including Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson, James Van Der Beek and Michelle Williams — for a 20th anniversary shoot. However, Dawson’s parents, played by Mary-Margaret Humes and John Wesley Shipp, were not invited.  “OK, so let me get this off my chest as the initial hurt has subsided just a bit,” Humes, 63, wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday, March 29. “I send an enormous amount of love and shout outs to the thousands of followers messages and love that both @johnwesleyshippjr and I have read about being left out of @entertainmentweekly ‘s #dawsonscreek ‘reunion’ photos.”  She continued: “This was their choice … not ours … it was done behind our backs and we both were literally blindsided by it when we woke up yesterday in NYC and LA. We both did a short telephone interview after the fact, but were never told about the reunion. For months, I have been posting #behindthescenes photos to share my experiences of six years on this show. We were a #family & I know how much the photos mean to you from all the love you send me in comments … Yes, I do read them.”  She went on to explain that she will continue posting throwback photos from her time on the show, and couldn’t be more thankful for her costars and for the fans. “For the portion of our family that did appear in these photos … congratulations, you look great and I love you,” she wrote. “I only wish I had been given the opportunity to have said it to your faces. Such a shame.”  Shipp, 63, also took to Instagram to share a photo of the EW reunion, Photoshopping himself and Humes in.  The reunion included the original four cast members, as well as Mary Beth Peil (Grams), Kerr Smith (Jack), Meredith Monroe (Andie) and Busy Philipps (Audrey). Oddly enough, both Humes and Shipp starred in more episodes (93 and 83, respectively) than Monroe and Philipps (69 and 46).  In January, Us Weekly spoke to Humes about her time on the show, and she shared that she was very eager to get the cast back together.  “Everybody talks about, ‘Oh is there gonna be a reunion? Is there gonna be a convention? Is there a way to bring everybody back together again?’ Some say too many people are dead and yada, yada, yada. But in my mind, I have this thought that there’s a way to suspend your disbelief where everyone can get the happily ever after,” she said at the time. “I’m just putting it out there into the universe because I’m harboring a little secret idea and we’ll see what happens!”  Dawson’s Creek is currently streaming on Hulu.

"After a months-long investigation into claims that he acted inappropriately toward models, including allegations by Kate Upton that he forcibly groped and kissed her, Guess cofounder Paul Marciano is resigning as executive chairman.  Marciano won’t be cutting all ties with the company, which is known for its sex-centric marketing and has helped launch many young models’ careers. He will remain chief creative officer through January 2019, when his contract expires, and then will stay on as a board member, Bloomberg reports.  In a regulatory filing, Guess announced that Marciano had entered into settlements with five people arising out of claims of inappropriate conduct, for a total of $500,000. The settlements, according to the filing, were to avoid litigation costs, and did not represent an admission of “liability or fault.”  The investigators, who according to the filing interviewed 40 people and reviewed some 1.5 million pages of documents, ultimately couldn’t corroborate many of the allegations. ”In some cases, no conclusion could be reached because the individuals either declined to be interviewed or provided insufficient information to the investigators,” the filing states. “And, in other cases, the investigation found that credible accounts were given by both sides.”  What the investigators did conclude was that Marciano “exercised poor judgment in his communications with models and photographers,” and that he had put himself in situations that could—and did—result in “plausible allegations of improper conduct.”  Upton first went public with her allegations in January, joining the #MeToo movement on social media and later giving a detailed account to Time magazine. “After the first day of shooting the Guess Lingerie campaign [on July 25, 2010], Paul Marciano said he wanted to meet with me,” she said. “As soon as I walked in with photographer Yu Tsai, Paul came straight up to me, forcibly grabbed my breasts and started feeling them—playing with them actually. After I pushed him away, he said, ‘I’m making sure they’re real.'”  She said that after she repeatedly rebuffed him, he became hostile toward her, calling her “disgusting” and a “pig” on set and spreading rumors that she was drunk during shoots. Marciano denied Upton’s claims, telling Time that he had never touched her inappropriately, and that he would never “refer to a Guess model in such a derogatory manner.” He added that he supports the #MeToo movement, and wouldn’t allow others to defame him. Tsai, the photographer, corroborated Upton’s claims to Time.  When Guess opened its probe into Marciano, he ceased his day-to-day responsibilities at the company, and his pay was suspended. Now that the investigation is over, he will receive his salary again until January 30, according to the filing.  Meanwhile, Guess says that Marciano has begun transitioning his duties to Victor Herrero, who previously took over Marciano’s role as Guess CEO in 2015, while brother Maurice Marciano has been appointed by the board to serve as the company’s new executive chairman.",0
"'Avengers: Infinity War' Cast Reads Mean Tweets on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!': Watch  “Tom Hiddleston is so f*cking ugly why is no one acknowledging this,” the actor in question read out with a deadpan stare into the camera. In the latest edition of “Mean Tweets” on Jimmy Kimmel Live! last night (April 30,) It was time for the cast of Avengers: Infinity War to see that just because their film had the biggest box office opening of all time, didn't mean they were immune to the haters.  “Scarlett Johansson has the emotional range of a f*cking celery. I hate white people,” Johansson read with pure shock on her face.  As the segment continued, the tweets only got harsher. “Don Cheadle look like a mix between a beetle, a muskrat and a roach,” Cheadle read, “that’s just f----- up,” he added. Fittingly, Captain America got the final blow. “Perhaps Chris Evans is in truth a great actor but he plays Captain America like he’s a big dumb hunk of s---,” Evans read out as he exploded into laughter.

"She wont tell anyone his name.  Who is Angelina Jolie's boyfriend? Angelina Jolie is single and ready to mingle! Some of us are still adjusting to the fact that Brangelina is really, truly donezo. While some of us are patiently waiting on a reunion of the two movie stars, we may be holding our breaths because it seems that Angie has a new man in her life.  We don't know a whole lot about the identity of this new guy but there is talk he is British and quite well-off. A source close to the Salt actress says that the two met through mutual friends. The romance is only starting and rumors suggest that sparks are definitely flying.  Here is what we know so far about Angie's secret new beau:  1. She is keeping her new man a secret.  “Angie is keeping her cards close to her chest, but she’s very happy,” a source said. “She doesn’t want his identity to be revealed until her divorce from Brad [Pitt] is official, so she’s playing coy whenever anyone asks about her love life. She doesn’t want a media circus around her man.”  2. She's taking precaution to remain discreet.  A post shared by Angelina Jolie (@angiiii_jolie) on Jun 28, 2018 at 5:56am PDT  Sources on set say the actress only refers to her new beau “by one initial,” and has asked the producers to arrange her schedule so that she can leave town on weekends. “Apparently, they’re having romantic weekends in the English countryside, away from prying eyes, whenever they get the chance.”  3. Her kids have met him.  “She’s introduced him to the kids already, which is a sure sign that this is more than just a fling,” says the source. “They will always be her priority and she wouldn’t take that step if she didn’t see this romance lasting.”  4. This isn't the first time we're hearing about him.  A post shared by ❥ Angelina Jolie (@angelinajolie.ita) on Jun 28, 2018 at 6:10am PDT  There were reports last April that Jolie was dating this mystery man who is said to be a “reputable art dealer and philanthropist."" There was even talk of marriage. But time proved these accusations false. The fact that she is filming Maleficent 2 in London re-ignited these rumors.  5. Other sources close to her say the rumors are false.  A source told People the actress “is absolutely not seeing anyone and will not be. [She] remains focused on her kids” and isn’t interested in getting back in the dating game.  6. She has been linked to other men.  A post shared by Ed Skrein (@edskrein) on Dec 2, 2014 at 8:04am PST  Including her Maleficent 2 costar Ed Skrein. “Angie thinks Ed’s hot and she loves the idea of working with him,” a source told Star Magazine. “Obviously, he’s a great actor but she’s also looking forward to chatting with him behind the scenes. She’d love to get to know Ed and find out what makes him tick.”  7. Brad has been dating, too.  Pitt has been linked to a few other women as well including Margot Robbie — who Angelina supposedly hates. A source told OK! magazine about Brad's pursuit of Margot. “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now. [He has] tried to woo her for numerous movie projects. This was a sore subject with Angie who blocked them from working together a few times. Now he’s single again you can expect Brad to go after Margot with a passion.”  Molly Given is a writer living in Philadelphia and lover of all things to do with mystery and magic in life.

"All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth.  Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady—PA Wire  While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle’s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy’s first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.  Markle’s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.  Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.  “The gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,” she says. “While it isn’t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‘expensive,’ the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.”  Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle’s wedding dress has an “absolutely American princess feel.” “Haute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,” she adds. “Safe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.”  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys—Pool/Reuters  The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.  Similarly, the wedding dress Markle’s sister-in-law — Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge — wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate’s parents paid £150,000 — about $203,000 — for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost £250,000 — about $338,000.  However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.  “I think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,” she told ET.  But Markle didn’t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana’s dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons.",1
"Alicia Vikander has never been happier since tying the knot with Michael Fassbender!  Although the 29-year-old actress has rarely discussed her romantic relationship with Fassbender, in the cover story to Vogue’s March issue, Vikander opened up about how much she enjoys being married to the 40-year-old actor.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I feel I’m more happy and content than I’ve ever been,” Vikander revealed.  The pair tied the knot in a top-secret ceremony in Ibiza in October of last year. Vikander and Fassbender exchanged vows at the luxurious La Granja farmstead resort surrounded by friends and family, sources previously told PEOPLE.  Karwai Tang/WireImage  The star of the upcoming Tomb Raider reboot went on to admit that the pair — who met in late 2014 while filming The Light Between Oceans — might even consider working together again under the right circumstances.  “We had a great experience, apart from the fact that we…,” Vikander told Vogue before glancing down at her wedding ring with a laugh.  After calling her husband “one of the absolute best actors I’ve worked with,” the Academy Award-winning actress explained how even though he had more experience than she did when they began filming the movie, he never looked down on her and even asked her for advice on his character.  “Of course he’d done more films than me, but immediately when we started to work together he was so open to wanting me to chip in new ideas and thoughts,” she continued. “He would be like, ‘I’m stuck; what should I do?’ and I would say, ‘You’re asking me?’ That was such a sweet thing.”  “Life is about a lot more than work, but if it’s also your biggest passion, of course it’s something you enjoy talking about,” she added.

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines  In the first ""Sex and the City"" film, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) finally said ""I do"" to Mr. Big (Chris Noth). In the sequel that followed, their marriage was put to the test.  And now, even though it looks like a third movie in the franchise will never be made, we know what would have been next for the complicated couple.  Apparently, the now-scrapped script for ""Sex and the City 3"" began with killing off Big.  Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and (Chris Noth) in ""Sex and the City 2."" Courtesy Everett Collection  For his ""Origins"" podcast, journalist James Andrew Miller shared what he knows about the screenplay for the film-that-might-have-been and delved into the reason it probably won't ever be.  In fact, according to the Miller, it's all one in the same story.  He alleges one reason Kim Cattrall famously refused to do the sequel that fans and her co-stars were longing for was because of that Big plot point, which would firmly put the focus of the film on a newly widowed Carrie.  ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" (2008): Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall. Courtesy Everett Collection  ""People close to Kim believe that the script didn’t have a lot to offer the character of Samantha,” he said in the latest episode of ""Origins."" ""They point to the fact that it calls for Mr. Big to die of a heart attack in the shower, relatively early on in the film, making the remainder of the movie more about how Carrie recovers from Big's death than about the relationship between the four women.""  As for man behind Mr. Big, Noth didn't get a chance to read the script for himself, but he told Miller that from what he heard, it might have made for the best ""Sex and the City"" movie yet.  ""I heard it was really a superior script, probably from having learned from ... not the first two, but at least the second one,"" the actor noted. ""I really hate corny stuff — and it could be because I'm a little bit of a cynic — like the whole thing at the end of the (2008) movie in the shoe closet? Hated it.""  By comparison, a heart attack didn't sound so bad to him — or, evidently, to his would-be on-screen widow.  Parker visited TODAY recently and opened up to Hoda Kotb about the story they never had the chance to tell on the big screen.  ""I thought it was an exquisite, unbearably painful, heartbreaking, joyful story that felt like the beginning in a lot of ways,"" she explained. ""But it appears, for the time being, that will have to be sufficient — just having read the script will have to be enough for me.""  And, for the time being, reading about it will have to be enough for fans.",0
"Angelina Jolie has reportedly been ordered to allow Brad Pitt to spend more time with their children.  Angelina Jolie has reportedly been ordered to allow Brad Pitt to spend more time with their children.  Angelina Jolie 'ordered to allow Brad Pitt to spend more time with their children or risk losing primary custody'  The 43-year-old actress currently has primary custody over the six children - Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne - she has with her estranged husband Brad, but according to new court papers, she could lose that custody arrangement the ‘Fight Club’ star doesn’t spend more time with his brood.  According to People, a judge in the couple’s divorce case has determined that the children “not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,” and said “it is critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother.”  The judge also allegedly ordered the ‘Maleficent’ star to arrange a phone call with the children and their doctors to explain that “the court has determined that each of them are safe with their father,” after the 54-year-old actor was accused of child abuse in 2016 - of which he was eventually cleared.  Angelina Jolie  In the papers, the court has outlined a summer schedule which details how often Brad should see his brood over the coming months. The schedule involves each child except for Maddox, who is being allowed to make his own choices because he is older.  The ‘Fury’ actor is set to spend time with his kids June 8 to June 17 for four hours per day while he stays in London, where Angelina currently rents a house.  During this time, Brad is required to designate one or two of the children to spend time with at a time, and must spend time with each child at least twice.  Brad then gets custody again for 10 hours per day from June 27 through July 1, before getting all his children for four consecutive days between July 8 and July 14.

Court papers state: “If the minor children remain closed down to their father and depending on the circumstances surrounding this condition, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with [Jolie] and may result in the Court ordering primary physical custody to [Pitt].”  Executive producer Angelina Jolie arrives on the red carpet with her children, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, Knox Leon Jolie-Pitt, and Zahara Jolie-Pitt, for the film ""The Breadwinner"" at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), in Toronto, Canada, September 10, 2017.

"The third episode in Season 7 of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" finally brought Jon Snow and Daenerys together. (Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)  They are all eventful episodes at this point. And they better be. This time we got the most-anticipated meeting of the entire series with Dany and Jon finally coming face to face and we also saw another major character death. But this episode gets some bonus points because it was actually pretty funny. You’d expect things to be nothing but deadly serious as we draw closer to the conclusion, but a bit of levity like Davos’s introduction of Jon will always be welcome. Now to what happened.  [Read Alyssa Rosenberg’s review of “The Queen’s Justice""]    Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen and Kit Harington as Jon Snow in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)    Daenerys and Jon finally come face to face  As Jon, Davos and their party sail into Dragonstone, they are met by Daenerys’s greeting party led by Tyrion and Missandei. This allows Jon and Tyrion to make each other’s acquaintance for the first time since back in Season 1. That’s when Jon was just a lowly member of the Night’s Watch and Tyrion visited the Wall so he could live out one of his dreams by peeing off the top. (Those were simpler times.) “It’s been a long road but we’re both still here,” Tyrion says to Jon, which is maybe how I’ll sum things up in these recaps when they inevitably drag on and on. Jon and Davos hand over their weapons, Davos tries to make small talk with Missandei while Jon and Tyrion do the same on their trek to the castle. The conversation is interrupted when Rhaegar, Viserys and Drogon do a well-timed flyby and buzz the group. “I’d say you get used to them but you never really do,” Tyrion notes.  Walking into the throne room, Missandei introduces Daenerys like she’s about to step into the ring and fight for the unified middleweight championship of the world. “You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen. Rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Rightful Queen to the Andals and First Men. Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. The Mother of Dragons. The Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea. The Unburnt. The Breaker of Chains.”  Davos and Jon share a glance before Davos chimes in: “This is Jon Snow … he’s King in the North.” It’s the funniest moment of an episode that had a few legit laugh lines. The back and forth that follows and the conflict at the center of it gets to the main issue at the heart of the show. Daenerys wants Jon to bend the knee and pledge loyalty in her effort to take the Iron Throne. Jon could care less about the Iron Throne and is more worried about the army of dead that’s on its way to wipe out all of humanity. The very same army that almost everyone he tells about refuses to believe actually exists.  Dany does her best to talk Jon into bending the knee, using both logic and intimidation — the North has pledged in perpetuity to House Targaryen, she has the dragons, she has the Dothraki. She’ll make Jon warden of the North, he just has to bend that knee. But he won’t shut up about the White Walkers and the Night King. Dany runs through the hell she’s endured from the moment of her birth and maybe rips off a Tupac lyric in the process (“So many men have tried to kill me i don’t remember all their names”) and tells Jon that what got her through everything was faith in herself, that she was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. She does not lack confidence. Jon reminds her that she’ll rule a graveyard if the Night King isn’t stopped. Davos steps up and tells everyone that Jon is no slouch himself. Maybe Dany has destiny on her side, but look at Jon — from bastard to King in the North, the first to bring men and wildlings together, he even took a knife in the heart and gave his own li — hold that thought, Davos. Jon shoots him a look. Let’s not get into the whole black magic resurrection thing right now, we just met these people.  Tyrion finally says what we were all thinking — if these battles of the living don’t matter, then what’s the harm in just bending the knee? But Jon still can’t do it, and to Dany this means he’s in open rebellion. But she won’t make him a prisoner. Yet.  Jon and Tyrion get more time to catch up when they go separately to the designated brooding corner of Dragonstone. Tyrion is brooding because he didn’t see the Euron Greyjoy’s surprise attack coming; Jon is brooding because it is simply what he does. “You make me feel like I’m failing at brooding,” Tyrion tells Jon (another laugh line!), before telling him that he actually believes Jon about the White Walkers. That doesn’t mean it will be easy to convince other people, whose minds can handle the idea of a problem like Cersei (“a familiar monster”) but not one like an army of the dead. Tyrion expertly finds a middle ground, though — he convinces Jon that Daenerys is on the side of good and that it’s unreasonable to expect her to commit to fighting an enemy she hasn’t seen as explained by a man she doesn’t know. So what’s something reasonable he can help Jon with?    Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen and Kit Harington as Jon Snow in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  And that would be the dragonglass buried beneath Dragonstone. Dany can barely be bothered with this, but Tyrion says this dragonglass can apparently kill White Walkers, or something like that. (He seems as annoyed with this oh-so-convenient plot device as many of us are.) Dany’s more interested in whether Tyrion himself believes in the White Walkers and he drops an ancient piece of wisdom — a wise man once said you should never believe something just because you want to believe it. Daenerys busts him: “Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?” Tyrion convinces her that she has nothing to lose by giving Jon the dragonglass; Dany wants to know about the whole “knife in the heart” thing Davos briefly mentioned and Tyrion tries to pass it off as those crazy northerners and their crazy talk.  Later, when Dany tells Jon she’ll allow him to mine for dragonglass, the two seem to have found at least a tenuous truce. Jon wonders if this means that Dany believes him about the undead, but doesn’t get an affirmative response.  [‘Game of Thrones’ killed off one fan favorite but regained another]    Rosabell Laurenti Sellers as Tyene Sand, Hafpor Julius Bjornsson as Gregor Clegane, Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister and Indira Varma as Ellaria Sand in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  Cersei is just as sadistic as ever  Euron Greyjoy takes a victory lap through King’s Landing, being cheered on by the peasants as he drags Yara Greyjoy and Ellaria Sand behind him as prisoners. The whole thing is very arousing to him, but then again this guy seems to be in a constant state of arousal. He gets a full round of applause as he walks into the throne room, where he’s greeted by Cersei on the Iron Throne and presents her with his previously promised gift. He gives her what no other man could give — justice. Ellaria, who knows the rest of her life is going to be unspeakably awful (and that was before spotting the Mountain) spits at Cersei’s feet.  Euron’s intentions are clear — he wants to marry Cersei and take the power that would come with their union. Cersei agrees, but not until the war is won. Euron is feeling good about things, enough to taunt Jaime that he’ll soon be taking his place next to Cersei, on the throne and in the bedroom. He even asks for advice: “Gentle or rough?” before adding something off-color that cannot be printed in a publication like this, unless, that is, it is said by the White House communications director.  Down in the Red Keep, Cersei relishes time with her two Dornish prisoners, Ellaria Sand and the One Sand Snake Who Didn’t Die. And for the next few minutes it’s pure, uncut Cersei. The primo stuff. “I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover’s head,” she tells Ellaria, and goes from there. Crossing Cersei in any way will provoke her; murdering her only daughter gets you the special treatment. Cersei’s first act of revenge against Ellaria — you get the feeling this will be drawn out in an agonizing way — is to kill the Living Sand Snake the same way Ellaria killed Myrcella, a kiss with poison. Cersei plants the kiss of death (and quickly drinks the serum) and explains how Ellaria (chained and gagged mere feet away from her daughter) will watch the slow death that will unfold over the next few days. “Your daughter will die here in this cell and you will be there watching when she dies.”  A little torture and murder gets Cersei hot and bothered, because soon she’s jumping Jaime’s bones and the two of them are back to their passionately incestuous ways. The next morning a toweringly confident Cersei not only doesn’t make Jaime hide when a chambermaid comes knocking to tell her she has a visitor, but also instructs said chambermaid that they’ll need fresh sheets for the bed. (See, this was a funny episode.)    Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister and Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)    Olenna Tyrell has zinged her last zinger  We were all gearing up for a brutal and extended Battle for Casterly Rock, but it never transpired. The Unsullied (led by Grey Worm) invaded and suffered some losses, but had a pretty easy time taking the seat of House Lannister. Why was it so easy? Two reasons: 1. Tyrion sneaked the best fighters into the heart of the city through the sewers that his favorite prostitutes traveled discreetly, and 2. the 10,000-strong Lannister army was just a shell of itself. Grey Worm knew it shouldn’t have been that easy and realized they had sort of been had when he sees the Greyjoy fleet destroying the Unsullied’s ships in the Casterly Rock harbor, basically stranding them and making them a sitting target.  As for those missing Lannister men, they were over in Highgarden, easily overwhelming the Tyrell army and taking the city. You have to give Cersei credit so far, her battle plans have been top-notch. Jaime finds Olenna Tyrell alone in her chambers and she is resigned to her fate.  Olenna does have one last speech in her, admitting she did unspeakable things to protect her family but that they were all necessary. Meanwhile Cersei has done things that Olenna didn’t think were capable of imagining, and that she’s truly a monster. “She’s a disease and I regret my role in spreading it,” she says to Jaime. “You will, too.” (Foreshadowing the popular theory that Jaime will kill his sister?) Jaime will still let Olenna die with some dignity, avoiding the fate of Ellaria and simply downing some poison and being done with it. Jaime pours it into her wine glass and Olenna chugs it down immediately, saying she will hate to die like Jaime’s son before dropping her last bit of revenge on the Lannisters and admitting that she was the one who poisoned Joffrey. “Tell Cersei,” she instructs Jaime. “I want her to know it was me.” Farewell, Queen of Thorns. And farewell to the Tyrells, who seem to be more-or-less eliminated from the world.    Ellie Kendrick as Meera Reed Isaac Hempstead Wright as Bran Stark and Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  Bran returns to Winterfell  Sansa has taken to running things in Winterfell, and rather well. Either that or the people in charge of food and armor are idiots, but command does seem to suit her, as Littlefinger points out. In pure Littlefinger fashion, he wants to get to plotting. And he honestly has the most refreshing take on the Battle of the Seven Kingdoms vs. Battle Against the Army of Dead dilemma. Basically — either we all die, or life will win out. And if the latter happens, what then? He goes on and on about how everyone is an enemy and Sansa must think through every possible series of events and how everything is happening at once and it’s a bit confusing but serves as good preparation for what comes next. And that’s the appearance of Bran Stark.  Sansa and Bran catch up by the weirwood tree and Bran informs his sister that he can never be Lord of Winterfell or lord of anything because he’s the Three-Eyed Raven now. “I don’t know what that means,” says Sansa, speaking for literally every single one of us. “It’s difficult to explain,” says Bran, which at least gives me an out from having to explain it. Short version — he can see everything that’s ever happened, and everything that will happen, but he needs to better harness his powers. Sansa wants to know how he knows all this; Bran says the Three-Eyed Raven taught him. Sansa says, I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven. Before they go full Abbott & Costello, Bran starts to get all mystical and Sansa says she has to, uh, go somewhere else right now.  Jorah is healed  The maester in Oldtown checks out Jorah Mormont with some ancient stethoscope and gives him a clean bill of health. Jorah claims it was the rest and the climate that made him better, which would sound better if he was in rehab and not dying of a flesh-eating, brain-infecting bacteria. He’s off to find Daenerys now.  Jorah’s claims of rest obviously don’t convince the maester, who knows Sam operated on Jorah even though it was strictly forbidden. The maester is impressed and asked how Sam did it; Sam just read the book and followed the instructions. The maester then informs Sam that his next assignment is to put together a Malm bed frame. No, he just has to make copies of some ancient manuscripts and scrolls, because that’s what they do in Oldtown.    Conleth Hill as Varys and Carice Van Houten as Melisandre in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  That weird Melisandre/Varys conversation  As Jon Snow came to Dragonstone, Melisandre was watching alone, from afar, before Varys tracked her down. “I’ve brought ice and fire together,” she says, saying that her work is done. She’s also trying to stay out of the way of Jon Snow and Davos, who both have their issues with her. She’s off to Volantis and Varys thinks that’s a good thing, and that she should not return to Westeros. But her final line to him hints that she has one more part to play in this tale: “I have to die in this strange country, just like you.”  PREVIOUS SEASON 7 RECAPS  Episode 2: “Stormborn”  Episode 1: “Dragonstone”",0
"Two years into a relationship with her boyfriend, actress Vanessa Kirby was shocked to wake up one day and find out she was married to Tom Cruise.  While filming “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” with 56-year-old Cruise last spring, paparazzi caught the co-stars kissing on set and the tabloids went wild.  “Even though the [film] crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, ‘The next wife falls at his feet,'” Kirby, 30, told Marie Claire UK in a new interview. “The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?’ I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t.  “None of it is real,” Kirby added. “To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.”  “The Crown” actress has been dating actor Callum Turner for two years and plans to keep that part of her life private.  “I’ve been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,” Kirby shared. “[Turner is] just completely wonderful and he’s my best friend, so that’s … I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not.”  She added, “If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don’t, then it’s not.”",0

"Stassi Schroeder has apologized for making controversial comments about the #MeToo campaign on her podcast.  “My podcast is an outlet for me to share my unfiltered opinion with my listeners, but on my latest episode, I crossed a line,” she said in a statement she tweeted on Saturday, November 25. “It was irresponsible for me to make generalized statements about a very serious topic, such as sexual harassment, as it is not my place to speak about anyone else’s experiences.”  “I apologize,” she continued. “I will continue to speak my mind on my podcast, but will put more thought behind my dialogue moving forward.”  She also tweeted, “These 24 hours have been sobering: I want to share your stories on my podcast: on either side, being accused of something you didn’t do or being victimized & left helpless. Let’s discuss it all.”  These 24 hours have been sobering: I want to share your stories on my podcast: on either side, being accused of something you didn't do or being victimized & left helpless. Let’s discuss it all. Stassi@juststassi.com — Stassi Schroeder (@stassi) November 26, 2017  As previously reported, the Vanderpump Rules star, 29, referenced victims of sexual assault on her Straight Up With Stassi podcast in a since-deleted episode called “Are We on a Male Witch Hunt?” Schroeder claimed that many victims were originally “willing” to go to hotel rooms and were only speaking out against sexual harassment now because of the “hashtag me too trend.” She also stated that “no one can make me suck someone’s d–k.”  Many listeners were outraged with what they perceived to be insensitive views and took to Twitter to express their disgust. Advertisers — including Rent The Runway, Simple Contacts and Framebridge — also spoke out against Schroeder’s comments and publicly terminated their business relationships with her.  Some fans were not swayed by the reality star’s mea culpa and accused her of apologizing only for the sake of her business.  One fan wrote, “Thanks for the apology but this should have been your FIRST response instead dismissing everyone and retweeting people who were agreeing with your harmful opinions.”  Another wrote, “you’re only backpeddling now because you’ve lost advertisers for your podcast. Too late for apologies, we truly know how you feel. #Victimblaming or #victimshaming is something u won’t understand because it hasn’t happened to you #MeToo.”  “You say this after tweeting that you only deleted the episode because people ‘weren’t ready’ to hear what you had to say?

"CLOSE The Grammy Award winner made the announcement on Twitter in a video co-starring his friend and late night TV host Jimmy Fallon. This will be Justin Timberlake's third halftime performance. USA TODAY  Justin Timberlake needs to apologize to Janet Jackson. He should start apologizing now, with the news that he's confirmed to perform at the 2018 Super Bowl halftime show. He should do so as publicly as possible. And at the very least, he should invite her onstage at the show, to perform a song, or 10.  Those are several demands of the viral #JusticeForJanet hashtag, which emerged following the news of Timberlake's halftime booking. Because, even as Timberlake's career has flourished in the 13 years since ""Nipplegate,"" Jackson's fans haven't forgotten that Timberlake is complicit in the unjust treatment of their icon.  In a moment that’s still painful to watch more than a decade later, Timberlake exposed Jackson's breast during her Super Bowl halftime show in 2004 in front of an audience of 143.6 million viewers. The night was supposed to belong to Jackson, who was the seasoned pop star to Timberlake’s rookie. Jackson had invited the then-rising boy band *NSYNC to open for her Velvet Rope tour in 1998, then lent her vocals to Timberlake’s debut album, Justified, after he went solo.  Considering how Timberlake has molded himself in Michael Jackson’s image from the beginning of his solo career, his Super Bowl cameo was meant to be a reunion with his mentor, a chance for him to pay homage to Janet’s pop legacy.  Timberlake needs to apologize because he played a role in hijacking this legacy, starting with the wardrobe malfunction that barely impacted his career while sending Jackson's into free-fall.  The aftermath of the 'wardrobe malfunction.' (Photo: Elise Amendola, AP)  In the weeks after the “wardrobe malfunction,” a phrase that will be forever linked to Jackson’s humiliation, she became a comedy punchline and was blacklisted by Viacom (which kept her music off MTV, VH1, and radio stations around the country).  There seemed to be no question the incident was Jackson’s fault, down to the media outlets that selectively edited her videotaped apology. “Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident,” she later told Ebony.  And while Timberlake has maintained that the incident was an accident, he hasn't taken responsibility for the part he played. ""I'm frustrated at the whole situation,"" he told reporters the week after the Super Bowl. ""I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And the fact of the matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music.""  Timberlake has apologized further in the years since, telling MTV in 2006 that he ""probably got 10% of the blame,"" and that America is ""unfairly harsh on ethnic people."" Yet, he's still unsure how to address the scandal, bungling an exchange last year when a Twitter follower called on him to ""stop appropriating our music and culture"" and ""apologize to Janet too.”  ""Oh, you sweet soul,"" he responded. ""The more you realize that we are the same, the more we can have a conversation. Bye.”  Timberlake is very much not ""the same."" His privilege hasn't only enabled him to score hit albums and film roles and Oscar nominations and a Super Bowl slot, but also lets him play dumb about his own role in a scandal that, as he previously acknowledged, amounted to America piling on a black woman and shaming her for her sexuality while granting him a free pass.    And Timberlake needs to apologize now, more than ever, considering how the news of his booking comes during a blistering month for women reckoning with sexual humiliation. In the wake of Harvey Weinstein’s downfall, women around the world have continued to share their stories about how men’s inappropriate actions ruined their lives.  Seeing Timberlake invited back to the Super Bowl while Jackson’s career still bears visible scars from the incident is a bitter reminder of which people society punishes more for so-called sexual indiscretions.  CLOSE SI Now co-hosts Maggie Gray and Robin Lundberg discuss the rumors that Justin Timberlake will be the halftime performer during Super Bowl LII.

"The physician who served as Bill Gates’ private doctor in Seattle in the 1990s says the Microsoft founder and vaccine proponent “refused to vaccinate his own children” when they were young.“I don’t know if he had them vaccinated as adults, but I can tell you he point blank refused to vaccinate them as children,” the physician said at a behind closed doors medical symposium in Seattle, adding “They were gorgeous kids, really smart and vivacious, and he said they would be OK as it was, they didn’t need any shots.“The comments caused a stir among physicians at the symposium with claims he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality, according to reports. However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise. Studies prove that the elite do not vaccinate their children. But at the same time they expect the masses to have their children vaccinated.The elite do not vaccinateIn California, the children most likely to be unvaccinated are white and come from the wealthiest families in Los Angeles, according to a recent study.The percentage of kindergartners with state-issued personal belief exemptions doubled from 2007 to 2013, from 1.54% to 3.06%. That’s about 17,000 of the wealthiest children, out of more than half a million, opting out of receiving vaccinations.Vaccine exemption percentages were highest in mostly white, high-income neighborhoods such as Orange County, Santa Barbara and parts of the Bay Area, according to CNN.The study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Heath, looked at more than 6,200 California schools and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners attending private institutions.“Very rich and privileged parents like the idea of herd immunity, but they don’t want to take the risks associated with vaccinations when it comes to their own children. They are worried about adverse reactions including autism.“",0
"Family Feud funnyman Steve Harvey is facing a $400 million divorce bombshell — as his wife walked out because he was getting too close to showbiz pal Kris Jenner!  The love rat TV host, 61, and third wife Marjorie, 53, moved from Atlanta to Los Angeles last year to launch the former stand-up comic’s self-titled talk show.  But according to insiders, Steve’s cozying up to the Kardashian momager during closed-door business meetings, endless phone chats and nonstop text messages has sent Marjorie over the edge.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told Radar.  PHOTOS; Steve Harvey Has Lunch With Kris Jenner’s Beau Corey Gamble  “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Steve and 62-year-old Kris, a two-time divorcée, have been buddy-buddy for years .  They were pictured together during Paris Fashion Week in 2015. They’ve also been seen out in Hollywood on multiple occasions and Kris appeared on his talk show to help boost ratings.  To further cement their relationship, Kris brought her brood to Family Feud.  PHOTOS: You’re Fired! Kim Kardashian & Her Sister Want Momager Kris Jenner Out — 7 Reasons Why  Despite their apparent closeness, a TV insider insisted Kris has “no interest in Steve romantically.”  Instead, crafty Kris is stringing Steve along, hoping to manipulate him into sharing his TV smarts so she can use his advice to boost her own sagging empire.  “Kris is pursuing Steve — but it’s all about business,” the source snitched. “She admires his TV success and wants to learn all his secrets.”  Although Keeping Up with the Kardashians has been a monster hit, the show was created by Ryan Seacrest, and Kris desperately needs guidance to grow her own showbiz brand, according to sources.  PHOTOS: ‘KUWTK’ Fakery Exposed: Kris Jenner’s Evil Manipulations Backfire  “Kris has tried to produce a long list of shows, but they’ve all been disasters,” the source said.  “Meanwhile, Steve has the golden touch when it comes to TV. That’s why Kris is looking to him for professional help.”  Furious over the pair’s closeness, Marjorie got revenge by posting several videos of her working out with her hunky young personal trainer on Instagram.  A few days later, Steve made a spur-of-the-moment decision to treat Marjorie to a no-expense-spared vacation in Europe.  PHOTOS: Say What?! 18 Of Kris Jenner’s Most Outrageous Quotes  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” said a former employee on his talk show, who spoke with Radar on the condition of anonymity.  “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  Steve left his first wife, Marcia, in 1990 while she was pregnant to move in with Mary Shackelford, who became his second wife in 1996.  Before even filing for divorce, Steve ditched Mary in 2005 for Marjorie — and his bitter ex has never forgiven him.  Last year Mary socked Steve with a $60 million lawsuit, claiming he bullied her out of a fortune during their divorce and his cheating triggered a breakdown that landed her in a mental hospital.  Mary’s sister, Ruth Littrell, fumed: “Once a cheater, always a cheater. Steve’s up to his old tricks — it’s nothing new. Marjorie will end up divorcing him and taking him for everything he’s got!”  We pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

"Chris Rock Tweets Controversial Lamar Odom Joke  Yeesh. Chris Rock tweeted a controversial joke about Lamar Odom's recent stay at the Love Ranch South brothel — and subsequent hospitalization — and how the crisis saved his marriage to Khloe Kardashian.  PHOTOS: Khloe and Lamar's wedding album  On Thursday, Oct. 22, Rock, 50, shared a meme with his 3.5 million-plus followers on Twitter of a married couple bickering in their kitchen. The caption of the graphic read, ""Here's to Lamar Odom on being the first guy in history to have coke and hookers save his marriage.""  The comedian, who was also announced as the 2016 Oscars host this week, then added: ""Stay strong Lamar.""  PHOTOS: Khloe's evolution  While some fans found the joke funny, others called it offensive. ""Too soon. shame on you, Rock,"" one person tweeted, while another wrote: ""savage.""  Odom was found unconscious on Tuesday, Oct. 13, at the legal brothel in Pahrump, Nev., where authorities later confirmed that Odom had taken herbal Viagra, and used drugs that Saturday when he first checked in. After the troubled NBA player was first hospitalized, his estranged wife, Kardashian, rushed to be by his side and faced difficult medical decisions on his behalf while he was unconscious for nearly 72 hours.  PHOTOS: Reality TV tragedies  Odom was discharged from Sunrise Hospital this past Monday, and transported via helicopter to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in L.A., where he is currently being monitored by top medical personnel.  Us Weekly confirmed this past Wednesday, Oct. 21, that Kardashian's lawyer Laura Wasser asked a judge to withdraw the couple's divorce filing, which was signed by both parties in July. At the time, the documents were still pending and awaiting the final sign-off from the court. Kris Jenner subsequently confirmed that the divorce was called off. ""Nothing but love,"" the Kardashian family matriarch told her longtime pal Billy Bush.  PHOTOS: Kardashian Christmas cards through the years  While many fans have been ecstatic that Kardashian, 31, and Odom, 35, are giving their marriage a second shot, Rock's Twitter joke, however, may have been posted too soon.

Lamar Odom Overdosed on Cocaine and Other Drugs: Report  Authorities suspect that Lamar Odom overdosed on cocaine and other drugs before he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel earlier this month, the Associated Press reports.  PHOTOS: Khloe's body evolution  The AP obtained search warrant records on Thursday, Oct. 23, that included testimony from Michael Eisenloffel, a Nye County sheriff's detective.  ""I believe that Mr. Odom may be — or may have been — under the influence of a controlled substance,"" Eisenloffel stated.  In addition, Eisenloffel said onlookers claimed that the former NBA star ingested ""an unknown substance in the form of an unidentified pill, which he obtained from his pocket,"" and prostitutes ""heard him snorting.""  PHOTOS: Khloe and Lamar's wedding album  TMZ reported on Thursday that Khloe Kardashian's husband, 35 — the pair have decided to dismiss their divorce case — underwent two emergency surgeries at L.A.'s Cedars-Sinai Hospital.

Dr. Drew Talks Teen Mom 2's Leah Messer: ""I Was Expecting Progress""  Following reports that Leah Messer lost primary custody of her twins, Ali and Aleeah, Dr. Drew Pinsky, who moderates the Teen Mom 2 reunion specials, spoke out about the West Virginia native.  PHOTOS: Leah Messer's family album  Admitting he could not confirm the reports, the addiction specialist, 57, spoke about Messer in a backstage interview on The Rachael Ray Show.  “She is a dedicated mother,” he said. “If you saw the last reunion show, which is the last time I had contact with her, I believed she was making some progress.”  PHOTOS: Teen Mom stars, then and now  Though the reunion special, which was taped in July and aired earlier this month, featured a tense confrontation between Messer and her ex-husband Corey Simms and his wife, Miranda, Dr. Drew didn’t think that was cause for concern.  “People around her were starting to really come down on her,” he noted. “When that starts to happen, that’s a real sign that the identified patient — whatever her condition is, mental health issue — is getting better. When somebody is aware enough that the people who have been so worried and frustrated around them can actually hear them that’s when they come down on them. So I told Leah that I thought that was a good sign and she should learn to tolerate it.”  PHOTOS: Stars battling mental health issues  The custody battle between Messer and Simms, which has been closely documented on Teen Mom 2, was ugly throughout Season 6. Simms accused his ex-wife of having a pill addiction and endangering their daughters. (Messer is also mom to daughter Addie with her ex-husband Jeremy Calvert.)  Messer has never admitted to a drug addiction and passed a court-ordered drug test on the show. In June she went to a rehabilitation facility for 30 days for treatment for depression. On the reunion special, Dr. Drew also alluded to the fact that Messer’s mental illness had led to a previously undisclosed hospitalization.  PHOTOS: Stars who have been to rehab  “I was expecting progress,” Dr. Drew said on Rachael Ray. “I certainly wish her the best. She is working very hard. It’s been a terribly painful and stressful time for her.”  Neither Messer nor Simms have confirmed the reports about the new custody arrangement.

Caitlyn Jenner Wears Kate Middleton's Engagement Dress: Who Wore It Best  There are some fashion moments we'll remember forever. One of them happens to be the navy blue Issa London wrap dress that Kate Middleton wore for her engagement announcement to Prince William.  PHOTOS: The royal wedding album  Back in 2010, the Duchess of Cambridge, now 33, paired the shiny V-neck frock with a dainty necklace, sensible black pumps, and, of course, her matching sapphire engagement ring. With the ""Kate Effect"" in full swing, the dress reportedly sold out within 24 hours of her wearing it.  PHOTOS: Kate Middleton's recycled dresses  However, it's clearly back in stock. On Wednesday, Oct. 21, the Issa London ""Phylis"" style resurfaced in L.A. on Caitlyn Jenner. The I Am Cait star, 65, whose own style is focused on ladylike wrap dresses and cozy sweaters, took a cue from Middleton, pairing her version of the knee-length number with similar black heels, this time in a sling-back style. Jenner carried a matching black handbag, and accessorized with simple stud earrings and a chain-link bracelet. The only difference between the two dresses is that the former Olympian wore the wrapped ties as a bow in the front, while Middleton tied her dress in the back.

The physician passed away from natural causes in Palm Springs, Fla., on Thursday, Oct. 22. He was 70.  PHOTOS: Stars gone too soon  According to TMZ, Klein admitted himself into a hospital earlier this week when he was feeling abdominal pains. He was wheelchair-bound and also suffered from multiple sclerosis.  The L.A.-based dermatologist treated the late Jackson for several years until the legendary singer's death in 2009. Over time, he's continued to dodge questions of rumors that he's the biological father of Jackson's two oldest children, Prince, 18, and Paris, 17.  Back in 2009, Klein admitted during Larry King Live that he once donated sperm, but only to a bank. ""Here's the most important thing. Michael loved those children. Those children loved him as a father,"" he told King at the time. ""As far as I am concerned, that's the most important grouping there is.""  PHOTOS: Celebrity deaths 2015  ""That's not answering the question,"" King replied. Klein quipped back: ""No, because I'm not going to answer it the way you want me to answer it because…I will say no if that's what you want to hear."" (Klein has never denied that he's the dad.)  Story is still developing.  Kate Middleton, Prince William Spend Night Where They First Met  Back when they were two young undergrads, Kate Middleton and Prince William met and fell in love at the University of St. Andrews in Fife, Scotland. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took a trip down memory lane on Thursday, Oct. 22, staying at the five-star Old Course Hotel where they enjoyed a romantic date night away from the kids.  PHOTOS: Kate and William's childhood pics  “The Duke and Duchess spent last night in St Andrews, where they first met @univofstandrews,” the official Kensington Palace Twitter handle tweeted on Friday with a throwback photo of the young lovebirds.

Rooms at the fancy hotel start at $470 per night and it overlooks the West Sands beach and the Scottish coastline.  PHOTOS: Meet Princess Charlotte  The next day the pair visited Dundee, Scotland, for an eventful day. After greeting the massive crowds outside of the Dundee Repertory Theatre, they joined Prince Harry to support the Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival.  Middleton, 33, wore a custom Christopher Kane blue coat and kilt paired with her go-to Aquatalia boots, while her husband, also 33, wore a navy suit with a red tie.  PHOTOS: Prince George's baby album  At the theatre, the mother of Prince George and Princess Charlotte was intrigued by an 8-year-old girl named Evie Will who was wearing a mask of Queen Elizabeth.  “Where did you find that?” she asked the little girl, laughing.  Little Evie later opened up to Us Weekly and other reporters about meeting Prince William, saying, “He was asking me what I like at school and what productions I have seen at the theatre, and I said I like maths and I've seen James and the Giant Peach and the BFG. He said that he didn't like maths. It was cool to meet them, but I was kind of scared.""  PHOTOS: Kate Middleton's recycled outfits  One well-wisher asked the Duchess if William was still a fan of his motorbike.  ""He's still riding it,” she replied. “It always fills me with horror when he goes out on it. I'm terrified… ? Hopefully, I'm going to keep George off it.""  Amanda Lowsen, the Community and Wellbeing Facilitator at the theatre, noted of the Royals, ""They were very relaxed. A lot of the mums were saying it's great to come to something all together as a family and they were nodding and seemed to understand that.""  William and Kate later visited The Corner, a drop-in center for teens wanting advice on issues like contraception or exam stress, and then joined in an anti-bullying workshop organized by Scottish organization, RespectMe.  Mila Kunis: I'd Bury a Body for My Baby Daughter Wyatt  Too funny! Mila Kunis loves her baby girl, Wyatt, so much that she would personally help bury the body if her daughter killed someone, the actress said on Thursday, Oct. 22.  “I think if she killed someone, I would literally be like, ‘I got it,’” Kunis, 32, told Business Insider of her 12-month-old daughter. “‘Where do you want me to bury the body?’ I wouldn’t even question it. I can’t say that about anybody else in my life.”  PHOTOS: Mila's pregnancy style  Kunis, who married Ashton Kutcher this past July, shared additional details about how motherhood has changed her.  PHOTOS: Ashton and Mila's romance  “Everything is different,” the Black Swan actress noted. “From the fact that you’re so happy when you get six hours of sleep to the idea of being responsible for this incredible, living breathing little human being that you can’t believe is yours,” she gushed.  PHOTOS: Mila's sexy transformation  Kunis also said that she brings baby Wyatt to work with her every day. “I’m super lucky that I could work from home, so to speak,” she said. “My office is downstairs. There’s coming a point in her little life where all my attention can’t always go to her.”  Kutcher, 37, and Kunis welcomed their little one last October. The actress also reflected on the possibility of having more children down the road.  “I mean, not today,” the Jupiter Ascending star revealed. “I’m not pregnant. But yeah, absolutely, for sure!”  Kim K. Reminisces About Birthday Engagement: ""Best Surprise Ever!""  Sigh, memories.

"It’s over. Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago have split after less than four years of marriage, Us Weekly can confirm.  According to E! News, the Polish-American model, 38, and the handsome entrepreneur have been separated since December. “They just grew apart,” a source told the outlet.  The former couple’s often rocky romance was featured on Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Miami, which ended after three seasons in 2013. Though they once called off their engagement after an explosive fight over cheating rumors, they eventually tied the knot in June 2013. The romantic California ceremony, which Krupa’s rep described to Us Weekly as “a million-dollar princess wedding,” was featured on the reality series.  Months after getting hitched, Krupa told Us that she wanted to start a family with Zago, and revealed that she had thought about freezing her eggs.  “We’re talking more and more about it. Honestly, [one second] I want to have a baby and [then] another second I don’t feel like I’m ready for it just yet. So what I think I’m gonna do — unless it happens naturally — I think I’m gonna freeze my eggs in the next month or two,” she shared with Us during a January 2014 interview. “I wish I did that in my twenties but, unfortunately, I didn’t. So I think I’m gonna do it just in case because every year I’m like, ‘This is the year, this is the year.’ But I’m still focused on other things that it’s just really hard, and I don’t want to take it away from being a mother.”  Aside from her dream of becoming a mother, the blonde beauty — who lives in Los Angeles — also opened up to Us about the challenges of maintaining a bi-coastal marriage with Zago, who is based in Miami. “We both have such busy lives. The Real Housewives of Miami only shows my life in Miami and, to be honest, my life is more L.A. The only thing that keeps me in Miami is my husband,” she said. “… I think we’re like the only couple that’s been doing a bi-coastal relationship for seven years.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer‘s feud fueled most of the action in season 9 of The Real Housewives of New York City — stemming from the moment Singer made the mistake of bringing up Frankel’s naked film past in the context of her 7-year-old daughter Bryn.  From there, it was one fight after the next — each time Singer attempting to apologize only to dig a deeper and deeper hole for herself by insulting Frankel again and again.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  First there was a chat in a restaurant during a group holiday party, where Singer attempted a more polite approach but got vicious when Frankel calmly told her “I don’t want to be schooled by you right now and I don’t like the way you’re speaking to me.” Then there was Singer’s Berkshires blowout — where she criticized everything from Frankel’s Skinnygirl empire to her relationship status to the real way she allegedly made her millions (sample: “You didn’t have any money until you f—–. You would date every guy for their f—— money”).  It only got worse when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation — causing Singer to launch into an emotional tirade about her divorce. “My f—— heart was cut out, my legs, my arms,” Singer said, tearing up. “So don’t even tell me and try to compare your life to mine. Don’t. Don’t. Just don’t, Bethenny. Have more respect for me. Have more respect and more sympathy. It’s not always about you.”  Bethenny Frankel Bravo  Ramona Singer Bravo  Eventually the two would make a pact to drop the nasty comments. And during a tequila-filled trip to Mexico, the two would come to peace — having a heart-to-heart on pool floats while the Skinnygirl mogul skinny-dipped.  “I’m f—ed up, okay? I’m f—ed up,” Singer said. “I’m a miserable person, I’m horrible, I’m a bad friend, I don’t know how to act. I am so sorry that I did what I did and I hurt you. I’ll never do that again. … I don’t want to be that person. I care about you and I don’t want to hurt you or anyone else I care about.”  “That s— has to stop. You be a good friend. Who does that? Who acts like that?” Frankel told her in response. “I don’t want you to be that person. I know you don’t know. You’re not bad — you’re not an evil person. … I want you to be happy. I really do, I swear to God on my life I want you to be happy.”  Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo  So where does Frankel and Singer’s friendship stand now?  On Wednesday’s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle. And after exchanging another round of blows, they appeared to settle back into a truce — even hugging at the end.  “The thing was all season, I just wanted you to be out of my way,” Frankel told Singer. “I’m not angry at you — I knew you had such anxiety coming in here. I don’t feel anger towards you. But do I need to be your best friend? No.”  “I don’t want to be close, but I don’t not not like you is where I am with you,” she said, quoting Singer’s iconic “I don’t not not like you” from earlier in the season. “I’m not angry with you, I honestly wish you happiness.”  Her words resonated with Singer. “I feel it from you. I’m honestly happy we’re in this place. I really feel better,” she said, as host Andy Cohen pointed out the two weren’t in that good of a place. “At least [Bethenny’s] talking to me. She’s not icing me out. So for me, that’s good!”  Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo  Singer spent a lot of time Wednesday apologizing for her actions — even admitting that she “cringed” when she watched back some of her arguments with the upcoming Shark Tank investor.  “It was blind range,” she said of her behavior in the Berkshires. “I was so angry, it was blind range.”  She was also blind drunk too. “I had a few too many,” Singer admitted, balking down questions from Cohen that she was also on pills. “I wasn’t on pills, I was just drinking all day because being around her was making me nervous. I don’t take Xanax.”  “Looking back, I looked like an a——. I don’t know what I was thinking the whole damn season,” Singer added. “I just lost my whole mojo for weeks on end because Bethenny was so upset with me — which I can understand in retrospect. But I just didn’t know how to make it right and it just got worse. And it was just a horrible moment in my life.”  Ramona Singer, Sonja Morgan, Dorinda Medley and Luann D'Agostino Bravo  Still, despite “owning” her bad behavior, Singer remained steadfast that her original question about Frankel’s naked-film past was innocent.  “My delivery sucked at that lunch. [But] it was not coming out of viciousness, it was not coming out of maliciousness,” Singer said, explaining that she had been sent the article from a friend a week before talking with Frankel about it.  “My first concern in the back of my head was remembering that [former New York City Housewife] Alex McCord had a naked picture in one of the weeklies [in season 1],” Singer recalled. “And [my daughter Avery’s] school was upset, she was almost asked to leave. … I was like, ‘Oh my God, I hope everything’s okay with Bryn. I hope no one’s saying anything.’ “  Bethenny Frankel, Andy Cohen, and Ramona Singer Bravo  FROM PEN: Andy Cohen’s Pick For The Most Absurd Real Housewives’ Business Ever  Frankel didn’t buy it. “The article brought up something that had already been in the press years ago and I wrote in a book had come out six weeks before,” she told Singer. “So when you came to that very intimate time to speak to me mother-to-mother in a very public restaurant and bring me this smoking gun, it wasn’t that it was the delivery. It was the content, it was the intention — it was malicious.”  “I was going through a bad situation in my personal life and despite that, I didn’t come at you at all,” Frankel continued, looking back at their season of blows. “Not one time did I attack you. You attacked my entire career and insinuated I slept my way to I don’t know where, but I never attacked you not one time, Ramona. …You’ve been disgusting to me.”  RHONY REWIND: Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Fight on the Brooklyn Bridge  The two continued to go back and forth — Frankel bringing up past arguments (the Brooklyn Bridge!) and Singer maintaining that she was always a good friend (“I’ve been so there for you on so many levels”).  But in the end, none of that mattered as the two decided to put down their (metaphorical) guns and focus on moving on.  ‘Til next season …",0
"Jennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969) is an American singer, actress, dancer and producer. In 1991, Lopez began appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in the 1997 Selena biopic of the same name, Lopez received a Golden Globe nomination and became the first Latin actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in Anaconda (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), later establishing herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.[3]  Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album On the 6 (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music. With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album This Is Me... Then, and appeared in Maid in Manhattan.  After starring in Gigli (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez subsequently starred in the successful romantic comedies Shall We Dance? (2004) and Monster-in-Law (2005). Her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following an unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on American Idol, and released her seventh studio album Love?. In 2016, she began starring in the crime drama series Shades of Blue and commenced a residency show, Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. Since 2017, Lopez has produced and served as a judge on World of Dance.  With a cumulative film gross of US$2.9 billion and estimated global sales of 80 million records, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Latin performer in the United States. In 2012, Forbes ranked her as the most powerful celebrity in the world, as well as the 38th most powerful woman in the world.[4] Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 include: ""If You Had My Love"", ""I'm Real"", ""Ain't It Funny"", ""All I Have"", and ""On the Floor"", which is one of the best-selling singles of all time.[5] For her contributions to the music industry, Lopez has received a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Billboard Icon Award and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award among other honors. Her other ventures include clothing lines, fragrances, a production company, and a charitable foundation. She has been divorced three times and gave birth to twins in 2008 with then-husband Marc Anthony.  Early life  Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969, in The Bronx borough of New York City, to Puerto Rican parents Guadalupe Rodríguez and David López.[6] She has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, Lynda, a journalist.[7] David worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while Guadalupe was a homemaker. When Lopez was born, the family was living in a small apartment in the Castle Hill neighborhood. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.[8] At the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old. Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home—singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay ""out of trouble"".[9] Lopez spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at Preston High School.[10] In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level, and was a member of the school's softball team.[11] She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships.[9]  While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman.[12] Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a ""famous movie star"". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in Baruch College, only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents about her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a ""really stupid"" idea and that ""no Latinos did that"". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma!. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a Golden Musicals of Broadway, which toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. She later got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer, and choreographer.[8]  Career  1991–1996: Career beginnings  Lopez was selected as a backup dancer for the New Kids on the Block in 1991 and performed with them during their performance of ""Games"" at the 18th Annual American Music Awards.[13] Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television program In Living Color. She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unable to continue with the show. Out of 2,000 applicants, Lopez made it to the finals. She was the runner-up but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved to Los Angeles to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993, when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist Janet Jackson.[14] Lopez was set to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but backed out as she wanted to do her ""own thing"".[15]  Lopez received her first professional acting gig in the direct-to-video drama film Lost in the Wild (1993), co-starring with Lindsay Wagner and Robert Loggia.[16] Later in 1993, Lopez signed a deal with CBS to co-star in the television series Second Chances. Lopez received her first major big-screen role in Gregory Nava's 1995 drama My Family portraying Young Maria.[17] Although her role was uncredited, Lopez received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for her performance.[17] In November 1995, Lopez starred in Money Train alongside Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson as New York City transit cops. In August 1996, Lopez had a supporting role in the comedy Jack.[18]  1997–1999: Breakthrough with Selena and On the 6  In February 1997, Lopez starred alongside Jack Nicholson and Stephen Dorff in the neo-noir thriller Blood and Wine.[19] Lopez starred as the title role of the Selena biopic of the same name in March.[20] Despite having previously worked with the film's director on My Family, Lopez was subjected to an intense auditioning process before she was cast in the film.[21] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that even in the ""forgettable films"" Money Train, and Jack, Lopez's ""presence and ability made her seem just one role away from stardom"" and with Selena she's ""seized the opportunity and turned in an incandescent presentation that is especially strong during the film's numerous musical numbers"". He concluded by calling the film not just a celebration of Selena's life, but also of the actress who portrayed her.[22] The announcement was described as the ""role of a lifetime."" from news outlets and Lopez's salary for the film was reported at $1 million,[23][24] which made Lopez the highest-paid Hispanic actress in history. After filming Selena, Lopez was ""really feeling [her] Latin roots"" and cut a demo in Spanish.[25] Lopez's manager then sent the song, titled ""Vivir Sin Ti"" (Living without You), to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead.[26]  In April, Lopez starred in the horror film Anaconda alongside Ice Cube and Jon Voight.[27] Lopez starred alongside Sean Penn and Billy Bob Thornton in the crime film U Turn in October. The film, which is based on the novel Stray Dogs by John Ridley, received somewhat positive reviews from critics.[28] In June, Lopez starred opposite George Clooney in Out of Sight, Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name (1996).[29] Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal, Lopez won rave reviews for her performance.[30] Lopez provided the voice of Azteca in the computer-animated film Antz in October.[31]  Lopez's debut single, ""If You Had My Love"", was released in May 1999, as she began to ready her first album.[32][33] Lopez became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with a debut single since Britney Spears did so with her single ""...Baby One More Time"" four months prior.[34] During production of her debut album, On the 6, Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the basis of her looks and an already established name in the entertainment industry, and she wanted to prove she had musical talent.[35] Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: ""If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.""[36] ""Waiting for Tonight"", the third single from On the 6, is widely considered to be Lopez's best song.[37] Lopez's musical success came as a surprise to critics; its launch made the ""popular actor even more popular"". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by ""this woman who seemed to have so many different talents"".[36] By the end of 1999, Lopez successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.[38] She joined a select few in achieving this feat, becoming the first since Vanessa Williams (1992) and Martika (1989).[34]  2000–2002: Film success, J.Lo and This Is Me... Then  On February 23, 2000, Lopez, accompanied by then boyfriend Sean Combs, wore a plunging exotic green Versace silk chiffon dress on the red carpet of the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards. The dress ""had a low-cut neck that extended several inches below her navel, where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again,"" exposing her midriff and then as cut along the front of the legs like a bath robe.[39] The dress generated controversy and media attention, with images of Lopez in the dress being downloaded from the Grammy website over half a million times 24 hours after the event.[40] Lopez was surprised by the enormous media coverage, declaring that she had no idea ""it was going to become such a big deal"".[41] Lopez returned to the big-screen in August, starring in the psychological thriller The Cell opposite Vincent D'Onofrio.[42]  During the process of recording her second album, Lopez decided to tweak her image as she began to develop into a sex symbol. She started going by J.Lo, something fans often called her.[43] She subsequently named the album J.Lo. Released on January 23, 2001, it was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200.[44] During the same week, her romantic comedy film The Wedding Planner in which she starred opposite Matthew McConaughey opened atop the box office. This made her the first woman to have a number one film and album simultaneously in the United States.[45] The album was preceded by the release of its lead single, ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"", which reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. It was followed by the single ""Play"".[46] In April 2001, Lopez launched J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez, her own clothing and accessory company. Lopez felt that ""the voluptuous woman [was] almost ignored"" in the fashion industry, and therefore her company specialized in clothing women of all shapes.[43] The following month, she starred in the romantic drama film Angel Eyes, which performed disappointingly at the box office and generated mixed reviews.[47] After several months, J.Lo was declining on the charts; this prompted Mottola to recruit rapper Ja Rule to create an urban-oriented remix of the song ""I'm Real"". This led to the release of ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"", which quickly reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Its success resulted in J.Lo being reissued to include the single, which was number one in the United States during the week of the September 11 attacks.[46] J.Lo became the best-selling album of Lopez's career, having sold 3.8 million copies in the US and moved over 12 million units worldwide.[48][49]  Having redefined Lopez's sound with ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"", Epic decided to release further remixes in order to ""keep the momentum going"".[50] A remix album entitled J to tha L–O! The Remixes was subsequently released on February 5, 2002. It debuted at the summit of the Billboard 200, making it the first remix album to do so. Its lead single, ""Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)"", featuring Ja Rule and Caddillac Tah, reached number one in the US.[51] J to tha L–O! The Remixes became one of the best-selling remix albums of all time, selling 1.5 million copies in the US.[52] It produced two more singles: ""I'm Gonna Be Alright"" and ""Alive"", a ballad co-written by her husband at the time, Cris Judd. In April 2002, Lopez opened her restaurant, Madrè's.[43] The following month, she starred in the thriller film Enough, which was described by the Boston Herald as a ""kick-but, female empowerment"" film.[53] While filming Enough, which required an overworked Lopez to practice Krav Maga, she suffered a nervous breakdown. She recalled feeling ""sick and weird"", refusing therapeutic help or medication. She confessed, ""I was like – I don't want to move, I don't want to talk, I don't want to do anything.""[54] In September, she released her first fragrance, Glow by JLo. It performed strongly despite predictions that it would fail, and became the top-selling fragrance in the US.[55]  Lopez's third studio album, This Is Me... Then, was released on November 25, 2002. It was dedicated to actor Ben Affleck, her fiancé at the time. The album's lead single ""Jenny from the Block"", was later described by Sam Lansky of MTV News as her most iconic single.[56] In the song, Lopez ""intones her modest childhood roots"".[57] The album itself performed strongly, selling 2.6 million copies in the US.[52] Its second single, ""All I Have"", peaked at number one in the US. That December, Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes in the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan, which became the highest-grossing film of her career.[58]  2003–2005: Gigli and Rebirth  In August 2003, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli. The film was a box office bomb, and is considered one of the worst films of all time. The film's poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release, as well as the media attention surrounding Lopez and Affleck's engagement which largely overshadowed the film.[58][59] Lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career, saying ""[It] was very tough"", ""the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment.""[60] In October of that year, she released her next fragrance, Still Jennifer Lopez. Lopez also launched her next fashion label, Sweetface. It was described by Andy Hilfiger as a ""more intellectual, more inspirational collection than J-Lo by Jennifer Lopez. Less sporty, more suede.""[61] Lopez's clothing lines and two fragrances generated over $300 million in revenue throughout 2004, which made her the 19th richest person under 40.[45]  In March 2004, Lopez had a minor role in the film Jersey Girl, alongside Affleck. Her character, Gertrude Steiney, dies during childbirth within the first 15 minutes of the film. From the intense media scrutiny following the couple's break-up, it was noted that ""they may need to put Lopez in a coffin on the poster if they want anyone to come"".[62] In October, Lopez co-starred alongside Richard Gere in the drama Shall We Dance?, a re-make of the 1996 Japanese film of the same title. The film was successful at the box office, and was considered a rebound for Lopez following Gigli.[58]  After placing her career on hiatus, Lopez released her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in February 2005. According to Lopez, Rebirth ""came about because I was on such a roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, and I did a bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [when] I came back, this was the first project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for me, like I was, in a way, reborn.""[63] Tracy Hopkins of NBC's Today Music noted that after ""fawning"" over Affleck on This Is Me... Then"", Lopez ""wisely keeps her love life out of the spotlight"" on Rebirth and only references her relationship with Anthony on a few tracks.[64] The album produced the single ""Get Right"", which peaked at number one in the United Kingdom.[65] In May, she starred alongside Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law, for which she received a salary of $15 million.[66] The film's marketing played up Lopez's ""Gigli-and-tabloid tarnished image"", and it became a box office success.[58][67] In August, Lopez starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in An Unfinished Life, a drama film based on the novel of the same name.  2006–2009: Career disappointments and Como Ama una Mujer  Lopez in 2008  In April 2006, Lopez reappeared on the Billboard Hot 100 as a featured artist on ""Control Myself"", the lead single from LL Cool J's twelfth studio album Todd Smith. The song peaked at number four on the chart following its release as a music download, making it the pair's second collaboration to reach the top five.[68] Bordertown, a film based on the Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, made its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2006. Lopez, who also acts as the film's producer, stars as Lauren Adrian, an American news reporter for the Chicago Sentinel who wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war.[69] Bordertown received a direct-to-video release.[58] DanceLife, a reality series following the lives of seven dancers trying to break into the world of professional dance, aired on MTV from January 15 to March 5, 2007. Lopez produced, created and was featured in the show.[70] According to the album's co-producer Estéfano, Lopez's fifth studio album Como Ama una Mujer would ""prove critics wrong"" with its ""big songs that require a voice""; referring to the criticism of Lopez having a ""limited"" vocal tone. The album's lead single ""Qué Hiciste"" reached number one on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart. Lopez performed the song on the sixth season of American Idol on April 11, 2007, becoming the first person to perform a Spanish song on the series.[65] The album received the highest first-week sales in the United States for a debut Spanish album and the highest digital sales.[73][74]  In September 2007, Lopez starred in the biographical film El Cantante, which is based on the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe. In the film, Lavoe is portrayed by then-husband Marc Anthony while Lopez plays Lavoe's wife Puchi.[75] Lopez revealed that she felt her performance in the film El Cantante should have earned her an Oscar.[76] ""I feel like I had that [Oscar worthy role] in 'El Cantante,' but I don't think the academy members saw it"".[76] El Cantante did not perform well at the box office, earning just $7.6 million.[58] Lopez and Anthony also launched their co-headlining North American concert tour on September 28.[77] Lopez's sixth studio album Brave, released in October, was her lowest-charting album worldwide.[78] The album produced two singles, ""Do It Well"" and ""Hold It Don't Drop It"". The first peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the latter failed to make any significant impact on the charts. A five-part miniseries, Jennifer Lopez Presents: Como Ama una Mujer, based on the lyrics of Como Ama una Mujer aired on Univision from October 30 to November 27, 2007. She placed her career on hiatus after giving birth to twins in February 2008.[79] In late 2009, Lopez released two songs for her seventh studio album, Love? (""Louboutins"" and ""Fresh Out of the Oven""); however, the songs failed to make an appearance on the Billboard charts which led to her departure from Epic Records.[80]  2010–2012: Career rejuvenation with American Idol and touring  Lopez parted ways with Epic Records in February 2010, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release her seventh studio album Love? under a new label.[81] Her departure from the label temporarily halted production on the album, which commenced in 2009. Upon signing a new contract with Island Records, recording resumed on the album.[82] The New York Daily News revealed that Lopez would be taking some of the records recorded under Sony Music Entertainment to her new label so that they could be included on the album.[83] In April, Lopez starred in the romantic comedy The Back-up Plan, her first theatrical role in three years.[79] In June, following the departure of Ellen DeGeneres from American Idol, it was reported that Lopez was in talks to join season ten's judging panel.[84][85][86] During this same time, Lopez and Anthony were being considered for a role on The X Factor for their appeal to Latin and International markets.[87] It was officially announced in September that Lopez would be joining the tenth season of American Idol. MTV stated that the deal was ""mutually beneficial to all those involved"", while CNN reported that Lopez was viewing it as a decision to revive her career, while American Idol producers believed that Lopez and Steven Tyler's appointments would strengthen viewing figures.[88] In October, Lopez released her fourteenth fragrance, Love and Glamour. The perfume was inspired by Lopez's forthcoming ""return to the spotlight"".[89]  L'Oreal Paris named Lopez their new Global Ambassador and the face of their brands, including EverPure hair care, Preference hair color and Youth Code skin care. Her EverSleek hair care ads made their debut in early 2011, to coincide with the release of Love? and her debut as a judge on American Idol.[90] To further promote her comeback, in February, Venus chose Lopez as their new Global Ambassador.[91] Lopez's comeback single ""On the Floor"" was released later that same month. The song topped the charts across the globe, becoming one of the most successful singles of the year.[92] The song also became her highest charting single commercially as a lead artist, as well as her most successful airplay hit on contemporary hit radio, since ""Jenny from the Block"".[93] Love?, which was released in May, was a moderate commercial success, and was viewed as a humble comeback from Lopez, as many had considered her recording career over.[78] Lopez launched her next fragrance Love and Light in July, exclusively on HSN. 51,000 bottles of the fragrance were sold at its premiere, becoming Lopez's most successful fragrance launch to date, making over $2.9 million.[94] In September, Lopez launched the Jennifer Lopez Collection, a clothing and accessories line for Kohl's with Tommy Hilfiger.[95] In addition to the clothing line, she also launched the Jennifer Lopez Home Collection, featuring bedding, towels and luggage.[96] Later that same month Fiat, an Italian automobile manufacturer, enlisted Lopez to promote their products, including the 2012 Fiat 500 Cabrio.

On May 18, Lopez returned to the big screen starring alongside an ensemble cast consisting of Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks, Matthew Morrison and Dennis Quaid in the film What to Expect When You're Expecting, which is based on the novel of the same name.[101] In late May, Lopez released her fragrance Glowing by JLo, which she described as an ""evolution"" of Glow by JLo.[102]  Lopez launched the Dance Again World Tour, her first headlining concert tour, on June 14.[103] It was a lucrative, grossing over $1 million per show.[104] On July 12, she launched Teeology, a luxury T-shirt e-commerce.[105] Lopez voiced Shira, a saber tooth tiger, in the animated film, Ice Age: Continental Drift, the fourth film in the Ice Age franchise.[106] The film became her highest opening weekend figure.[107]  Lopez's first greatest hits album, Dance Again... the Hits, was released on July 24, 2012 in the United States.[108] It was released by Epic Records, as Lopez owed them one final album to end her contract, despite previously announcing that she had fulfilled her contract with the label.[109] Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Anthony and the ""breakup of a family"", felt as if the album's sole single, ""Dance Again"", had come to her at the ""perfect moment"".[110][111] ""Dance Again"" and ""Goin' In"", a single from the soundtrack of the dance film Step Up Revolution, both reached the top of the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs, giving Lopez her twelfth and thirteenth number one on that chart, respectively.[112] nuvoTV announced in September its premier partnership with Lopez, that will see her work on the creative side of the network, managing marketing and program production with her production company, Nuyorican Productions, as well as periodically appearing in network programming.[113][114]  2013–2015: Television ventures and A.K.A.

Bennifer became a popular term, which was eventually entered into urban dictionaries and neologism dictionaries as notable,[182] as the name blend started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of their first names.[183] The couple postponed their nuptials indefinitely a day prior to the planned ceremony in September 2003, citing the media's interference with the event as the reason.[184]  Anthony and Lopez, 2006  Following her break-up with Affleck in January 2004, Lopez began dating her longtime friend, Marc Anthony (real name: Marco Antonio Muñiz). The couple wed that June,[185][186] and lived in Brookville, New York.[187] Two men attempted to ransom a private wedding video that was stolen from the couple for one million dollars; however, they were arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of conspiracy, attempted grand larceny and possession of stolen property.[188] On November 7, 2007, during the final night of their co-headlining tour, Lopez and Anthony officially confirmed that they were expecting their first child.[189] The announcement ended months of speculation over the pregnancy.[190] Her father confirmed that the couple were expecting twins, revealing that it runs in the family: ""My sister also had twins, so it's a hereditary thing.""[191] Lopez, who is a Roman Catholic, has stated that her faith discouraged her from pursuing in vitro fertilization treatment while trying to get pregnant.[192]  Lopez gave birth to a son, Maximilian David, and a daughter, Emme Maribel, in Long Island, New York, on February 22, 2008.[193][194] The twins were introduced in the March 11, 2008, issue of People, for which the magazine paid a reported $6 million; the photographs of the twins became the most expensive celebrity picture ever taken at the time.[195] Three years later in July 2011, the couple announced their split, with Anthony filing for divorce in April 2012.[196] Their divorce was finalized on June 16, 2014, with Lopez retaining primary physical custody of the two children.[197] On December 31, 2014, she legally changed her name back to Jennifer Lopez, dropping Anthony's last name (Muñiz).[198][199]  Lopez had an on-off relationship with her former backup dancer Casper Smart from October 2011 to August 2016.[200][201] In February 2017, she began dating former New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez.[202][203]  In March 2018, Lopez opened up about her own Me Too movement story of being sexually harassed by a director early on in her career, when she was asked to take her top off during one of her first films.[204][205] Lopez has also been an active advocate for the Time's Up movement.[206]  Philanthropy and political activism  Following the September 11 attacks, Lopez was heavily involved in charitable activities. Joining various other artists, she was featured on charitable singles such as ""What's Going On"" and ""El Ultimo Adios (The Last Goodbye)"", which benefited people affected by the tragedy.[207][208] One dollar from each ticket sold at Lopez and Anthony's co-headlining North American concert tour, which grossed an estimated $10 million, was donated to Run for Something Better—a charitable organization supporting physical fitness programs for children.[77][209] In February 2007, Lopez was honored with the Artists for Amnesty prize by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, for her work in the film Bordertown, which shed light on the hundreds of female homicides in Ciudad Juárez. Lopez described it as ""one of the world's most shocking and disturbing, underreported crimes against humanity.""[210][211]  In 2009, Lopez launched the Lopez Family Foundation (originally known as the Maribel Foundation) alongside her sister, Lynda. The nonprofit organization seeks to increase the availability of healthcare for underprivileged women and children, offering a telemedicine program supported by a partnership with the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The foundation has led to the expansion of medical facilities in Panama and Puerto Rico, and created the Center for a Healthy Childhood at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.[212][213]  In December 2012, Lopez held a charity drive that would affect her three favorite charities: the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club, the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles as well as the American Red Cross, mainly benefiting victims of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of her home town, New York City.[214] In May 2015, she became the first national celebrity spokesperson for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and the BC Children's Hospital Foundation (BCCHF), appearing in a campaign entitled ""Put Your Money Where the Miracles Are"".[215] That September, Lopez was announced as the first Global Advocate for Girls and Women at the United Nations Foundation.[216] This role sees her mobilizing action to address challenges faced by girls and women around the world, including maternal health care programs, education and violence against women.[217] In September 2017, following Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, Lopez announced that she would be donating $1 million from the proceeds of her Las Vegas residency to humanitarian aid for Puerto Rico.[218][219] Along with ex-husband Marc Anthony, she launched a humanitarian relief campaign entitled Somos Una Voz (English: We Are One Voice), an effort supported by various celebrities to rush supplies to areas affected by Hurricane Maria.[220] Lopez and Anthony presented a subsequent concert and telethon for disaster relief, ""One Voice: Somos Live!"", which raised over $35 million.[221] She was also among various artists featured on Lin-Manuel Miranda's charity single ""Almost Like Praying"" which benefits Puerto Rico.[222]  Lopez is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has raised millions of dollars for HIV/AIDS research.[223] In June 2013, amfAR presented Lopez with its humanitarian award for her philanthropic work.[223] That September, she was awarded the Ally for Equality award presented by the Human Rights Campaign, for her support of the LGBT community.[224] The following year, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award.[225] In July 2016, Lopez released a single entitled ""Love Make the World Go Round"", a collaboration with Lin-Manuel Miranda, which benefits victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.[226] She was also featured on the song ""Hands"" along with numerous other artists, also benefiting those affected by the Orlando shooting.[227] Among numerous other artists, Lopez signed an open letter from Billboard magazine to the United States Congress in 2016, which demanded action on gun control.[228]  Lopez endorsed President Barack Obama in his 2012 presidential campaign, speaking in television advertisements and attending a fundraising event for Obama in Paris.[229][230] She endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, headlining a free concert in Florida in support of her that October.[230][231]  Artistry  Musical style  According to author Ed Morales in The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond (2003), Lopez's music explores the ""romantic innocence"" of Latin music, while strongly identifying with hip hop.[234] Growing up, she was influenced by Latin styles ranging from salsa to bachata, but it was the 1979 hip hop song ""Rapper's Delight"" by The Sugarhill Gang that she said changed her life.[235] Her debut album On the 6 fuses the influence of Latin music with R&B and hip hop, which Lopez described as Latin soul. To the contrary, Morales described it as ""state-of-the-art dance pop"".[236] Dee Lockett, writing for the Chicago Tribune, stated that songs such as ""Waiting for Tonight"" made Lopez ""arguably the leading artist in the dance-pop movement at the time"".[237] While primarily sung in English, she speaks in Spanish and asserts her Latin heritage throughout the album, which is apparent in the song ""Let's Get Loud"".[238][239][240] She has also recorded bilingual songs, including the Latin pop song ""Cariño"", for her second album J.Lo.[241] A departure from her previous albums, This Is Me... Then blends 1970s soul with ""streetwise"" hip hop.[242] ""Get Right"", from Rebirth, is built around a sample of ""Soul Power 74"" by Maceo and the Macks, and is characterized by a repetitive saxophone riff. The New York Times called it ""one of the year's most unusual R&B songs"" which sounded ""like nothing else on the radio"".[243]  Described as autobiographical,[244] much of Lopez's music has centered around the ""ups and downs"" of love.[245] The lyrical content of This Is Me... Then is largely focused on her relationship with Ben Affleck, with the song ""Dear Ben"" being described as the album's ""glowing centerpiece"".[246] Her first full length Spanish-language album, Como Ama una Mujer features introspective lyrics about romance, heartache and self-loathing.[247] When explaining her seventh studio album Love?, Lopez stated: ""There's still so much to learn and that's why the question mark.""[245] Other recurrent themes in Lopez's music have included her upbringing in the Bronx[236][248] and women's empowerment.[249]  Lopez has been influenced by artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Barbra Streisand.[250][251] She credited Rita Moreno's performance in the 1961 musical film West Side Story as a major inspiration.[236] Critics have considered Lopez's voice to be limited,[252][253] and obscured by the production of her music, while remaining ""radio-friendly"".[254] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone observed: ""Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R&B murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn't need to belt because she knows you're already paying attention [...] She makes a little va-va and a whole lot of voom go a long way.""[255] Meanwhile, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called her voice ""slight"" and wrote: ""Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style"".[256] Entertainment Weekly criticized her vocal performance for lacking the trademark ""husky-voiced voluptuousness"" she has in her films.[257] J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun regards Lopez as having a ""breathy"" stylistic range, but lacking personality.[258]  Dance and stage  Considered one of dance's ""greatest success stories"",[155] Lopez felt an emotional connection to dance since her youth, when she specialized in ballet, jazz and flamenco.[259][260] Her career commenced on the variety television sketch comedy series In Living Color, where she was a part of an ethnically diverse dance group known as the Fly Girls.[261] Janet Jackson, whom she briefly served as a backup dancer for, has been credited by Lopez as an inspiration for her own dance and videos.[262] In 2015, Refinery29 ranked Lopez at number two on ""11 Of Pop's Most Iconic Dancers"", behind Jackson.[263] Since beginning her own recording career, Lopez has become known for her body-emphasizing music videos, which often include dance routines.[264] Some of them have been the subject of controversy, including ""Jenny from the Block"", ""Dance Again"" and ""Booty"".[265][266] Her provocatively choreographed music video for ""If You Had My Love"" allowed Lopez to become a dominant figure on MTV networks worldwide.[267] Madeline Roth of MTV wrote: ""Her diverse videography encompasses some of the most memorable visuals of the 21st century"",[268] with Rolling Stone writer Brittany Spanos observing that her ""dancing skills and ability to toy with her own celebrity have made her videos an important part of the new millennium’s pop canon.""[269]  On stage, Lopez is recognized for her showmanship and sex appeal,[270] and often includes costumes such as bodysuits as part of her performance.[271][272][273] Author Priscilla Peña Ovalle stated in Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex and Stardom (2011) that Lopez was one of the Latin stars who ""used dance to gain agency as working performers with mainstream careers, yet many of their roles paradoxically racialized and sexualized their bodies"".[274] Troy Patterson of Entertainment Weekly also observed that she used her body for emphasis on stage, ""She turned herself out as the fly girl hyperversion of postfeminist power, flaunting her control by toying with the threat of excess. In consequence, her star went supernova.""[275] Her signature movements include ""clock-wise pivoting with salsa hip circles and sequential torso undulations"".[276] While being noted to lip sync in the early stages of career, Lopez's Dance Again World Tour was praised for showcasing live vocals and choreography synchronously.[277][278][279] In a review of her Las Vegas residency All I Have, Los Angeles Times writer Nolan Feeney remarked that her dancing is ""undoubtedly the centerpiece of the show"".[270]  Lopez's provocative stage performances have also drawn scrutiny at times. In May 2013, her performance on the finale of the television series Britain's Got Talent was deemed inappropriate for family-friendly television, and drew viewer complaints to Ofcom.[280][281] Following her controversial performance at the musical festival Mawazine in 2015, Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane called it ""indecent"" and ""disgraceful"", while an education group claimed that she ""disturbed public order and tarnished women's honor and respect"".[282]  Public image  Lopez performing during her Dance Again World Tour, December 2012.  Speaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: ""Despite a carefully cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles ""I'm Real"" and ""Jenny From the Block"". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick either as a primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she's not asking you to come hither.""[233] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: ""Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere."" Holloway noted her image to be ""a dash of ghetto fabulousness"" and ""middle-class respectability"" for mass appeal.[283] Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: ""Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth madre.""[284] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture.[285] Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a ""showbiz phenomenon"".[286]  Lopez is widely celebrated for her callipygian figure,[287] which was the inspiration for Sir Mix-a-Lot's 1992 hit ""Baby Got Back"".[288] She has been credited with influencing a change in mainstream female body image.[289] In Latin Sensations (2001), Herón Marquez wrote: ""Because she wasn't rail thin, Lopez had broken the mold and allowed millions of women to feel good about their bodies. Suddenly, it was okay for women to have hips, curves, and a big backside.""[36] Vanity Fair described her buttocks as ""in and of themselves, a cultural icon"".[290] Details magazine named Lopez the ""Sexiest Woman of the Year"" in 1998,[291] and she led FHM's ""100 Sexiest Women"" list twice.[292] In 2011, she was named ""The Most Beautiful Woman"" by People.[293] The following year, VH1 ranked her the fourth on their list of ""100 Sexiest Artists"",[294] while Vibe magazine named her the most ""lustable"" celebrity of the past twenty years.[295] In 2014, Lopez stated, ""There's this funny notion in America that you can't be a mom and be sexy (...) It's the craziest thing I've ever heard... The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die.""[131]  Lopez is a tabloid fixture[296][297] and has admitted to having a ""less-than-perfect"" public image.[298] The media often draw comparisons between Lopez and actress Elizabeth Taylor, due to her numerous failed relationships.[299][300] In fact, Lopez has been dubbed a ""modern-day Liz Taylor"" by the media.[301] Lynn Hirschberg of W compared her glamorous public persona to that of Taylor.[302] Her style is described by Billboard's Lauren Savage as scantily clad.[303] Lopez has been criticized by the animal rights organization PETA for inclusion of fur in her fashion lines and outfits.[304] She has received a bad reputation as being a demanding ""diva"",[305] but she constantly refutes this.[306] In 2003, The Observer remarked that Lopez was ""the woman immortalised in a million headlines as 'Hollywood's most demanding diva' ... Lopez must wonder what heinous crime she has committed to become the most vilified woman in modern popular culture.""[307]  Legacy and cultural impact  Lopez is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, credited with breaking racial barriers in the entertainment industry.[11][308] In 1999, The Record newspaper observed that she was responsible for the introduction of a Latina presence in the film industry, which was a ""whites-only preserve"" for much of its history.[309] Described as a ""multidimensional artist who had turned into a financial powerhouse"",[310] Lopez became the highest-paid actress of Hispanic descent in history.[311] Miriam Jiménez Román stated in The Afro-Latin Reader: History and Culture in the United States (2009) that ""[she] was able to traverse the difficult racial boundaries"".[312] In 2012, business magazine Forbes suggested that Lopez ""may be the most powerful entertainer on the planet"",[313] and named her ""the world's most powerful Latino celebrity"".[314]  Upon launching her music career in the late 1990s, Lopez contributed to the ""Latin explosion"" occurring in entertainment at the time.[315] Writing for The Recording Academy, Brian Haack described her as the ""breakout female star"" of the Latin pop movement in American music.[316] She was featured on the cover of the first issue of Latina magazine in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza stating that there is ""no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer"".[317] Around the time her career began to burgeon, the emphasis on Lopez's curvaceous figure grew; scholar Sean Redmond wrote that this was a sign of her role and social power in the cultural changes occurring in the United States.[318] In August 2005, Time listed Lopez as one of the most influential Hispanics in America, remarking: ""Why? Because over a decade ago, she was an anonymous background dancer on the second-rated sketch-comedy show. Today she's known by two syllables.""[45] In February 2007, People en Español named her the most influential Hispanic entertainer.[308] In 2014, scientists named a species of aquatic mite found in Puerto Rico, Litarachna lopezae, after Lopez.[319][320]  Lopez is considered a global icon, and is often described as a triple threat performer.[321][322][323] VH1 ranked her at number 15 on their list of 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons,[324] number 16 on 100 Greatest Women In Music,[325] and number 21 on 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era.[326] Lopez has been cited as an influence or inspiration by a range of entertainers, including Jessica Alba,[327] Adrienne Bailon,[328] Kat DeLuna,[329] Mike Doughty,[330] Fifth Harmony,[331] Becky G,[332] Selena Gomez,[333] Ryan Guzman,[334] Kelly Key,[335] Q'orianka Kilcher,[336] Demi Lovato,[337] Normani,[338] Pitbull,[339] Francia Raisa,[328] Naya Rivera,[340] Bebe Rexha,[341] Gwen Stefani,[342] Stooshe,[343] and Kerry Washington.[344]  Famed for her distinct style and fashion sense, Us Weekly named Lopez ""Style Icon"" of the 2000s decade.[345] The Green Versace ""Jungle Dress"" that she wore at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000 was voted the fifth most iconic red carpet dress of all time in a poll run by The Daily Telegraph.[346] The images of Lopez wearing the dress became the most popular search query of all time at that point, and subsequently led to the creation of Google's image search.[347][348] Her style has influenced a range of celebrities, including Kelly Rowland, Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Love Hewitt.[349][350][351] Her record-breaking fragrance line has become the most successful celebrity line in the world, with sales exceeding $2 billion as of 2012.[352] Her first fragrance, Glow by JLo, has been credited with influencing the rise of celebrity fragrances in the 2000s,[353] with perfume critic Chandler Burr stating: ""Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive.""[354] Following the success of Lopez's appointment as a judge on American Idol in 2010, a trend of networks hiring ""big names"" for judging panels on reality shows ensued. The Hollywood Reporter branded this ""The J.Lo Effect"".[355]  Achievements  As of 2018, Lopez has sold more than 80 million records worldwide, including 40 million albums,[356] and her films have grossed a cumulative total of US$2.9 billion.[357] She remains the only female entertainer to have a number one album and film simultaneously in the United States.[358][359] With her second studio album J.Lo (2001), Lopez became the first female solo recording artist under Epic Records to achieve a number one album in the United States since its inception in 1953.[360] Her album J to tha L-O! The Remixes was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records as the first number one remix album in the United States.[361] In 2010, Lopez was honored by the World Music Awards with the Legend Award for her contribution to the arts.[362] Lopez's return to prominence the following year with her single ""On the Floor""—among the best-selling singles of all time, and its music video recognized as the ""Highest Viewed Female Music Video of All Time"" by Guinness World Records in 2012—is regarded as one of the greatest musical comebacks in history.[363][364] In 2013, she was presented with the prestigious landmark 2,500th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her musical contributions,[365] and Univision presented her with the World Icon Award in its Premios Juventud.[366] In 2014, she became the first female recipient of the Billboard Icon Award.[367] Billboard magazine ranked her as the ninth greatest dance club artist of all time in 2016.[368] In 2017, she was awarded the Telemundo Star Award.[369] In 2018, Lopez received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the first Latin performer to claim the prize since its introduction in 1984.[370]  Discography  Filmography  Tours and concerts  Tours  Residency concerts  See also  References  Further reading  Gallick, Sarah (2003).

"Prior to her hospitalization for an apparent drug overdose on Tuesday, the singer had revealed she broke her sobriety in new single ""Sober.""  Demi Lovato was hospitalized for an apparent drug overdose on Tuesday. Hours later, the pop star's representative confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that she was ""awake and with her family"" following the health scare.  ""Demi is awake and with her family, who want to express thanks to everyone for the love, prayers and support,"" the statement read. ""Some of the information being reported is incorrect, and they respectfully ask for privacy and not speculation, as her health and recovery is the most important thing right now.""  Los Angeles police said, earlier on Tuesday, that they responded to a call at 11:39 a.m. to a home on the 8000 block of Laurel View Drive in the Hollywood Hills, where Lovato lives, for a female victim of a possible overdose. The 25-year-old was reportedly administered Narcan, which is used to treat narcotic overdoses in emergency situations.  The incident occurred just weeks after the former Disney Channel star and reformed addict wrote about breaking her sobriety in her latest track, ""Sober."" In the song, Lovato details her experience with withdrawals and the emotional aftermath of a relapse. The singer had been sober for six years.  ""Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore/ And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor,"" she sings. ""To the ones who never left me/ We've been down this road before/ I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore.""  Lovato posted a video of an early performance of the song on Twitter with the message, ""Tonight I took the stage, a new person with a new life. Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey. It will never be forgotten.""  She most recently performed the song live at the California Mid-State Fair in Paso Robles on July 22. Lovato reportedly got emotional onstage and forgot some of the lyrics at the end of the song. ""Fuck, I forgot the words,"" Lovato said before walking offstage, an eyewitness recalled to Us Weekly, adding that the entertainer also ""had tears in her eyes.""  Years before the release of ""Sober,"" Lovato — who first checked in to rehab at the age of 18 in 2010 and then entered a sober house for approximately a year in 2013 — had been open about facing her demons. In 2011, Lovato was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of struggling with an eating disorder and self harm, in addition to her drug addiction.  During a 2013 interview with Access Hollywood, Lovato revealed the moment of reckoning she had at age 19. ""I was going to the airport and I had a Sprite bottle just filled with vodka, and it was just 9 in the morning. And I was throwing up in the car, and this was just to get on a plane to go back to L.A. to the sober living house that I was staying at,"" she recounted. ""I had all the help in the world, but I didn't want it.""  In 2015, Lovato — who co-owns the L.A. treatment facility CAST Centers — explained to Women's Health why she decided to speak openly about her experience in rehab and become a mental health advocate. According to the Camp Rock actress, she had hoped her honesty would help others going through similar situations.  ""I remember sitting with my manager and my family and talking to them about whether or not to speak out about the issues that I was dealing with,"" she said about using her platform to raise awareness. ""I knew that there were two options: I could either not talk about my stint in rehab and hope that it went away, or I could talk about it and inspire people to get help for their issues, as well, so that's exactly what I did.""  She also discussed her diagnosis and the work she has put in to maintain a healthy mind: ""For years, people said I was depressed, and I actually didn't know myself why I was so upset and why I would have these episodes of mania — what I now know is mania.""  While appearing on the U.K.'s The Jonathan Ross Show in 2017, the ""Sorry Not Sorry"" singer said that her parents' tough love had helped her stay on track in recent years. ""I knew that I had a lot of life ahead of me, but one of the main reasons of getting sober was so that I could be around my little sister because my mom and dad [said I couldn't be around her] if I was doing stuff,"" she said, adding that she was also thankful for the support from her fans and inner circle.  ""I had family and really close friends and my manager — they all were by my side through everything,"" Lovato continued. ""I wouldn't be here without them. My fans too. I feel they gave me a reason to live and I'm forever grateful.""  Last year, the Grammy nominee was the recipient of the Spirit of Sobriety Award at the annual Brent Shapiro Foundation for Drug Prevention Summer Spectacular. In her acceptance speech, Lovato admitted that ""every day is a battle.""  ""You just have to take it one day at a time; some days are easier than others and some days you forget about drinking and using, but for me, I work on my physical health, which is important, but my mental health as well,"" she said. ""I make sure I stay on my medications. I go to AA meetings. I do what I can physically in the gym. I make it a priority.""  In her 2017 documentary, Simply Complicated, Lovato offered insight into her initial attraction to drugs and alcohol. ""I felt out of control the first time I did it,"" she said. ""My dad was an addict and an alcoholic. Guess I always searched for what he found in drugs and alcohol, because it fulfilled him, and he chose that over a family.""  Elsewhere in the film, Lovato said that she ""wasn't ready to get sober"" during her first rehab stint as a teen: ""I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night.""  In the wake of her apparent overdose on Tuesday, a multitude of stars — including Lady Gaga, Ellen DeGeneres and Ariana Grande — have taken to Twitter to express their well wishes for Lovato and have urged the public to be kind as she recovers.  ""We should all wrap our arms of love around Demi Lovato. I am so happy you're alive. Thank God,"" wrote Gaga. ""If I know my monsters as well as I believe I do, we all wish you self-compassion and inner peace. And may you receive the love so many have for you. #ImConfidentinDemi Demi, I love you.""",0
"Four sisters of Josh Duggar have filed a federal invasion of privacy suit against In Touch Weekly, which revealed two years ago that their brother had been investigated for sexual molestation. The original story led to the cancellation of the TLC reality show “19 Kids and Counting.”  The sisters are not contesting the accuracy of the In Touch report — indeed, they themselves subsequently confirmed that they were the victims in the case. Instead, they seem to be following the playbook of Hulk Hogan, who brought down Gawker with an invasion-of-privacy claim.  The sisters — Jill Dillard, Joy Duggar, Jessa Seewald, and Jinger Vuolo — also sued the city of Springdale, Arkansas, and Washington County, Arkansas, which released investigative records to In Touch pursuant to a public records request. The suit alleges that the localities violated state and federal privacy laws in releasing the documents.  “Plaintiffs had no knowledge that the highly personal and painful details revealed in their confidential interviews would be disclosed to anyone except law enforcement and child services personnel,” the suit states. “Indeed, they were instructed that their statements would remain confidential and not be released to the public.”  Related Josh Duggar Apologizes: ‘I Have Been the Biggest Hypocrite Ever’  According to the suit, local officials provided the sensitive police records just five days after receiving a records request from In Touch’s lawyer. The suit alleges that officials in the small town failed to properly consult with various branches of government before releasing the documents. If they had done so, the plaintiffs allege they would have discovered that juvenile records were not subject to disclosure.  The suit cites speculation within the Springdale Police Department that a department source had leaked information about the case to the media, given that outlets seemed to know exactly which records to ask for. The records did not name the victims, but the suit alleges that online commentators were quickly able to puzzle out the girls’ identities.  “Plaintiffs were subjected to spiteful and harsh comments and harassment on the Internet and in their daily lives,” the suit states. “Some chastised their personal decision to forgive their brother while others used the opportunity to provide unwarranted commentary on all aspects of Plaintiffs’ lives. Others simply reveled in the ad hoc disclosure of the lurid details of Plaintiffs’ suffering.”  Unlike in the Hogan case, the material published by In Touch came from a government proceeding. News organizations are generally given wide leeway in the reporting of governmental conduct.  In Touch has not responded. A spokesman for the city of Springdale told TMZ, which first reported the suit, that the claims are “without merit and false.”",0
"Despite rumors that Sandra Bullock secretly wed boyfriend Bryan Randall, a rep for the actress tells Us Weekly that there is no truth to that.  “They are not married,” the rep confirmed to Us of the 53-year-old Gravity star and her photographer beau. The couple, who have been dating for over two and a half years, have not yet tied the knot.  Back in November, a pal of Bullock’s talked to Us about her relationship with the Los Angeles-based photog and described him as “one of the nicest guys ever.” The friend added: “Bryan has fully stepped up and embraced the dad role. He is 100 percent there for Louis and Laila and wonderful with them in every way. Sandy feels incredibly fortunate and blessed that she is sharing the parenting journey with Bryan.”  The couple’s relationship comes after Bullock’s turbulent marriage to West Coast Choppers owner Jesse James. The two divorced in 2010 after James admitted to cheating on her with multiple women throughout their five-year union.  The Proposal star opened up to Vogue in October 2013 about her divorce: “We’re all where we’re supposed to be,” she told the mag at the time. “I am exactly where I want to be now. You can’t go backward. I’m not going backward. I’m grateful that I’m here, blessed to have what I have. Nobody can be prepared for anything.”  Bullock has two adopted children — a son, Louis, now 8, and daughter, Laila, now 6.

The 36-year-old princess and her lover Dodi Fayed , 42, were killed along with chauffeur Henri Paul when their Mercedes crashed in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris on August 31 1997.  They were being pursued by paparazzi photographers after leaving the Ritz Hotel for Mr Fayed's apartment.  In 2008, after hearing evidence over six months, an inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, saying driver Paul and the paparazzi shared the blame for the deaths.  (Image: PA)  Speaking in the BBC documentary Diana, 7 Days, Harry said: ""One of the hardest things to come to terms with is the people who chased her into the tunnel were the same people who were taking photographs of her while she was still dying on the back seat of the car.  ""And William and I know that, we've been told that numerous times by people that know that was the case.  ""She'd had quite a severe head injury but she was very much alive on the back seat.  (Image: Reuters)  (Image: Reuters)  ""And those people that caused the accident instead of helping were taking photographs of her dying on the back seat.  ""And then those photographs made their way back to newsdesks in this country.""  (Image: PA)  No UK title ever published the sickening pictures.  Prince William added that a ""pack"" would hound and chase his mother, spitting at the royal and calling her names to get a reaction.  William told the documentary, which will be screened on Sunday, that people today would find the treatment of his mother ""utterly appalling"".  (Image: BBC)  (Image: Getty)  He added: ""We'd go looking for her to talk to, play, to do whatever, she'd be crying. And when that was the case it was to do with press.  ""She'd had a confrontation with photographers on the way to the gym, on the way outside, just trying to do day to day stuff.  ""The damage for me was being a little boy aged eight, nine, 10, whatever it was, wanting to protect your mother and finding it very difficult seeing her very upset.  (Image: Flynet Pictures)  ""About every single time she went out there'd be a pack of people waiting for her.  ""And I mean a pack, like a pack of dogs, followed her, chased her, harassed her, called her names, spat at her, tried to get a reaction to get that photograph of her lashing out, get her upset.""  His brother said on one occasion she stopped the car on the way to the gym with the royal brothers on the back seat and confronted those pursuing her before returning crying.",0
"Jake Zyrus came out as transgender while changing his social media usernames in June. (Photo: Photo courtesy of Jake Zyrus)  Jake Zyrus, the Filipino singer and Glee star formerly known as Charice Pempengco, says life since coming out as transgender has been ""surreal.""  What started out as simply changing his screen name so he wouldn’t “be stuck in [the] past"" has turned into a flurry of articles about the star's identity, a buzz that Zyrus didn't intend to create.  ""I just thought that I was going to change my social networking sites’ user names, and I just didn’t think that everyone would pick it up,"" the singer explained. ""But when... everyone was talking about it, I was like, ‘I guess this is the perfect time.’ It was Pride Month and I just saw that everything was happening in the right place, right time and I started talking about it.”  Following his coming out via Twitter and Instagram in June, the singer, 25, spoke with USA TODAY about his transgender journey, music career and life since his recent name change.  Not only surprised by the buzz his name change created, Zyrus, who lives in the Philippines, was also surprised with how accepting his fans have been of the news.  ""When I thought about finally coming out as a transgender man, I didn’t think a lot of people would actually agree to it and accept me, but I was surprised with the love and support,"" he said. ""So I’ve been doing great, I’ve been feeling good about everything. I’ve been happy.""  His family members, who found out at the same time fans did, were not as positive in their reactions. Describing them as not ""open with LGBT people"" from a country ""still having a hard time trying to ask for equality and freedom,"" Zyrus said his relationship with family has been ""kind of on-and-off.""  ""Their reaction was expected. Right now we’re not ok, but... I know that someday they will find some peace in their heart and [know that] whatever I’m doing right now is for my happiness and is who I really am.”  The news also garnered some pushback in the Filipino media community. Esquire Philippines published a since-removed story on June 20 titled ""Jake Zyrus and The Challenges of Personal Reinvention,"" which people criticized for insulting transgender people. The publication issued a lengthy apology.  Zyrus, who accepted the apology on Twitter, said that he didn't take the article too seriously, but was ""touched"" by others who stood up for him.  Fear of that type of blowback was, in part, what kept Zyrusfrom fully embracing his identity sooner, though he discussed it with Oprah Winfrey in 2014. In a special Where Are They Now episode, Zyrus told the host he was gay, though now says it was out of fear of coming out as trans.  ""In the Philippines it was so hard because, at that time, nobody ever talked about transgender people,"" he explained. ""So I was scared to actually go out there and be one of those first people -- I was scared basically to tell them, ‘Hey, I know that I’m a man. I know that I’m transgender.'""  When Winfrey asked if he struggled with gender identity, however, he responded ""my soul is male.""  A feeling, Zyrus said, he's felt since he was a kid.  ""I didn’t know the gender labels yet. I didn’t know the words lesbian or transgender, but I knew that Charice wasn’t the right name for me,"" he explained.  So how did the singer come up with his new name? Zyrus said he ""just felt it.""  ""I came up with so many names. There was Christian, there was Kyle. But when I kept saying, ‘Jake, Jake’ in front of the mirror, I just thought that it was the name for me,"" he explained.  He decided on ""Zyrus"" because he thought it sounded like a performer.  ""If I perform onstage all over the world, it made me feel good thinking about the fans shouting my name,"" he said. ""And I just imagined everything and it made me happy.""  Although the singer's name is new, Zyrus isn't new to the spotlight.  After landing a spot on the Filipino American Idol-style show Little Big Star in 2005, the singer gained popularity posting performances on YouTube. An appearance on The Ellen Show in 2007 raised his profile in the U.S.  The singer's then-self-titled album Charice went to No. 8 on Billboard's album chart in 2010, making Zyrus the first Asian solo singer to land in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 albums chart. Later that year he landed a recurring role on Glee, playing Sunshine Corazon, a foreign exchange student and vocal rival to one of the show's leads, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele).

""Whatever happens, happens. I’m really just trying to live my life as much as possible,"" he says.  Zyrus's new single Hiling (which means ""wish"" in English) dropped July 5, his first track under his new name, which he describes as a cheesy love song. His last album Catharsis released in October 2016.  He's also looking forward to performing outside of the Philippines soon, with discussions of larger concerts and an album happening in the near future.  ""I’m just letting everything happen to me,"" he says. ""I’m just really happy that I’m going to be able to share my music again.""  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2uJRQDV",0

"Kate Noelle ""Katie"" Holmes (born December 18, 1978)[7] is an American actress, producer, and director. She first achieved fame as Joey Potter on the television series Dawson's Creek (1998–2003).  She made her feature film debut in Ang Lee's The Ice Storm in 1997. Subsequent film roles include: Go, Teaching Mrs. Tingle (both 1999), Wonder Boys, The Gift (both 2000), Abandon (2002), Phone Booth, The Singing Detective, Pieces of April (all 2003), Batman Begins (2005), Thank You for Smoking (2006), Mad Money (2008), Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Jack and Jill (both 2011), Miss Meadows (2014), Woman in Gold, Touched with Fire (both 2015), and Logan Lucky (2017).  In 2008, she made her Broadway theatre debut in a production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons. In 2011, she played Jacqueline Kennedy in the TV miniseries The Kennedys, a role she reprised in The Kennedys: After Camelot (2017). She made her directional debut with the 2016 film All We Had, in which she also starred.  Her marriage to actor Tom Cruise[8] from 2006 to 2012 led to a great deal of media attention, with the pair being called a supercouple and being given the nickname ""TomKat"" in various countries.  Early life [ edit ]  Holmes was born in Toledo, Ohio.[9] She is the youngest of five children born to Kathleen, a homemaker and philanthropist, and Martin Joseph Holmes, Sr., an attorney.[10][11] She has three sisters and one brother. Holmes was baptized a Roman Catholic and attended Christ the King Church in Toledo.[12]  She graduated from the all-female Notre Dame Academy in Toledo (also her mother's alma mater), where she was a 4.0 student.[13][14] At St. John's Jesuit and St. Francis de Sales, nearby all-male high schools, Holmes appeared in school musicals, playing a waitress in Hello, Dolly! and Lola in Damn Yankees.[15] She scored 1310 out of 1600 on her SAT and was accepted to Columbia University (and attended for a summer session);[9][13] her father wanted her to become a doctor.[14]  At age 14, she began classes at a modeling school in Toledo which led her to the International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) Competition held in New York City in 1996. Eventually, Holmes was signed to an agent after performing a monologue from To Kill a Mockingbird.[6] An audition tape was sent to the casting director for the 1997 film The Ice Storm, directed by Ang Lee, and Holmes made her big-screen debut in the role of Libbets Casey in the film, opposite Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver.[15]  Career [ edit ]  1997–2003: Dawson's Creek and career development [ edit ]  Holmes in May 2006  In January 1997, Holmes went to Los Angeles for pilot season, when producers cast and shoot new programs in the hopes of securing a spot on a network schedule. The Toledo Blade reported she was offered the lead in Buffy the Vampire Slayer but she turned it down in order to finish high school.[15] Columbia TriStar Television, producer of a new show named Dawson's Creek that was created by screenwriter Kevin Williamson, asked her to come to Los Angeles to audition, but there was a conflict with her schedule. ""I was doing my school play, Damn Yankees. And I was playing Lola. I even got to wear the feather boa. I thought, 'There is no way I'm not playing Lola to go audition for some network. I couldn't let my school down. We had already sold a lot of tickets. So I told Kevin and The WB, 'I'm sorry. I just can't meet with you this week. I've got other commitments.'""[5][15][16]  The producers permitted her to audition on videotape. Holmes read for the part of Joey Potter, the tomboy best friend of the title character Dawson, on a videotape shot in her basement, her mother reading Dawson's lines.[5][17]  The Hollywood Reporter claimed the story of Holmes's audition ""has become the stuff of legend"" and ""no one even thought that it was weird that one of the female leads would audition via Federal Express.""[18] Holmes won the part. Paul Stupin, executive producer of the show, said his first reaction on seeing her audition tape was ""That's Joey Potter!""[19] Creator and executive producer Kevin Williamson said Holmes has a ""unique combination of talent, beauty and skill that makes Hollywood come calling. But that's just the beginning. To meet her is to instantly fall under her spell.""[20] Williamson thought she had exactly the right look for Joey Potter. ""She had those eyes, those eyes just stained with loneliness.""[21] While Dawson's Creek was met with mixed reviews,[22] Holmes attained national attention.[23][24] Holmes was soon on the covers of magazines such as Seventeen, TV Guide, and Rolling Stone. Jancee Dunn, an editor at Rolling Stone said she was chosen for the cover because ""every time you mention Dawson's Creek you tend to get a lot of dolphin-like shrieks from teenage girls. The fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous didn't hurt either.""[25]  During her time as a series regular on Dawson's Creek, Holmes first leading role in a film came in 1998's Disturbing Behavior, a Scream-era Stepford Wives-goes-to-high school thriller, where she was a loner from the wrong side of the tracks. The film was recut from what the director intended. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote her character, Rachel, ""dresses in black and likes to strike poses on the beds of pickup trucks and is a bad girl who is in great danger of becoming a very good one.""[26][27] Despite the fact that it received mixed reviews and was not a huge financial success, the actress won a MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance for the role and also received a Saturn Award nomination for the part. Holmes, though, said the film was ""just horrible.""[14] In 1999, she played a disaffected supermarket clerk in Doug Liman's ensemble piece Go.[28] The film received excellent reviews and made a profit, and Holmes herself was liked by critics. The same year, in Kevin Williamson's Teaching Mrs. Tingle, which he wrote and directed, Holmes played a straight-A student whose vindictive teacher (Helen Mirren) threatens to keep her from a desperately needed scholarship.[29] Also in 1999, she had an uncredited cameo with Dawson's Creek co-star Joshua Jackson in Muppets from Space, which was filmed in Wilmington where Dawson's Creek also filmed.[30]  The year 2000 saw Holmes feature in two film roles. The first was in Wonder Boys, directed by Curtis Hanson from the novel by Michael Chabon. The film told the story of a creative writing teacher at a university, with Michael Douglas in the leading role. Holmes had a small role (six and one-half minutes of screen time) as Hannah Green, the talented student who lusts after Professor Grady Tripp (Douglas's character, who is her instructor and landlord). Many leading critics at the time took favorable notice to Holmes in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said she was ""just right as the beauty with kind of a crush on the old man.""[21][31][32] Her second feature film during 2000 was The Gift, a Southern Gothic story directed by Sam Raimi and starring Cate Blanchett, she played the antithesis of Joey Potter: a promiscuous rich girl having affairs with everyone from a sociopathic wife-beater (Keanu Reeves) to the district attorney (Gary Cole), and is murdered by her fiancé (Greg Kinnear). Holmes did her first nude scene for the film, in a scene where her character was about to be murdered. Her appearance was lamented by Variety's Steven Kotler.[33] In Ohio, the scene met with disapproval from Russ Lemmon writing in the Toledo Blade.[34]  Holmes hosted Saturday Night Live on February 24, 2001, participating in a send-up of Dawson's Creek where she falls madly in love with Chris Kattan's Mr. Peepers character and singing ""Big Spender"" from Sweet Charity. In the 2002 film Abandon, written by Oscar winner Stephen Gaghan, Holmes plays a delusional, homicidal college student named ""Katie"". Todd McCarthy of Variety and Roger Ebert commended her performance,[35] but other critics savaged it.[36] During the final season of Dawson's Creek, Holmes played the mistress of the public relations flack played by Colin Farrell in Phone Booth, which was both critically and financially successful. She also appeared as Robert Downey, Jr.'s nurse in The Singing Detective (2003). Dawson's Creek ended its run in 2003, and Holmes was the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes. ""It was very difficult for me to leave Wilmington, to have my little glass bubble burst and move on. I hate change. On the other hand it was refreshing to play someone else"", she said in 2004.[37]  2003–2009: Focus on film career, brief hiatus, and theatre work [ edit ]  Holmes' first starring role post-Dawson's Creek was in 2003's Pieces of April, a gritty comedy about a dysfunctional family on Thanksgiving. Many critics and audiences agreed that Holmes had given her best performance in the film as April. Variety said it was ""one of her best film performances.""[38] ""Each actor shines"", wrote Elvis Mitchell, ""even Ms. Holmes, whose beauty seems to have fogged the minds of her previous directors"" in playing ""a brat who is slaving to find her inner decency and barely has the equipment for such an achievement, let alone to serve a meal whose salmonella potential could claim an entire borough. Yet it is her surliness, as well as her intransigent determination to make Thanksgiving work, that keeps the laughs coming.""[39] Holmes also received a Satellite Award for Best Actress for the role. On the November 9, 2003 episode, she was Punk'd by Ashton Kutcher and the next year she was the subject of an episode of the MTV program Diary.[40]  Holmes was a contender for the role of Christine Daaé in 2004's The Phantom of the Opera,[41] but lost the role to Emmy Rossum. She later played the President's daughter in First Daughter, which was originally to be released in January 2004 on the same day as Chasing Liberty, another film about a president's daughter, but was ultimately released in September 2004 to dismal reviews and ticket sales. First Daughter, directed by Forest Whitaker, also starred Michael Keaton as her father and Marc Blucas as her love interest. The Hollywood Reporter critic called her character, Samantha Mackenzie, ""a startling example of how a studio film can dumb down and neutralize the comic abilities of a lively young star.""[42] In the 2005 film Batman Begins she played Rachel Dawes, an attorney in the Gotham City district attorney's office and the childhood sweetheart of the title character. Variety was unenthusiastic. ""Holmes is OK"", was its critic's sole remark on her performance.[43] She was nominated for a Golden Raspberry for ""worst supporting actress"" for the film.[44]  In 2005, Holmes characterised her film career as being a string of ""bombs."" ""Usually I'm not even in the top ten"", she said, the highest-grossing film of her career then being Phone Booth.[3] She lamented ""It's not like I have a lot of stuff that's great just waiting for me to sign on to.""[45] She also appeared in the film version of Christopher Buckley's satirical novel Thank You for Smoking about a tobacco lobbyist played by Aaron Eckhart, whom Holmes's character, a Washington reporter, seduces. Variety wrote one of the film's ""sole relatively weak notes [came] from Holmes, who lacks even a hint of the wiliness of a ruthless reporter"" and The New York Times said the cast was ""exceptionally fine"" except for Holmes, who ""strain[ed] credulity"" in her role.[46][47] The film ended up a success, even earning a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Also in 2005, Holmes had agreed to play in Shame on You, a biopic about the country singer Spade Cooley written and directed by Dennis Quaid, as the wife whom Cooley (played by Quaid) stomps to death. But the picture, set to shoot in New Orleans, Louisiana, was delayed by Hurricane Katrina, and Holmes dropped out due to her pregnancy.[48][49][50] After her daughter, Suri Cruise, was born in April 2006, Holmes took a hiatus from her acting career until 2008.[citation needed]  After speculation about Holmes reprising her role in The Dark Knight, the sequel to Batman Begins, it was finally confirmed that she would not appear. Her role was later recast with Maggie Gyllenhaal in her place.[51] Instead, Holmes decided to star in the comedy Mad Money, opposite Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah in 2008. The film flopped.[52] The Canadian Press criticized Holmes's performance, ""While Keaton has long done zany and giddy well, and she and Latifah have an interesting contrast of personalities, Holmes' presence feels like an afterthought.""[53] The New York Post, the New York Times and Variety also criticized Holmes' performance in the film, and the New York Times called Holmes ""the movie's weakest link"".[54][55]  Returning to television in 2008, Holmes appeared in an episode of Eli Stone as Grace, a lawyer, and her singing and dancing was praised by Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly.[56] Holmes made her Broadway debut in the revival of Arthur Miller's All My Sons[57] in October 2008. She opened to mixed reviews. Ben Brantley of The New York Times claimed ""the neophyte Ms. Holmes"" is a ""sad casualty"" of director Simon McBurney's ""high concept approach"" to the play. He adds that ""Ms. Holmes delivers most of her lines with meaningful asperity, italicizing every word.""[58] Clive Barnes of the New York Post was similarly unimpressed by Holmes – and had few compliments for her co-stars. He wrote, ""John Lithgow starts in a sunny, benign fashion, but eventually finds himself screeching alongside Holmes, looking tough under a glossy wig.""[59] However, the New York Daily News' Joe Dziemianowicz took a more positive view of her stage debut, writing, ""Holmes, a TV and film vet, makes a fine Broadway debut. Her rather grand speech pattern takes getting used to, but she seems comfortable and adds a fitting glint of glamour.""[60] In 2009, Holmes appeared in the National Memorial Day Concert on the Mall in Washington, D.C. in a dialogue with Dianne Wiest celebrating the life of an American veteran seriously wounded in Iraq, José Pequeño.[61]  2010–present: Television work and return to film [ edit ]  In early July 2009, Holmes began filming a remake of the 1970s ABC telemovie Don't Be Afraid of the Dark; the film was released in August 2011.[62] Also in 2011, Holmes played the role of Jackie Kennedy in the TV miniseries The Kennedys. In October 2011, she also portrayed ""Slutty Pumpkin"" (Naomi), in the TV show How I Met Your Mother, episode ""The Slutty Pumpkin Returns"".[citation needed]  In late 2012, Holmes was set to appear in Theresa Rebeck's Dead Accounts on Broadway.[63] Holmes and Chace Crawford were reportedly cast as the leads in the romantic comedy Responsible Adults, to begin shooting in Los Angeles in ""Fall 2011"".[64][65][66] In 2015, Holmes joined the third season of Ray Donovan.[67]  Holmes directed a short 2015 documentary for ESPN about Olympic gymnast Nadia Comăneci entitled, Eternal Princess, that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.[68][69]  In 2017, Holmes starred in the heist comedy Logan Lucky, and in 2018, she will appear in the satirical comedy Dear Dictator, opposite Michael Caine.[70]  In a September 2016 Elle interview, Holmes stated that she is in the process of adapting the Kathleen Tessaro novel Rare Objects into a screenplay and will direct the film.[71] It was announced Holmes will also be leading a feature film based around the self-help book, The Secret, by Rhonda Byrne.[72]  Public image [ edit ]  Holmes was annually named by both the British and American editions of FHM magazine as one of the sexiest women in the world from 1999 onward. She was named one of People's ""50 Most Beautiful People"" in 2003; its sibling Teen People declared her one of the ""25 Hottest Stars Under 25"" that year;[73][74] and in 2005, People said she was one of the ten best dressed stars that year.[75] She has appeared in advertisements for Garnier Lumia haircolor, Coach leather goods, and clothing retailer Gap.[76]  In November 2008, it was confirmed that she would be the new face of the spring 2009 campaign for the high-end fashion line Miu Miu.[77] In 2008, Holmes started a high fashion clothing line called Holmes & Yang with longtime stylist Jeanne Yang.[78] Model Heidi Klum is a fan of the line.[79] In July 2009, Holmes, Nigel Lythgoe, Adam Shankman, and Carrie Ann Inaba announced the launch of a dance scholarship fund called the Dizzy Feet Foundation.[80]  Beginning January 2011, she became the new face of Ann Taylor Spring 11 collection.[81] Holmes & Yang presented their fashion line at New York Fashion Week for the first time in September 2012.[82][83] Holmes acted as the face for the Bobbi Brown Cosmetics brand in spring 2013 and Holmes had her own capsule collection of color cosmetics in fall of that year.[84] In 2013, she appeared in an advertising campaign for IRIS Jewelry.[85] In January 2013, Holmes was announced as the brand ambassador and co-owner of Alterna Haircare.[86]  Personal life [ edit ]  Holmes with Tom Cruise in May 2009  Holmes dated her Dawson's Creek co-star Joshua Jackson early in the show's run.[87] She met actor Chris Klein in 2000. Klein and Holmes were engaged in late 2003, but in early 2005 she and Klein ended their relationship.[88][89][90][91] Klein and Holmes have remained friends to varying degrees since the breakup.[92]  Only a couple of weeks after her relationship with Klein ended, Holmes began dating actor Tom Cruise in April 2005. Holmes, who was raised a Catholic,[93] began studying Scientology shortly after the couple began dating.[94] They got engaged in June 2005, only seven weeks after meeting.[95] The couple's daughter, Suri, was born on April 18, 2006, the one-year anniversary of their first date. The name ""Suri"" supposedly derives from the Persian meaning ""Red Rose"" and the Hebrew as a derivative of ""Sarah"" meaning princess.[96] On November 18, 2006, Holmes and Cruise were married in a Scientologist ceremony at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy.[8] The actors' publicist said the couple had ""officialized"" their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony.[97]  Holmes and Cruise were last photographed together in Iceland on June 16, 2012. On June 29, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise in New York after five and a half years of marriage.[98][99] Following the announcement, those close to Holmes stated that she believed she had reason to fear that Cruise would abduct Suri, and also feared intimidation by the Church of Scientology.[100][101]  Only ten days after Holmes filed for divorce, on July 9, 2012, attorneys for the couple announced that the couple had signed a divorce settlement.[102] This was the first divorce for Holmes and the third for Cruise.[103][104] Holmes has custody of Suri.[105]  Following her divorce from Cruise, Holmes returned to the Roman Catholic Church and began attending St. Francis Xavier Church.[106]  Legal issues [ edit ]  In early March 2011, Holmes filed a $50-million libel lawsuit against Star magazine following a cover story which insinuated that she took drugs.[107] The suit was settled on April 27, 2011, after which Star wrote a public apology in the May 6, 2011 issue and made an ""undisclosed substantial donation"" to Holmes's charity, Dizzy Feet Foundation.[108]  Awards [ edit ]  In June 2011, Holmes received the Women in Film Max Mara Face of the Future Award.[109]  In 2005, TV Guide ranked Holmes No. 38 on its ""50 Sexiest Stars of All Time"" list.[110]  Filmography [ edit ]  Video games Year Title Role Notes 2005 Batman Begins Rachel Dawes Voice  Notes [ edit ]  ^ [1] and others ""Kate"" to be Holmes' legal name.[2][3][4][5][6] The Several sources state ""Katherine""and others ""Kate"" to be Holmes' legal name.The birth certificate of Holmes's daughter, Suri, lists the actress's name as ""Kate Noelle Holmes"".

"• American walks out of after media questions about Florida crash • Five-times champion beats Elise Mertens 7-6, 6-4 in first round  A tearful Venus Williams walked out of her press conference on Monday after her first-round victory at Wimbledon, the American’s first match since her involvement in a fatal car accident in Florida that police allege she caused.  The No10 seed deflected a series of queries about the wrongful-death lawsuit filed on Thursday before she became overcome with emotion, prompting the moderator to request that journalists refrained from asking about the incident.  Venus Williams ‘at fault’ in fatal car crash, say Florida police Read more  “There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and – yeah. I’m completely speechless. It’s just – yeah, I mean, I’m just …” a visibly shaken Williams said, her voice trailing off.  The seven-times major champion then broke down in tears, stepping out into the hallway to gather herself with members of her team.  Williams returned after about five minutes to field five more questions, mostly related to her 7-6 (7), 6-4 win against Belgium’s Elise Mertens amid wildly fluctuating weather on No1 Court, as the sun‑splashed afternoon gave way to blustery conditions and ultimately rain.  The American – at 37 the oldest woman in the draw here – was at her imperious best in the opening stages, breaking Mertens in her opening service game and dictating points with her serve. But Mertens, who was not born when Williams turned professional and only four when she won the first of her five Wimbledon singles titles, overcame those initial nerves and began challenging Williams with powerful groundstrokes into the corners and well-concealed variety.  Mertens blinked during the first-set tiebreak, then surrendered her early service break in the second. Rain interrupted play with the 21-year-old, who had just saved her second match point with a gorgeous backhand lob, serving at 3-5, 40-40 in the second set.  After a 33-minute delay Williams finished the job, uncorking an overhead smash to see off Mertens after an hour and 40 minutes and booking a second-round match against China’s Qiang Wang.  The American flashed her familiar smile after meeting her opponent at the net but it became clear during the press conference that her 20th appearance at the tournament she has won five times will be loaded with emotion.  “You can’t prepare for everything,” Williams said. “I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. That’s all I can say about it. That’s what I’ve learned.”  Palm Beach Gardens police said witnesses told investigators that Williams ran a red light in her Toyota Sequoia SUV at around 1pm on 9 June, injuring 79-year-old Jerome Barson, who died 13 days later. Barson was riding in the passenger seat when the Hyundai Accent driven by his wife, Linda, crashed into the side of Williams’s vehicle.  Williams told investigators she entered the six-lane intersection on a green light but was forced to stop midway through because of traffic ahead of her, failing to see the Barsons’ car when she continued through at about 5mph.  But police concluded the driver of Williams’s car “is at fault for violating the right of way”. Linda Barson, 68, also sustained injuries, including “a cracked sternum, shattered right arm, broken wrist, hand and fingers”.  Williams made her first public comments on the incident in a Facebook post on Friday night, describing herself as “heartbroken”.  One of only two former Wimbledon champions in the women’s field, Williams has a promising draw and perhaps a renewed ambition after her inspired run to the Australian Open final in January – a remarkable feat given the incurable autoimmune disease that has hamstrung her game for most of the decade.",0

"We’ve got people in charge of important shit who don’t believe in science, the actor said Thursday night in Los Angeles.  Harrison Ford got political on Thursday night at 3Labs in Culver City when he was honored by Conservation International, a nonprofit environmental group he has been involved with for 26 years.  ""We face an unprecedented moment in this country. Today's greatest threat is not climate change, not pollution, not flood or fire,"" Ford said during his acceptance speech of the Founders' Award. ""It's that we've got people in charge of important shit who don't believe in science.""  He went on to criticize those politicians who let ""political or economic self-interest denigrate or belittle sound scientific understanding of the causes and effects of human pressure on the environment.""  Ford serves as executive vice chair of Conservation International, which celebrated its 30th anniversary at the event. The group aims to protect nature and specifically focused on a 'No Forests, No Future' theme at the gala, highlighting the Amazon rainforest and its importance in addressing climate change.  ""I'm here tonight for one reason: I care deeply for the natural world. It's not about me, it's not about me at all, it's about this other world we're going to leave behind,"" the actor said. ""If we don't stop the destruction of nature, nothing else will matter.

If we end the ability of a healthy natural world to sustain humanity nothing else will matter, simply said.""  Ford has been deeply involved in the environmental cause for several decades, meeting with lawmakers, businesses and communities to discuss how to improve conservation policy and practices.  ""Other than my family, doing this work has been the most important thing of my life,"" he said. ""Nature doesn't need people, people need nature.""

Conservation International showed its virtual reality film Under the Canopy as well, giving guests a real-life look into the Amazon.  ""If you protect tropical forests, if you end tropical forest deforestation, it would be the equivalent of basically taking every car in the planet and making it into a Tesla overnight, that's how important it is. The epicenter of that is the Amazon,"" said M. Sanjayan, the group's CEO and an environmental news analyst.  Conservation International launched the largest tropical forest restoration project in the world this year as a result, and Ford will have continued involvement in these worldwide environmental projects.

The American singer, 33, was said to be open to offers of $8.95 million (£6,741,274) for the Mediterranean style property, which encompasses a four bedroom house, guest house, security building, separate fitness studio and an enormous outdoor pool.  Katy originally listed the sprawling home 13-months ago, but a lack of offers is understood to have resulted in a modest reduction on its original $9.285 million valuation.  Despite the marginally lower price, Katy is still set to make a modest profit from the property she purchased from heiress Aileen Getty for $8.2 million.

"Ashton Kutcher’s world has been turned upside down amidst the sexual misconduct allegations against his friend, Danny Masterson. Masterson has since been fired from Netflix’s ‘The Ranch’.  Ashton Kutcher, 39, is still processing the numerous rape allegations that have been made against his friend and The Ranch co-star Danny Masterson, 41. Masterson has since been fired by Netflix from the show in which he and Kutcher both work on. “Ashton has been rocked by the firing of his friend Danny,” a source close to Kutcher tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He doesn’t want to believe any of the accusations against his longtime friend, but he does hope the truth will come out.” However, Kutcher knew he had to do what was best for everyone involved. “As one of the executives on the show, Ashton is agreeing to swift action being taken. He is trying to protect the show and jobs of others working on the project. He just feels horrible about the whole situation.” Kutcher has yet to release an official statement following the allegations of misconduct against Masterson.  Mila Kunis, 34, in That 70’s Show. And, as we previously reported, the news shocked Kunis as well. Kutcher has been Masterson is also known for starring alongside Kutcher and his wife,, 34, in That 70’s Show. And, as we previously reported, the news shocked Kunis as well. Kutcher has been leaning on his wife since the cast shake up on The Ranch. The show — which is reportedly on the brink of wrapping the first 10 episodes of its third season — made the decision to move forward without Masterson on Dec. 5. “As a result of ongoing discussions, Netflix and the producers have written Danny Masterson out of ‘The Ranch’,” the entertainment company said in a statement to our sister site Deadline . “Yesterday was his last day on the show, and production will resume in early 2018 without him.” It’s unclear exactly how Masterson’s character, Rooster, will be written out of the series.  A rep for Masterson released the following statement to HollywoodLife.com shortly after the news broke: “I am obviously very disappointed in Netflix’s decision to write my character off of The Ranch. From day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me. Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit. I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all. In the meantime, I want to express my gratitude to the cast and crew that I’ve worked so closely with over the past three seasons. I wish them nothing but success. I am also so thankful to the fans that have supported me and continue to do so.”  HollywoodLifers, are you shocked over the allegations against Danny Masterson?",0
"Both on- and off-screen the stars of Bravo's Real Housewives franchise never cease to surprise their fans. If you're in need of even more of a shock factor from the women, then here are a handful of people you never knew the Real Housewives have dated. Now that many of the Housewives are married with families, viewers don't often get to hear about their past relationships. Of course, there is the exception for those who can't help but brag about whether or not they've dated a celebrity. Do you really think Real Housewives of New York City's Sonja Morgan would pass up that chance?  Surprisingly, the women of the Real Housewives have dated, or at least been linked to, many famous people. And the following list of men is actually quite impressive. It includes some extremely talented actors and singers. I mean, one of the women dated George Clooney and another one dated Nick Lachey. It’s crazy, right?  Rather than continuing to tease you with names, let’s get to it. Here are 13 famous individuals you probably had no idea some of the Real Housewives stars once dated. Don’t say I didn’t warn you about the surprises that are ahead.  1. George Clooney  MOLLY RILEY/AFP/Getty Images  Can you believe Clooney is connected to one of the Housewives? To be exact, he dated Real Housewives of New York City's Carole Radziwill, or so she revealed during an episode. ""We dated literally during the Eisenhower administration,"" she said. Radziwill even called him ""lovely.""  2. Ralph Fiennes  Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  In addition to Clooney, Radziwill also dated Ralph Fiennes. She opened up about their one-time summer romance to Us Weekly in July 2014 and said, ""It was long ago and far away … over a summer I was living in London."" As for whether or not a particular passage in her book The Widow's Guide to Sex and Dating is about her romance with Fiennes, it is not. ""[But] our relationship was not the basis for a storyline in my novel,"" she told Us. ""But like most fiction, stories are a pinch of the writer's experience and a part their imagination.""  3. Nick Lachey  Noam Galai/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Former Real Housewives of Orange County star Lizzie Rovsek once dated Nick Lachey. During a July 2014 Watch What Happens Live airing, Andy Cohen brought up to Rovsek how the 98 Degrees singer once revealed in an elevator during a WWHL appearance that he dated the Housewife. Per Cohen, Lachey said, ""Oh my god. This woman that I used to date is about to be an Orange County Housewife."" After Cohen asked Rovsek on WWHL, ""You dated him both pre and post Jessica [Simpson], right?"" she answered, ""Yes.""  4. Russell Simmons  Vivien Killilea/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Russell Simmons hasn't dated only one Housewife, but two Housewives. During a Season 1 Real Housewives of Potomac episode, Katie Rost revealed she dated Simmons. Things did not end well between them, as she documented in some breakup blogs, but despite any drama, they are actually friends.  According to Bravo, the other Bravolebrity the Def Jam co-founder dated is none other than Real Housewives of Atlanta star Cynthia Bailey. Actually, Bravo reports that Bailey's ex-husband Peter Thomas revealed to Essence in November 2010 that Simmons even proposed to her, but Bailey turned him down.  5. Ben Stiller  Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  This one might come as a huge shock: Ben Stiller dated Brandi Glanville. I repeat, Ben Stiller dated Brandi Glanville in the '90s. During a February 2016 WWHL appearance Stiller said about dating the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, ""It was short-lived and it was fun. I wouldn't characterize it as a relationship. It was a couple of dates, and fun.""  Apparently, there has been speculation that Glanville dated Stiller ever since her 2014 book, Drinking and Dating, was released. Per SheKnows, she describes a comedian without naming his name and says he was a ""height-challenged up-and-coming comedian."" SheKnows reports she also writes, ""He had the kind of face you remember. Sharp features, thick dark hair and a goofy grin."" It's unclear if this exact passage is about Stiller, but it sure seems likely.  6. Gerard Butler  Emma McIntyre/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  They may have not seriously dated, but Gerard Butler is connected to Brandi Glanville. The former Housewife appeared on WWHL in January 2012, where she dished that Butler is the most famous person she's ever had sex with besides her ex-husband, Eddie Cibrian. She called it ""a week of fun"" and gave Butler an ""11"" on his bedroom skills. However, when approached by TMZ in January 2012, Butler responded to Glanville's claims by asking, ""Who's Brandi Glanville?""  However, Butler confirmed he did have sex with Glanville to Howard Stern (via New York Daily News) in March 2013. His story differs from the Bravolebrity's, because according to him, they spent only an afternoon together rather than a week. ""It was a one-afternooner, but it was fun."" He added, ""She is wild."" As for why he seemingly pretended not to know her, he said, ""You know what I said, 'Who's Brandi Glanville?,"" because I didn't know her last name, didn't know she was a celebrity, didn't know she was going to run out and f*cking tell everyone about it!""  He confronted her about it and she told Cohen on WWHL in March 2013, ""We had a little texting today, and I think he's a doll and I feel bad for what I said. He is lovely and I appreciate him making it right.""  7. C. Thomas Howell  Rick Diamond/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  If you ever wanted to know who RHOBH star Kyle Richards lost her virginity to, here you go. C. Thomas Howell was her first boyfriend and they dated for five years. Richards confirmed to Andy Cohen on his Sirius XM radio show in December 2015 that her first time having sex was with Howell. However, she didn't really want to talk about it and said, ""Oh my God, this is so awkward. I'm so glad my husband isn't here right now.""  8. Julio Iglesias  RONALDO SCHEMIDT/AFP/Getty Images  Of course former reality star Yolanda Hadid dated musician Julio Iglesias. In a March 2015 RHOBH episode, Hadid told her co-stars while eating at an Amsterdam restaurant, ""I used to date Julio Iglesias, don't know if you guys know him, but when I was dating him 30 years ago, he was the one who brought me here for the first time."" If you want to see a photo of the two in 1986, click here.  9. Jensen Ackles  Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Did you know a Supernatural star apparently dated a Real Housewives of Miami star? Based on these photos from Getty Images, Jensen Ackles and Joanna Krupa seem to have once been an item. The kiss and the hand holding sure make it seem like they dated at one point in time. Seeing as the majority of the photos were taken in 2005, they most likely dated 12 years ago.  10. Billy Idol  Mike Windle/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  If anyone has a long list of famous men they once dated, it's RHONY's Sonja Morgan. In May 2011, she told Paper magazine that she dated Billy Idol. Morgan said, ""I went out with Billy for a while. That was nice."" She then added, ""It was scary because he was dating Perry Lister, she had red hair and was like six feet tall. He's a vegetarian and a very nice man."" It's unclear if she dated Idol at the same time as Lister.  Though, in April 2011, Morgan told the New York Post that ""there were some Billy Idol days,"" after being asked about her past boyfriends. She then added, ""Dating is a strong word for some people."" Who knows if she and Idol were serious or not.  11. Matt Dillon  VALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images  Next for Morgan is actor Matt Dillon. She also told Paper magazine, ""Yeah, we had one whole date. Then he left me to go with another girl. It's an experience and it's fun."" That's all we know about this supposed date between Morgan and Dillon, but who else wants to hear more details?  12. Owen Wilson  Jeff Spicer/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  While appearing on WWHL in April 2015, Morgan revealed she dated Owen Wilson. She didn't elaborate any further than saying they dated. In January 2013, Morgan chatted with Star Pulse and said the following about Wilson, ""My celebrity crushes are the kooky, fun and quirky guys. Men like Owen Wilson, who I’ve had a flirt with, as he’s cute and brilliant.""  13. Eric Clapton  Larry Busacca/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  During her April 2015 WWHL appearance, Morgan also confirmed she dated Eric Clapton. In a June 2012 RHONY episode, Morgan actually brought up Clapton's name after Aviva Drescher pulled out a bag holding one of her prosthetic legs. She said, ""I know that bag, Eric Clapton used to bring it to lunch then we'd go play pool."" Before that, in a May 2011 blog post for Bravo, Morgan mentioned Clapton and wrote, ""I was introduced to several good restaurants by my dear old friend Eric Clapton. Boy did we have a great time.""  There you have it. Some of the Real Housewives sure have a history with many famous faces.",0
"EVERY WEEKDAY MORNING, DailyEdge.ie rounds up the best of the day’s celebrity dirt from the top to the very bottom.  Source: SIPA USA/PA Images  Last week we learned that Tyga was struggling to come to terms with the fact that his ex-girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, was exceptionally close to securing billionaire status.  Apparently, the rapper felt that he should have a slice of the high life since he was in a relationship with Kylie when she launched her first lip kit back in 2015.  Source: Piovanotto Marco/PA Images  And this week, he’s stressed over the GQ photoshoot she did with her current partner and the father of her child, Travis Scott.  Speaking to HollywoodLife, a source close to Tyga spilled the deets.  Tyga feels crushed over another one of Kylie’s magazine covers. He feels heartbroken over her latest GQ cover with Travis.  🖤 A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Jul 17, 2018 at 11:34am PDT  He’s in a right heap over it, apparently.  Tyga misses Kylie and feels like that should have been him making gorgeous babies with Kylie, doing interviews and posing with her for photo shoots and magazine covers. Last week’s Forbes cover was like a punch in the gut and now this GQ cover with Travis is only making missing Kylie worse and more painful.  According to sources, the rapper couldn’t even bring himself to open the pages of the publication.  He doesn’t like seeing her with Travis’s arms wrapped around her and he does not want to read the interview either.  Sorry to hear that, Tyga.  Source: Ian West  Katy Perry says she was heartbroken over public reaction to her last album  In a candid interview with Vogue Australia, Katy Perry revealed that she suffered bouts of situational depression due to public reaction to the release of her latest album, Witness.  I have had bouts of situational depression and my heart was broken last year because, unknowingly, I put so much validity in the reaction of the public.  About last night ♏️ 💜#americanidolfinale A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on May 22, 2018 at 1:22pm PDT  The 33-year-old admitted that she was left heartbroken by the response to the album, which saw the release of Chained to the Rhythm and Swish Swish.  The public didn’t react in the way I had expected to … which broke my heart.  The singer reveals she sought help from the Hoffman Institute, a California-based personal growth retreat, after seeing how much her friends gained from time spent there.  For years, my friends would go and come back completely rejuvenated, and I wanted to go, too. I was ready to let go of anything that was holding me back from being my ultimate self. Fair play, Perry.  Source: PA Archive/PA Images  Calum Best had his say on online trolling while appearing on Lorraine  Calum Best has urged members of the public to reconsider their attitude towards reality TV stars, given the level of trolling which takes place online during the broadcast of certain series.  Source: Doug Peters/PA Images  Using Love Island as an example, Calum, who appeared on Lorraine today, began by saying he understands why the line is often blurred.  I know it can be light hearted and fun because realistically Love Island is a fun show.  Calum, who won Celebrity Love Island in 2006, spoke of his own experience, while acknowledging that not everyone is robust enough to cope with the court of public opinion in the aftermath.  You go out there and there’re awkward love moments and it’s all quite fun but you have to think about if people are getting trolled and nasty things are being said and they don’t know how to cope with that, that can mess them up.  Source: Hugh Macknight/PA Images  Referring to the late Sophie Gradon, who appeared on Love Island in 2016, and died last month, Calum said:  Poor Sophie, she was a friend of mine and to think she was struggling on the inside because of what people might have said or how she was being treated – it’s a horrible thought and that can happen to anybody.  The 37-year-old acknowledges that trolling on social media is almost unavoidable, but is keen to raise awareness of the implications of certain online behaviour.  I know there are memes out there and it can be quite funny and we all have a laugh, but can you imagine if somebody isn’t confident or somebody lacks self belief and they start seeing all these horrible things written about them.  Definitely something to think about.

"Edward Norton’s company is being sued by residents of a building destroyed in a fire last week which tragically killed a firefighter.  On Tuesday, as friends and family attended the funeral of the firefighter killed in the blaze, two residents filed a suit against the actor’s production company, Class 5 Films, and the owner of the apartment building, Vincent Sollazzo-Lampkin, after they claimed the production company knew about the fire that had broken out but did not warn residents.  The company and the building owner are being sued for $7 million, according to court documents obtained by The Blast.  In a statement provided to PEOPLE at the time, the film’s producers said their crew noticed smoke and immediately began alerting the residents of the building.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Our production was towards the end of our working day and had dozens of people working on site, when our crew noticed that smoke was coming into our set and into other parts of the building from below us,” read the statement. “As soon as we noticed smoke coming up into our set, our crew immediately alerted the fire department and began alerting residents of the building even as we evacuated our cast and crew.”  The production company had not been served with the lawsuit by the deadline, so was unable to comment.  Edward Norton Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  Erica and George Cruz filed the suit claiming the production company kept “highly flammable equipment” in the basement of their Harlem building while filming Motherless Brooklyn. The two also claimed that representatives of Class 5 Films were aware of the fire that broke out on March 22 but did not let residents of the building know.  “When representatives of Class 5, Inc. became aware of the fire, they did not warn the tenants in the building… in fact, they misled the tenants into believing there had been a fire that had been extinguished,” the complaint states.  Sollazzo-Lampkin’s attorney, Geovanny Fernandez, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Cruzes’ apartment building was completely destroyed, causing them to be displaced and lose multiple personal items such as clothes, important documents and the loss of their rent-controlled apartment, their lawsuit says.  The fire allegedly exacerbated Erica’s asthma and caused her severe emotional distress as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and nightmares.  The Cruzes also claim the fire was caused by “reckless, careless and negligent” maintenance of the building such as failing to have fire extinguishers or working smoke detectors.  In a statement provided to PEOPLE at the time, the film’s producers offered “deepest condolences” to the family of Michael R. Davidson, who lost his life.  “Our production was towards the end of our working day and had dozens of people working on site, when our crew noticed that smoke was coming into our set and into other parts of the building from below us,” read the statement. “As soon as we noticed smoke coming up into our set, our crew immediately alerted the fire department and began alerting residents of the building even as we evacuated our cast and crew.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

"American actress  Sarah Michelle Gellar[2][3] (born April 14, 1977)[4] is an American actress, producer, and entrepreneur. After being spotted by an agent at the age of four in New York City, she made her acting debut in the made-for-television film An Invasion of Privacy (1983). Her television breakthrough came in 1993, when she originated the role of Kendall Hart on the ABC daytime soap opera All My Children, winning the 1995 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series.  Gellar received widespread recognition for her portrayal of Buffy Summers on the WB series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003), which earned her five Teen Choice Awards and a Golden Globe Award nomination, and became recognized as one of the greatest female characters in U.S. television.[5][6] Her most successful films, in terms of box office receipts, are I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Scream 2 (1997), Cruel Intentions (1999), Scooby-Doo (2002), Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), and The Grudge (2004).[7] Other film roles include Harvard Man (2001), Southland Tales (2007) and The Air I Breathe (2008). She headlined the television series Ringer (2011–2012) and The Crazy Ones (2013–2014).  In 2015, Gellar, along with Galit Laibow and Greg Fleishman, founded Foodstirs, a food crafting brand and e-commerce startup selling baking kits,[8] and in 2017, she released her cook book Stirring Up Fun with Food.  Family and education [ edit ]  Gellar was born in Long Island. She is the only child of Rosellen (née Greenfield), a nursery school teacher, and Arthur Gellar, a garment worker.[9] Both of her parents were Jewish, though Gellar's family also had a Christmas tree during her childhood.[10][11] In 1984, when she was seven, her parents divorced and she was raised by her mother on the city's Upper East Side.[12] While growing up with her mother, she lost contact with her father, from whom she remained estranged until his death in 2001;[13][14][15] she once described him as ""non-existent"",[16] and in the early 2000s, she stated: ""My father, you can just say, is not in the picture. I'm not being deliberately evasive about him, it's just that there's so little to say.""[15][17][18] Besides being a working child at the time, Gellar was a competitive figure skater, finishing in third place at a New York State regional competition.[3] She also placed fourth at a Tae Kwon Do competition at Madison Square Garden (she was a black belt).[3]  Gellar was given a partial scholarship to study at the Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School,[3][19] as her mother was not able to pay full tuition, for which she was constantly bullied.[20] She said in an interview with The Independent: ""I was different and that's the one thing you can't be at school, because you're ostracised. I didn't have the money these kids had"".[21] Gellar was not present in class for most of the time at the school as she had to work in several acting projects simultaneously, recalling that she ""had more absences in the first month than you're supposed to have for an entire year. I was telling them that I had back problems and had to go to the doctor the whole time"".[3] Gellar then briefly attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, but dropped out due to acting obligations; the teachers threatened to fail her because of her constant absence from classes as she was busy going to auditions, despite earning good grades.[3] Gellar graduated from the Professional Children's School,[3][22][23] in 1994 as a ""straight A"" student with a 4.0 grade average.[24][25][26] As Gellar spent significant time working on All My Children while ""trying to graduate"",[27] the majority of her senior year was completed through guided study.[28]  Career [ edit ]  Early credits and prominence (1981–1996) [ edit ]  At the age of four, she was spotted by an agent in a restaurant in Upper Manhattan.[29] Two weeks later, she auditioned for a part in the television film An Invasion of Privacy, with Valerie Harper, Carol Kane and Jeff Daniels. At the audition, Gellar read both her own lines and those of Harper, impressing the directors enough to cast her in the role.[3] The film aired on CBS in January 1983.[30] She subsequently appeared in a controversial television commercial for Burger King, in which her character criticized McDonald's and claimed to eat only at Burger King.[31] The ad led to a lawsuit by McDonald's, naming Gellar and banning her from eating at the food chain;[32][33] she recalled in a 2004 interview: ""I wasn’t allowed to eat there. It was tough because, when you’re a little kid, McDonald’s is where all your friends have their birthday parties, so I missed out on a lot of apple pies.""[34][35] While growing up, Gellar also worked as a model for Wilhemina and acted in numerous television commercials.[3][36]  During the 1980s, Gellar played minor roles in the films Over the Brooklyn Bridge (1984), Funny Farm (1988) and High Stakes (1989),[37][38][39] and also guest starred in various television series, such as Spenser: For Hire and Crossbow. At the age of nine, she appeared alongside Matthew Broderick and Eric Stoltz in the Broadway production The Widow Claire.[3][40][41] She served briefly as a co-host of the teen girl talk show Girl Talk, which aired in 1989.[42] In 1991, she was cast as a young Jacqueline Bouvier in A Woman Named Jackie, starring Roma Downey. The miniseries won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series.  Gellar next took on the leading role in the 1992 syndicated teen serial Swans Crossing, which chronicled the lives of a group of wealthy teenagers. The series ran for one season and earned Gellar two Young Artist Award nominations, for Best Young Actress in a New Television Series and for Best Young Actress in an Off-Primetime Series.[43] She made her debut in the soap opera All My Children in 1993, playing Kendall Hart, the long-lost daughter of character Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). As she got the role, Gellar was complimented as having the acting talent and the ""forceful personality"" needed to go up against Lucci's experience; Kendall was supposed to be like a younger version of Erica.[44] Her stint on the show was successful as ""longtime fans of the soap saw her as the second coming of Erica"".[45] Writers showcased her more after her initial reception and she became a household name to the soap opera medium.[45] In 1995, at the age of eighteen, she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for the role.[46] The same year, Gellar left the show to pursue other acting opportunities.[47][48]  Worldwide recognition (1997–2003) [ edit ]  Gellar moved to Los Angeles following her departure from All My Children, and in 1996, she read the script for Joss Whedon's television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which follows Buffy Summers, a teenager burdened with the responsibility of fighting occult foes and supernatural occurrences. She screen tested several times originally for the role of Cordelia Chase,[49] but after approaching Whedon and producers about playing Buffy Summers, she auditioned again and was eventually cast in the title role.[3][50] The show premiered in March 1997, to widespread critical and popular acclaim,[51] and Gellar's Buffy, created to subvert the stereotypical female horror movie victim,[52] went on to become recognized as one of the 100 greatest female characters in U.S. television.[5][6] Buffy ran for seven seasons (144 episodes),[53][54] and during its broadcast, earned Gellar five Teen Choice Awards, the Saturn Award for Best Genre Television Actress and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Drama.[55] She sang during the series' musical episode ""Once More, with Feeling"", which spawned an original cast album, released in 2002.[56][57]  During the early airing of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gellar made her first major film appeareances in two successful slasher films. In I Know What You Did Last Summer, opposite Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze, Jr, she took on the role of an ill-fated aspiring beauty actress.[58] Budgeted at US$17 million, the movie made US$125 million globally.[59][60][61] Washington Post found the cast to be ""solid"",[62] in what San Francisco Chronicle described as a ""competent but uninspired"" film.[63] For her part, Gellar earned a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actress – Horror and a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance.[64][65] In Scream 2 (also 1997),[66] Gellar played a likewise ill-fated vain character, this time that of a Sorority sister. She filmed her scenes in-between shots of Buffy and had only recently finished work on I Know What You Did Last Summer. Despite the hectic scheduling, she agreed to perform in Scream 2 without having read the script, on the basis of the success of the first film.[67] Scream 2 grossed over US$172 million worldwide.[68][69]  In 1998, Gellar hosted for the first time Saturday Night Live,[70][71] and provided the voice of the Gwendy Doll in Small Soldiers, a moderate commercial success.[72][73] Gellar also had her first appearance on the 'Most Beautiful' list by People magazine, which cemented her ""It girl"" status at the time.[27] In 1999, she had a cameo appearance in the sleeper hit She's All That,[74] and took on the lead role of a struggling restaurant owner in the critically panned romantic comedy Simply Irresistible.[75][76] Gellar once called it ""bad choice"",[77] but Roger Ebert, on the other hand, found her to be ""lovely"" in what he described as an ""old-fashioned"" comedy.[78] In Cruel Intentions (1999), a modern-day retelling of Les Liaisons dangereuses, Gellar played Kathryn Merteuil, a brunette cocaine addict with an appetite for manipulating people.[79] The US$10 million film was a hit at the box office, grossing USUS$75 million worldwide.[80][81][82][83][84][85] Roger Ebert felt that she is ""effective as a bright girl who knows exactly how to use her act as a tramp"",[86] and in an interview with Chicago Tribune, director Roger Kumble, describing her work in the movie, said: ""She unquestionably is the most professional actor I ever worked with"".[3] Gellar and co-star Selma Blair obtained the ""Best Kiss"" award at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards.[87][88][89] Around that time, she guest starred in three episodes of Angel and appeared as Debbie in the HBO series Sex and the City episode ""Escape from New York"".  Gellar played the daughter of a mobster in James Toback's independent drama Harvard Man,[90] which premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.[91] While the film found a limited release in theaters,[92] Gellar's performance in it, along with Cruel Intentions, helped her shed her good girl image.[93] Gellar portrayed Daphne Blake in the live action–comedy Scooby-Doo, directed by Raja Gosnell and alongside Freddie Prinze, Jr., Linda Cardellini and Matthew Lillard. Scooby-Doo made over US$275 million,[94] and became Gellar's most widely seen film to date.[7][95] She won the Teen Choice Award in the category of Choice Movie Actress – Comedy for her part in the picture.[96] Alongside Jack Black, she hosted the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, which attracted 7.1 million viewers on its June 6 broadcast, achieving the show's highest rating ever at the time.[97][98]  During her growing film career, Gellar continued work on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but she left the show after the seventh season. When asked why, she explained, ""This isn't about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater – it's more of a personal decision. I need a rest.""[99][100][101][102] In her feature in Esquire magazine Gellar expressed her pride for her work on Buffy, ""I truly believe that it is one of the greatest shows of all time and it will go down in history as that. And I don't feel that that is a cocky statement. We changed the way that people looked at television.""[103]  Continued film roles (2004–2010) [ edit ]  After the end of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gellar provided her voice for the character Gina Vendetti in The Simpsons episode ""The Wandering Juvie"", which aired in March 2004. Her next film was Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), reprising the role of Daphne.[104] While IGN felt that both Gellar and Prinze ""exhibit marked improvements over their work in [2002's Scooby-Doo]"",[105] the film was a commercial success, grossing US$181.4 million around the globe.[106] In the horror remake The Grudge (also 2004), Gellar portrayed Karen Davis, an exchange student living and working in Tokyo who becomes exposed to a mysterious supernatural curse. Critic Rob Blackwelder wrote that she ""played her part well, and her fear and disorientation are terrifically enhanced by the decision to keep the [original] setting in this remake"".[107] The film was a major box office hit,[108][109] grossing more than US$110 million in the US, and US$187 million worldwide.[110][111][112] She received a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Frightened Performance as well as a nomination for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress – Thriller for her role.[113][114] Since 2005, she has voiced several characters in 13 episodes of the animated television series Robot Chicken, as of 2018.  Gellar starred opposite Dwayne Johnson, Seann William Scott, and Justin Timberlake in Richard Kelly's Southland Tales (2006), as an adult film star working on creating a reality television show. Gellar had met with Kelly and was drawn to the original ideas for the movie, accepting the role before she even read the script.[115][116][117][118] The film found a limited audience in theaters,[119] but J. Hoberman for Village Voice remarked that the director ""contrives two memorable comic performances"" by Gellar and Johnson. In 2006, Gellar also briefly reprised her role of Karen in the critically panned sequel The Grudge 2,[120][121][122] and starred in the psychological thriller The Return, as a businesswoman haunted by memories of her childhood and the mysterious death of a young woman.[123] The film was a critical and commercial failure, grossing only US$11 million.[124][125] The New York Times called it a ""career stagnation"".[126]  In 2007, Gellar voiced Ella in the poorly received animated film Happily N'Ever After,[127] and also April O'Neil in TMNT, which made US$95 million.[128][129] She starred in the romantic comedy Suburban Girl and the drama The Air I Breathe, both of which were screened at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.[130] In Suburban Girl, alongside Alec Baldwin, she took the role of a New York City editor and the love interest of a much older influential man (Baldwin). The film was released for DVD in January 2008.[131] In the likewise little-seen film The Air I Breathe, Gellar appeared with Forest Whitaker, Brendan Fraser and Kevin Bacon, portraying an up-and-coming pop singer.[132][133] The New York Times called it a ""gangster movie with delusions of grandeur"",[134] while DVD Talk noted that ""her character here has the deepest emotional arc, and she hits all the right notes.""[135]  Possession, a psycological thriller Gellar filmed in 2006, saw her play a lawyer whose life is thrown into chaos after a car accident sends her husband (Michael Landes) and brother-in-law (Lee Pace) into comas. Due to financial problems at Yari Film Group,[136][137][138] the film went to DVD in March 2010.[139] In the film adaptation Veronika Decides to Die,[140][141] Gellar starred as a young depressed woman who rediscovers the joy in life when she finds out that she only has days to live following a suicide attempt. Like Possession, the film failed to find a proper release in North American theaters, and was released for VOD in 2015.[142][143][144][145] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter found the actress to be ""reasonably compelling"" in what he called a ""ponderous and silly misfire"".[146]  Return to television (2011–present) [ edit ]  Gellar took a two-year hiatus from acting following the birth of her daughter in 2009, and in 2011, she signed to star and work as executive producer for a new drama titled Ringer, in which she played the dual role of twin sisters, one of whom is on the run and manages to hide by assuming the wealthy life of the other. Gellar has stated that part of her decision to return to a television series was because it allowed her to both work and raise her child.[147][148][149] The series received positive reviews from critics;[150] E! Online found her to be ""awesome"" and ""fantastic"",[151] while TV Line felt she ""does a fine job"" as both characters.[152] Ringer went on to have a large fan base,[153][154] but it was canceled after the first season.[155] For her portrayal, she received several award nominations, including one for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Television Actress – Drama.[156][157]  In September 2011, Gellar returned as a guest star on the ABC soap opera All My Children before the show's ending but not as Kendall Hart;[158] she portrayed a patient at Pine Valley Hospital who tells Maria Santos that she is ""Erica Kane's daughter"", and states that she saw vampires before they became trendy—a reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She voiced a character in the American Dad! episode ""Virtual In-Stanity"",[159][160] and again for the December 6, 2012 episode (""Adventures in Hayleysitting"").[161] On September 30, 2012, she reprised her role of Gina Vendetti in the premiere episode of The Simpsons' season 24.[162][163]  A fan of Robin Williams for years, once Gellar learned that he was making the single-camera television series The Crazy Ones, she contacted her friend Sarah de Sa Rego, the wife of Williams' best friend, Bobcat Goldthwait, in order to lobby for a co-starring role.[164] She obtained the part of an advertising director who runs an agency with her father.[165][166] Digital Spy felt that Williams ""shares a warm, genuine chemistry with his on-screen offspring Gellar,""[167] as part of a mixed critical response.[168] Like Ringer, the series was canceled after one season,[169][170] but earned Gellar the People's Choice Award for Favorite Actress in a New Television Series.[171]  In March 2015, Gellar guest-starred as Cinderella in Whitney Avalon's official YouTube channel video short Princess Rap Battle,[172] and joined the cast of Star Wars Rebels for season two,[173] playing a recurring character known as the Seventh Sister.[174] In early 2016, Gellar filmed for NBC a pilot presentation for a potential television series based on the cult-classic film, Cruel Intentions, reprising her role of Kathryn Merteuil. The pilot was ultimately not picked up to series.[175][176]  Public image [ edit ]  Wax statue of Sarah Michelle Gellar at Madame Tussauds in London  Gellar has appeared on the covers and photo sessions of numerous magazines during her career. In February 1998, she appeared in Seventeen,[177] and in subsequent years the list has grown to include Nylon, Marie Claire, Vogue, Glamour, Esquire, Allure, Cosmopolitan, FHM, Rolling Stone and Elle among others.[178][179][180][181] In 1999, Gellar signed on to be the face of Maybelline – becoming the company's first celebrity spokeswoman since Lynda Carter in the late 1970s.[182][183] She was honored with a Woman of The Year Award by Glamour magazine in October 2002,[184] and in the same year, her wax figure by Madame Tussauds, was unveiled as part of the ""Trail of Vampires"" exhibition.[185]  With her work in Buffy and mainstream movies such as Cruel Intentions, Gellar became a household name and a sex symbol across the globe, status she cemented with being a feature several times in the annual Maxim ""Hot 100"" list between 2002 and 2008.[186][187][188][189] Wearing a black lace bra, she was on the cover of the December 2007 issue of Maxim and was named the 2009 Woman of the Year by the magazine.[190] She was voted number 1 in FHM's edition of ""100 Sexiest Women"" of 1999, and was featured in its 2005 list.[191] She had also been in the magazine's German, Dutch, South African, Danish and Romanian editions of the 100 Sexiest Women list every year from 1998 onwards.[192] Topsocialite.com listed her as the 8th Sexiest woman of the 90s along with Alicia Silverstone, Gillian Anderson and Shannen Doherty.[193]  She was featured in Google's Top 10 Women Searches of 2002 and 2003, coming in at No. 8,[194] and was included in UK Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sex Symbols in 2007, ranking at No. 16.[195] Other appearances and listings include: Entertainment Weekly ranked her in its Top 100 TV Icons in 2007, and placed her No. 3 in its Top 12 Entertainers of the Year in 1998, and Glamour ranked her in its 50 Best Dressed Women in the World 2004 and 2005 at Nos. 17 and 24, respectively.[192] BuddyTV ranked her No. 27 on TV's 100 Sexiest Women of 2011 list, as well.[196]  She has appeared in ""Got Milk?"" ads as well as in the Stone Temple Pilots music video ""Sour Girl"" and Marcy Playground's ""Comin' Up From Behind"".[197][198][199] Gellar was featured on the cover of Gotham and their main story in the March 2008 issue, in which she spoke about how her style has evolved since she passed 30. Gellar said: ""It sounds clichéd, but when women turn 30, they find themselves. You become more comfortable in your own skin. Last night on Letterman, I wore this skintight Herve Leger dress. Two years ago, three years ago? I would never have worn it.""[200]  Other endeavors [ edit ]  Charitable activities [ edit ]  Gellar is an active advocate for various charities, including breast cancer research, Project Angel Food, Habitat for Humanity and CARE. Of her charitable pursuits, she says, ""I started because my mother taught me a long time ago that even when you have nothing, there's ways to give back. And what you get in return for that is tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn't do a lot. I couldn't do much more than just donate money when I was on [Buffy] because there wasn't time. And now that I have the time, it's amazing.""[201]  In 1999, she went to the Dominican Republic to help Habitat for Humanity's project of building homes for the residents;[3] Gellar recalled in an interview she had worked with the cause a lot, explaining: ""You actually get to physically do something, where you get to go and build these houses. I like working with things where you can directly affect someone in particular"".[201] With Project Angel Food, she delivered healthy meals to people infected with AIDS, and through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, she granted sick children's wishes of meeting her while working on Buffy.[201] In 2007, Gellar was featured in Vaseline's ""Skin Is Amazing"" campaign, with other actors such as Hilary Duff, Amanda Bynes and John Leguizamo.[202] She agreed to auction nude-posed photos of herself on eBay, to raise money for the Coalition of Skin Diseases, an organization which supports clinical research, fosters physician and patient education.[203][204]  In May 2011, Gellar joined ""The Nestlé Share the Joy of Reading Program"", which promotes reading to young children to encourage them to read during the summer break.[205][206] The following year, she was presented with the Tom Mankiewicz Leadership Award during the Beastly Ball at the Los Angeles Zoo.[207] The honor recognizes members of the entertainment community who have excelled in establishing meaningful and lasting programs that contribute to the welfare of the world's natural and civic environment.[208] In 2014 and 2015, Gellar hosted two fundraisers for Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA.[209][210][211]  Foodstirs [ edit ]  In October 2015, Gellar co-founded Foodstirs, a food crafting brand and e-commerce startup selling easy to make and organic baking kits for children and families.[8]  Cook book [ edit ]  Gellar released a cook book titled Stirring up Fun with Food on April 18, 2017. The book was co-authored by Gia Russo, and features numerous food crafting ideas.[212]  Personal life [ edit ]  Gellar met her future husband Freddie Prinze, Jr., while they were filming the 1997 teen horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer,[213] but the two did not begin dating until 2000. They were engaged in April 2001 and married in Mexico on September 1, 2002,[214] in a ceremony officiated by Adam Shankman, a director and choreographer with whom Gellar had worked on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Prinze and Gellar have worked together several times; they played each other's respective love interests as Fred and Daphne in the 2002 film Scooby-Doo and its sequel, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, and both provided their voices for the animated feature Happily N'Ever After (2007) and the animated series Star Wars Rebels.[215] In 2007, in honor of their fifth year of marriage, Gellar legally changed her name to Sarah Michelle Prinze.[2][3]  Together, Gellar and Prinze have two children, a daughter (Charlotte Grace) born September 2009 and a son (Rocky James) born September 2012.[216][217] The family lives in Los Angeles.[218]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Other works [ edit ]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]",0
"Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.",0
"Update: Sgt. Johnson's mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, has now spoken with The Washington Post, and she says Wilson's account is accurate. ""President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband,"" Jones-Johnson said. She said she was in the car at the time but declined to elaborate on the specifics of Wilson's claim.  A Democratic congresswoman says she was in the car with the widow of a soldier killed in Niger when President Trump made comments that upset the widow. Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (Fla.) says Trump told Myeshia Johnson that her husband, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, “knew what he signed up for.” Appearing on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” on Wednesday, Wilson added that the widow was in tears after the call and lamented that Trump “didn't even remember his name.”  And Trump has now hit back at the congresswoman, saying he has “proof” that her account is wrong.  Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017  Here's what we can say:  After-the-fact accounts can be flawed, and people can hear things in the worst possible way when they come from the mouths of their political opponents. Wilson may be totally honest in what she says, but if she believes Trump is a bad person, her recollection will not be charitable. If Trump has proof that Wilson is wrong, he needs to produce it immediately. The idea that Trump said this is — unfortunately — completely believable, given his track record of handling sensitive situations has ranged from awkward to offensive.  This is hardly the first time we've seen Trump wrapped up in a dispute involving a Gold Star family. In fact, it's the second day in a row in which Trump's comments about the relatives of dead service members have been at issue. On Monday, he suggested that his chief of staff, retired Marine general John Kelly, had not received a phone call from President Barack Obama after his son's death. White House officials have only elaborated on the matter anonymously.  Going back to the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump showed very little compunction about attacking the Khans, a Gold Star family that criticized him, and publicly questioned the war hero status of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a prisoner of war for seven years in Vietnam. While most politicians treat these matters very, very delicately — or steer clear of them altogether — Trump has repeatedly declined to do so. He has often proactively politicized them.  And whatever you think about Trump, displaying empathy is not his strong suit. The way he talks about tragedy is routinely awkward, at best, and tasteless, at worst. Puerto Rico is dealing with the fallout of a devastating hurricane, and Trump talks about how it will pay for the relief effort, suggests the island is at fault for its poor situation, and attacks San Juan's mayor. He turned a death during a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville from a tragedy into a political football when he blamed “both sides.” While in Florida for the Hurricane Irma relief effort, he seemed to be more reserved, but then he asked a man to attack Obama on camera. When Navy sailors were missing after a tanker collided with a destroyer near Singapore, Trump responded, “That’s too bad, too bad.” There are plenty more examples.  There is a tendency to think that some of this is just Trump being provocative and trying to rile up the media by pushing the boundaries of acceptable and presidential behavior. The simpler — and not mutually exclusive — alternative is that he just doesn't know how a president should act in these instances.  In this case, we have alleged Trump comments that were never meant for public consumption. If accurately relayed, they were just Trump being careless, not provocative. But they completely track with everything he has done and said publicly about tragedy before. It's not even difficult to imagine Trump saying these things at a lectern in the Rose Garden.  So again, it's worth waiting to see what “proof” Trump produces. But the benefit of the doubt went out the window a long time ago, and Trump has himself to blame.",1

"A recruitment video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)Last month, The Washington Post reported that white nationalists have begun using Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a recruitment tool.Now, the polarizing Republican presidential front-runner has become the recruitment fodder for another group of marginalized extremists.A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country, according to news reports. Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC.[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Donald Trump ‘is ISIS’s greatest triumph’]Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN.3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & ""concentration camps"" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui — Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016The clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.On either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported, are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.“Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: “The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.”The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.“ISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups — they don’t want Trump in office,” said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. “They want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.” ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is “scared to death of him.”“He’s a threat to them,” she said. “That’s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.”Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump’s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“I can’t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,” Simmons said. “The terrorists fear Trump right now. They’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States]The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to CNN.In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“I would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” Trump said in an interview on “Morning Joe.”Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology.

"It will be a huge lifestyle change. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pictured. Ben Birchall - WPA Pool/Getty Images  The royal wedding is (almost) upon us. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, about two years after they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend.  Markle's new life will look drastically different from her life before she met her future husband. Not only will she move from the United States to the United Kingdom and become a British citizen; she'll also transition from an acting career to being full-time royalty.  In the couple's first interview after announcing their engagement, Markle, who is 36 years old, addressed her decision: ""I don't see it as giving anything up, I just see it as a change.""  She added that she had already been working on the television series ""Suits"" for seven years. ""So we're very, very fortunate to be able to have that sort of longevity on a series and for me, once we hit the 100-episode marker, I thought, 'You know what? I have ticked this box and I feel really proud of the work I've done there and now it's time to, as you [Harry] said, work as a team with you.""  In addition to playing Rachel Zane on ""Suits,"" Markle also appeared on the soap opera ""General Hospital."" She's been everything from a United Nations women's advocate to a freelance calligrapher, and she recently shut down her lifestyle blog, ""The Tig.""  While nothing will expressly prohibit Markle from acting, INSIDER's Kristin Salaky and Talia Lakritz reported that royals are forbidden from being politically active and from publicly discussing their political views.  Markle and Prince Harry say they're on the same page about wanting to change the world  Markle's experience marrying into royalty isn't something most of us can relate to. But the general theme of making big life changes for your partner is universal.  As Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg frequently tells young women, ""The most important career choice you'll make is who you marry.""  Legendary investor Warren Buffett said much the same thing in a conversation with Bill Gates at Columbia University. He told the audience: ""The most important decision many of you will make, not all of you, will be the spouse you choose,"" since ""you will move in the direction of the people that you associate with.""  INSEAD professor Jennifer Petriglieri said on an episode of the Harvard Business Review's podcast ""Women at Work,"" that couples, in order to maximize both partners' satisfaction, should have a conversation twice yearly about what they're ""aiming for individually and together"" in the near future.  In fact, in the post-engagement interview, Markle mentioned that she and Prince Harry had had this type of conversation on an early date: ""It was really one of the first things we connected on, it was one of the first things we started talking about when we met, was just the different things that we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change.""  In the same interview, Prince Harry responded to a question about whether he feels a sense of responsibility for Markle leaving acting behind. ""Of course,"" he said, adding that, ""I still have to have some pretty frank conversations with her to say, you know what you're letting yourself in for, it's a big deal, and it's not easy for anybody.""  Prince Harry went on: ""Whatever we have to tackle together or individually, will always be us together as a team.""  More on the royal wedding:",0

What was even more perfect was to see my beautiful bride walking down the aisle. We are so thankful the Lord has brought us to this place and we can’t wait to begin our journey as husband and wife!”  Us exclusively revealed the duo’s engagement in March. “This is an exciting, big step in our lives and the whole thing was very meaningful,” the Counting On star, 21, said at the time of popping the question to Swanson, 18. “The place where I proposed to Lauren is the exact spot where her parents were engaged.

"Nicki Minaj had an awkward camel toe moment at the BET Awards on June 24 during her performance, however, Drake is here for it! We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why he loves the wardrobe malfunction and her style in general!  Drake is Nicki Minaj’s biggest fan! If you keep up with either rapper, you know they have quite a history. From their feud in the past, their rumored romance, Drake’s beef with Nicki’s ex-boyfriend Meek Mill, to their many collaborations including “No Frauds,” it’s clear these two are always going to be in each other’s lives. So, it’s no surprise that when everyone trolled Nicki for her unfortunate wardrobe malfunction at the BET Awards on June 24, Drake would come to her defense. “Drake thinks Nicki’s style and her camel toe are sexy AF. He thinks she is beautiful, talented, and confident enough to rock an outfit even if it highlights her camel toe,” a source close to Drake tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.  For those of you who need a refresher, it all happened when Nicki took the stage at the Staples Center to perform “Chun-Li” and “Rich Sex”. However, her red latex body suit was hugging her in all the WRONG places. She even placed her hand over her private area in hopes of hiding it. But, fans were quick to point it out. “When he saw her BET outfit he was majorly turned on. He thought she looked great,” our insider added.  “Drake thinks Nicki is the only rapper that always looks sexy no matter what she wears. He would still hook-up with Nicki anytime,” the source continued. Talk about determination! “Drake has always felt Nicki was wifey material and her style choices are always sexy,” the source said. We definitely agree.  In the past Nicki has denied Drake, but maybe this time things will be different! Plus, she’s single! As many of you may know, she recently got out of a relationship with Nas.",1

"If you're a big fan of Khloé Kardashian, then the last few days have not exactly been the greatest. On April 10, it was reported that Tristan Thompson cheated on her, at a time when Kardashian was set to give birth any day. And, although Kardashian remained radio silent when the world initially got hold of Thompson's rumored affairs, we're reportedly hearing about her reaction to the whole ordeal. On April 11, E! News reported Khloe Kardashian's response to Tristan Thompson cheating reports, and it is beyond sad.  On April 10, it came out that Thompson, who was in New York City with his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates for the weekend, was spotted on Saturday, April 7, at a rooftop bar and lounge. According to The Daily Mail, Thompson was seen kissing another woman who wasn't Kardashian. A woman who reportedly filmed Thompson with the mystery woman told The Daily Mail, ""I was there and he was on the table right next to us with a group of friends and some girl who he was obviously making out with all night ... They were holding each other and it was so obvious. They were there when I got there and they were part of a big group of friends."" Elite Daily reached out to Kardashian and Thompson's teams regarding the report but did not hear back by the time of publication.  Fans of the couple were not happy — and for good reason. When all of this came to a head, Kardashian was in Cleveland, getting ready to give birth to their daughter. You know Cleveland? The place that Kardashian moved to from Los Angeles to be with Thompson and prepare for her labor? She even wrote about the relocation on her app, telling her fans why she decided to make the big move. She wrote,  Throughout my pregnancy, I traveled back and forth between L.A. and Cleveland quite a bit, but after a while, it was a little difficult. It was more tiring and my body got swollen, which never used to happen before pregnancy. I obviously love both cities, but I will say I’m happy to be in Cleveland right now.  She continued,  ...I’m with Tristan and I get my home time — cooking, being with my love, and just more of a routine. In L.A., I’m SWAMPED with work. But then again, I love being in L.A. because I get to see my sisters and my mom, and I have my trainer and the people that I’ve grown up with. So there are perks to both cities for me!  But now, Kardashian has finally weighed in on the matter and responded to the report of Thompson's alleged affairs.  E! News reports from a source that Kardashian is ""distraught"" over the reports. The source continued,  Her entire world has been turned upside down. She cried hysterically all night. She begged to come back to L.A. and tried to find any way to make it work but her doctor wouldn't let her. She just wants to be with her family and leave as soon as possible. Kris is there and completely supporting her.  The source also said,  She will obviously never be able to trust Tristan again or look at him the same way ... Her world is shattered. She is in complete disbelief that this is happening. The family absolutely believes it's in Khloe's best interest to end the relationship but will support her either way.  Elite Daily reached out to Kardashian's team for comment on the report but did not hear back by the time of publication.  Honestly, this is heartbreaking. It can't be easy to have all of this negative attention surrounding you, especially while pregnant. The source also said, ""Everyone is in crisis mode and is trying to be very calm for Khloe ... They are really worried for her. They are worried about the health of the baby and thinks she will go into labor any second.""  It breaks my heart that Kardashian seemed so over-the-moon with Thompson, only to have something like this surface about the man she loves.  Beyond sad.  To add salt in the wound, TMZ claims to have obtained surveillance footage of Thompson reportedly hanging out with three women at a hookah lounge back in October of 2017, which appears to show Thompson kissing one woman, and provocatively touching another's chest — all of this allegedly happening while Kardashian was three months pregnant with Thompson's child.  Sending good thoughts over to Kardashian right now. No matter what happens moving forward, I hope she chooses to do what's best for her and her daughter. Luckily, she has a tight-knit family who will undoubtedly be there for her, regardless of her choice.",1
"This article is over 8 months old  Duke of Edinburgh discharged after spending more than a week at King Edward VII hospital  The Duke of Edinburgh has been discharged from hospital after a hip operation.  Prince Philip, 96, left the private King Edward VII hospital in London at midday on Friday; he was admitted on Tuesday 3 April.  Buckingham Palace said he would continue his recovery at Windsor, adding: “His royal highness would like to convey his appreciation for the messages of good wishes he has received.”  On Thursday, he was visited by his daughter, the princess royal, who said he was “on good form”.  Anne, whose visit lasted about 50 minutes, is believed to be theonly member of the royal family to visit Philip in the central London hospital.  The Queen also gave an update, telling a wellwisher in Windsor: “He said he’s getting on very well.”  The duke will have begun his rehabilitation, moving with the aid of a stick or crutches, and will face weeks of aftercare as he learns to walk again on his new hip.  For about a month before the operation, Philip had complained about trouble with the joint. Medical experts have said a few weeks after a hip replacement patients are usually back to their normal lifestyle, free from pain.  The Queen Mother underwent two successful hip replacement operations in the 1990s, first a planned procedure aged 95, followed by an emergency operation when she was 97.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding on 19 May is likely to be the first public appearance by the Queen’s consort since the operation.",0
"So exactly what led Renée Zellweger, an Oscar-winning actress, to make her big return to Hollywood in the role of a prophetic housewife in a hackneyed family drama? Well, one theory is that she was desperate for work, which is a lousy position for a star who was once so highly employable to be in. So, accepting whatever middle-aged lady roles she was offered may have made the difference for Zellweger between seeing screen time or not — even if they aren't the kind of movies that would make for an amazing mid-life career renaissance.  There's also a chance Zellweger's just not all that interested in Hollywood anymore, especially when you consider the fact that she disappeared almost as quickly as she reappeared after Bridget Jones' Baby came and went. If that's the case, then we say: Do your thing, Renée! Still, we have our suspicions that Zellweger will break out onto the acting scene once more when the time is right…",1

"Michelle Obama and Barack Obama might be two of the most-missed former residents of the White House. Even though Obama's presidency ended over a year-and-a-half ago, the couple known for being #relationshipgoals has recently come back into the spotlight. With Obama's 57th birthday on Saturday, Aug. 4, Michelle took to social media to wish her husband a happy birthday with a sweet post about him. Michelle Obama wished Barack Obama happy birthday with a thoughtful photo and message to Obama on Instagram.  Like any good significant other in the age of technology, Michelle made sure that she wished Obama a happy birthday on social media. The photo of Obama on Instagram and Twitter is accompanied by a short caption, but Michelle did anything but phone it in on this one. She posted what looks like a personal picture of Obama looking deep in thought as he overlooks a desert, and she wrote,  Happy birthday @BarackObama! The view is always better with you.  OK, you can now add ""expert at writing captions"" to Michelle's resume. I mean, c'mon, that post is sure to bring a smile to Obama's face when he sees it. Would you really expect anything less from this couple, though?  These two have proven time and again that they know how to keep their relationship going strong. Just look at their date night on the weekend of July 28, when the couple attended Beyoncé and JAY-Z's OTR II tour in Maryland. Not only did they make time to spend together at the show, but they spent that time doing what you should be doing at a Beyoncé concert: dancing! Seriously, the Obamas showed that they know how to move to the music, and the lucky concertgoers around them caught it all on video — but beware to get all the FOMO when you watch it.  When it comes to birthdays, though, it really isn't shocking that Michelle knocked it out of the park with this post. Her short and sweet caption about how ""the view is always better"" with Obama is such a thoughtful message to her husband. The swoon-worthy birthday posts must be a hallmark of their relationship, because Obama also shared an IG post to his better half on Jan. 17 to celebrate Michelle's big day. He wrote,  You're not only my wife and the mother of my children, you're my best friend. I love your strength, your grace, and your determination. And I love you more each day. Happy Birthday, @MichelleObama  It's not only birthdays that bring out the sweet messages from this couple, though. Obama also wrote Michelle a Valentine's Day post on Feb. 14 that said she makes ""every day and every place better."" I'm inclined to agree with the former POTUS on that one.  Really, there is no shortage of examples of how these two celebrate and lift each other up on the most special days in their lives. I would like to imagine that they are also they kind of couple that leaves little love notes for each other around the house on a daily basis.  Of course, I don't know if that's how the Obamas roll, but I do know they've perfected the art of the social media birthday post. Hopefully Obama is brainstorming Michelle's post for January!",0

"Three months after first revealing the story of her daughter India’s involvement with the group NXIVM, Dynasty star Catherine Oxenberg has decided to write a book to share her story with the hope it can also help others.  Her memoir, CAPTIVE: A Mother’s Crusade to Save Her Daughter From a Terrifying Cult, cowritten by PEOPLE contributor Natasha Stoynoff, will be released in Fall and will recount Catherine’s estrangement from her 26-year-old daughter, India, and her attempt to rescue her from what she believes is a dangerous group.  “I was completely ignorant about these sorts of the dangers and traps associated with these so-called personal growth self help groups. It’s an $11 billion, completely unregulated industry, so I reached out to a lot of experts for guidance,” Catherine tells PEOPLE. “What I learned along the way could help others [and] prevent them from falling into the same trap, know what warning signs to look for, and also to give hope to those parents that are struggling and who have lost children to similar situations.  “So many people reached out to me when I went public saying, ‘Oh my God, I’m in the same situation. I’m heartbroken, I’ve lost my child. I don’t know what to do,” she adds.  Allison Michael Orenstein  India was 20 years old when she and her mother attended a meeting as part of a leadership seminar organized by NXIVM in 2011. While the meeting was supposed to provide methods for self-improvement, Catherine told PEOPLE she found the organization “weird and creepy.” India didn’t have the same hesitations and immersed herself in the organization over the next few years.  NXIVM has been around for 20 years, with approximately 16,000 people paying thousands of dollars for experiences like executive-coaching workshops. Run by Keith Raniere, 57, who is known as “Vanguard” to members, NXIVM has offices throughout the country and in Mexico.  Catherine and daughter India Wenn/Alamy  “The mission of NXIVM is to help transform and, ultimately, be an expression of the noble civilization of humans,” the organization states on their website.  Not only do former followers dispute this claim, many have shared horror stories of allegedly having their skin branded with Rainere’s initials and describe the group as a “cult.”  Last April, Catherine claims she learned her daughter was also in potential danger.  Her friend, Bonnie Piesse, 34, had left the group and warned Catherine that India was taking part in what Catherine calls a “secret sisterhood.”  “You need to save your daughter,” Piesse told her, according to Catherine. “You need to save India.”  In December, the New York Times reported that Justice Department has opened an investigation into NXIVM.  Catherine and young daughter India Ron Galella/WireImage  But that doesn’t ease Catherine’s immediate concerns for her daughter.  Catherine previously told PEOPLE that she learned India was on a restrictive diet, suffered hair loss, and hadn’t had her period in a year. Now she says she’s told that India is eating more because “they’re trying to look more normal,” but says she’s still worried.  After Catherine decided to go public with her allegations in October, India became angry and further withdrew from her. Catherine tells PEOPLE that India was recently in Los Angeles, but wasn’t willing to see her.  “She was in L.A. and I was hoping that was a good sign, and I was very distressed when she flew back [to NXIVM’s headquarters Albany],” Catherine says. “Even is she’s not willing to see me, the fact that she’s outside of their sphere of influence physically gave me hope.”  “I’m assuming they kept her on a tight leash so that they still had a lot of influence over her,” she says. “Because if she [leaves the group], that’s a tremendous blow to [NXIVM] considering she’s been such a public figure for them. I think that that could be the death blow and I think they’re doing everything they can to keep her in.”  As India becomes more entangled in the controversial group, Catherine is writing the memoir in another attempt to save India.  CAPTIVE will reveal the steps Catherine has taken to extract her daughter from what she considers a “dangerous, mind-controlling cult” in which she claims the women are treated like “slaves.” She also draws on interviews from former members and cult experts.  “I’ve grown as a person through this experience [and] I’ve become more inclusive,” Catherine says. “It’s no longer just about my daughter. It’s about helping everybody who has suffered through this.”",0

"Blake told the crowd during a performance in Oklahoma that Gwen had given birth to twins.  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are taking aim at the constant tabloid rumors claiming that they’re having children. The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple’s child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.  Shelton made the joke about his girlfriend – who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale – while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.  A video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet “Go Ahead And Break My Heart” as they both stopped by Shelton’s restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.  After Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting “Gwen! Gwen! Gwen!” as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.  That’s when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all “lucky” to have her perform because she’d only just given birth to their twins the day before.  “You guys are very lucky that [she’s here],” Blake told the very excited crowd as he spoke about Gwen.  “She actually gave birth to twins yesterday,” the country star then joked of how they’re hounded by pregnancy rumors, “and she’s here tonight to sing with me.”  Gwen then joined her boyfriend on stage wearing a long grey shirt and thigh-high red boots as the couple, who first met when they were both coaches on NBC’s The Voice in 2014, performed their duet together.  #summer2017 ❤️love u guys gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jul 7, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT  The twosome then sweetly clapped for one another after finishing their performance, before sharing a quick kiss on the lips as the crowd looked on.  Shelton, who was clearly in a playful mood as he performed for fans in his home state, then jokingly wiped his mouth and stared at his hand after sharing a kiss on the lips with Gwen as he poked a little fun at the star for the amount of lipstick she was wearing.  Of course, the star was only joking when he told the crowd that Stefani had given birth to twins one day earlier, though it was just a few days later that the couple proudly put their romance on display once again.  Charley Gallay / Getty Images  Though it appeared that they were separated for Valentine’s Day – likely due to Shelton’s busy touring schedule – Stefani gave fans a good look at how her boyfriend surprised her on February 14.  Gwen – who’s mom to three boys, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 3-year-old Apollo – shared various videos and photos on her Snapchat account of the stunning bouquet of pink flowers her boyfriend had delivered to her home in Los Angeles.  Stefani even gave fans a look at the message Blake wrote to her in his Valentine’s Day card, sharing a photo of the inside of the card she received from her fellow musician which read, “Happy Valentine’s Day. I love you! Blake.”",0
"Our not-so-secret secret is that we expect most, if not all, of our products to work double-duty. Cheek stain doubles as lip pigment, and brown eyeshadow helps fill in our brows. But, there's one tube in our makeup bags that could do so much more: concealer.  What we normally slather onto zits and undereye circles has many other applications. We tapped makeup artist Tina Turnbow to show us five techniques that turn our old cover-up into a highlighter, brow accent, lip definer, and more.  Ahead, find her step-by-step instructions for using concealer to get a gorgeous face. Don't you just love a good multitasker?  Hello, Highlighter  If you haven't plunked down the cash for a contour kit with a shadow powder and highlighter, your concealer could sub in a pinch. ""Make sure you're using one that's about two shades lighter than your skin tone,"" Turnbow says.    Start with your contour powder. Find your cheekbones, and slide the pigment just below them in a downward motion. ""It should end a couple of inches away from the corner of your mouth,"" Turnbow says.

Use your fingers to pat it on along the tops of your cheekbones. Then, bring it up until it reaches just above the tip of your eyebrows. ""Look for a concealer with a radiant aspect to it,"" she says. ""This will help attract the light.""  Product used: NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, ($29; nars.com)    For your nose contour, use the same shadow you swept under your cheekbones. Focus it along the two edges of the bone. ""Start right under the ends of your brows, and bring it down to the tips,"" Turnbow says.    Your concealer should sit in the center of your nose. Swipe it in a downward motion, to the tip. Then, blend your three lines together. ""When you blend, make sure you're still able to see the product,"" Turnbow says. ""People tend to over-blend and erase the work they just did. Instead, just blur the edges so that they're less noticeable, but still there.""    The result is bright, beautiful, and so easy to do. It's contouring that works in real life—not the crazy sculpting you see on the red carpet all the time. [Read the full story on Refinery29!]",0

"Francia Raisa has previously detailed her difficult physical recovery after she donated a kidney to best friend Selena Gomez, but recently the grown-ish star recalled the toll it took on her mental health as well.  Speaking with Self about the moment Gomez, 25, revealed they were a confirmed match for the transplant procedure, Raisa, 29, said she turned to her social worker for advice about what to expect.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “It’s going to be hard, the recipient is going to glow and she’s going to recover a lot faster than the donor because she’s getting something she needs and you are losing something you don’t need to lose. It’s going to be hard,” the actress recalled of the pre-surgery conversation.  “And it was hard,” said Raisa, who added: “Selena and I both went through a depression.”  Also in the on-camera interview, Raisa walked fans through the steps of the transplant as she had the button on her jeans undone to show her “C-section scar” and the marks on her stomach area.  Francia Raisa SELF  “Your scars don’t define you. It’s a part of your story. It’s a part of the story that makes you special and you different,” she emphasized as she also noted that Gomez has a scar on the inside of her leg due to an emergency surgery following the transplant.  Gomez shocked fans in September 2017 when she announced that, due to complications of the autoimmune disease lupus, she had received a kidney transplant from Raisa over the summer.  “Recovery was hard,” Raisa said in an interview with W Magazine earlier this month. “I didn’t want to eat, I didn’t want to drink anything.”  RELATED: Selena Gomez’s BFF Francia Raisa Reveals Why She Decided to Give Her a Kidney  Selena Gomez and Francia Raisa Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  In February, Raisa told Harry Connick Jr. that she was “unable to move for two months” post-op.  “I couldn’t do anything active. All I could do was walk. That was very hard for me, and I have a dog. Every day the thing I look forward to is drinking my coffee and walking, and I couldn’t do that. It was really, really hard,” she said during her appearance on his daytime talk show Harry.  Gomez continues to be open about her battle with lupus after first revealing in 2015 that she’d undergone chemotherapy to treat the disease.  Lupus causes the immune system to attack its own organs and tissues and can affect the whole body. According to the Lupus Foundation of America, about half of all cases of systemic lupus affect a major organ such as the heart, lung, kidneys or brain. In some cases, it can take years for the disease to be diagnosed and properly treated.",0
"SPOILER ALERT: Do not read on unless you’ve watched the Game of Thrones Season 7 premiere.  While many Game of Thrones fans had different reactions to Ed Sheeran’s cameo in the Season 7 premiere, Game of Thrones director Jeremy Podeswa had nothing but good things to say about the singer.  The Thinking Out Loud singer made a cameo appearance as a Lannister soldier with his campfire singing catching the attention of Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) who was passing by but then cautiously joined their party for dinner.  “It was lovely working with Ed,” Podeswa told Variety. “He is one of the nicest guys in the world, and he really is one of the guys. He’s lovely, he’s a team player, he wants to do a good job, he takes direction, he’s very open.”  READ MORE: Ed Sheeran’s ‘Game of Thrones’ cameo receives mixed reviews from fans  The episode’s director continued: “He’s a big fan of the show and he was really excited to be a part of it. I think his lovely voice was used to great effect and he just has a really nice presence.”  Podeswa also said that Sheeran “blends into the world of the show in a nice way” and that if people didn’t know who the singer was, “nobody would even blink about his presence on the show.”  Sheeran’s appearance as a Lannister soldier drew a mix of criticism and praise from fans of the show, including some calling the show “less authentic” due to his cameo.  Podeswa told Newsweek that he was “quite surprised” about the reaction to Sheeran’s appearance.  “I know he’s very well known and a successful singer but you’re in the bubble of the show — the cast are well known too, everybody is really well known… none of them can walk down the street without being followed,” Podeswa said. “I think people interrogated it too much, they’re bringing so much of his [superstar] presence into the thing which is far beyond what anybody was thinking going into it. He is known to the producers of the show and some of the cast, and he’s a gigantic fan of the show.”  READ MORE: ‘Game Of Thrones’ actor Kit Harington speaks out about ‘a**holes’ who leak spoilers  The Castle on the Hill singer isn’t the first musician to make a cameo appearance on the HBO show.

Fun! pic.twitter.com/aV9ii7X1 — gary lightbody (@garysnowpatrol) July 23, 2012  READ MORE: New ‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7 trailer: Winter is coming  After Sheeran’s appearance on the show as a singing soldier became a buzzed-about topic on social media, his Twitter account suddenly vanished.  The Twitter disappearance was short-lived because he is now back online but all of his tweets since April 2015 have been removed and the singer’s more than 19 million followers have been reduced to a few thousand.  The 26-year-old told Britain’s Sun tabloid this month that he was no longer using his Twitter account aside from posting his Instagram pictures to it. He called Twitter a platform for “saying mean things” and was trying to “work out why people dislike me so much.”  Sheeran took to Instagram on Wednesday to deny that his Twitter absence had anything to do with the backlash from his Game of Thrones appearance.  “I came off Twitter coz I was always intending to come off Twitter, had nothing to do with what people said about my Game of Thrones cameo,” the singer wrote. “Why the hell would I worry what people thought about that. It’s clearly f***in’ awesome.”  The HBO drama’s seventh-season premiere last weekend drew a record-setting 10.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen company figures released Tuesday.  —With files from the Associated Press",0
"April the giraffe with her new baby calf shortly after she gave birth last year. (Photo: USA TODAY)  After months of questions and rumors, Animal Adventure Park owner Jordan Patch announced Wednesday the news millions of worldwide giraffe fans have been waiting to hear: April the giraffe is pregnant again.  Last month, the park announced it was sending 30 days worth of fecal samples to another zoo's laboratory for progesterone testing to confirm the pregnancy, 14 months after April gave birth to her calf, Tajiri on site at the park.  Keeper Allysa Swilley had collected a fecal sample from April's stall over the course of a month. The samples were secured in plastic bags, labeled and dated before being put in freezer storage.

"The newly wedded Duchess of Sussex Meghan has joined Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth II at a series of events as she launched into life as a full-time royal.  ROYAL aides are said to be concerned over the public outbursts of Meghan Markle’s dad, following a number of explosive TV interviews in recent months.  According to the Mirror in the UK, aides at the Palace have held at least three top-level crisis meetings on how to stop Thomas Markle upsetting his daughter.  It comes after the 74-year-old claimed the Duchess is “terrified” of her new royal role and, royal insiders say, “crossed the line” with his comments that Princess Diana would have “loathed” how he had been frozen out of the royal circle, reports The Sun.  The Mirror also claims that the matter has gotten so out of hand that royal sources say the only way to end the farce will be for the Queen to step in.  Sources suggest the talks have centred around three potential options to bring the situation to a close.  The first would be for Meghan to talk directly to her father via a phone call in a personal appeal for him to stop, and a second could be to arrange an intermediary meeting to appeal to him face-to-face.  A final scenario would be to cut him off, the Mirror has claimed.  Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims.  The Daily Mail reported an unnamed friend of Meghan’s saying that a reconciliation is completely off the table.  “There’s no chance right now - he’s been a complete embarrassment,” the source said.  MORE: Thomas Markle speaks about former drug use.  MORE: Meghan’s kids will have surprising surname  The Palace crisis talks come just days after the Duchess’ dad confessed to taking drugs while his daughter Meghan was growing up.  Meghan’s outspoken father made the startling admission as he angrily denied having a drinking problem.  He said: “I don’t do drugs, haven’t for more than 20 years” while claiming he only has wine with dinner.  Mr Markle insisted that he doesn’t even drink beer despite being photographed with a six pack.  He said: “I regularly buy a six-pack for the guys on the guard gate because they’re stuck in a hot shack for hours each day and could use a cold one.”  A source close to the family added that Mr Markle used drugs to cope with the pressures of Hollywood while working as a lighting director.  They said that drug use was “part and parcel” of working in television where the hours were long.  While Mr Markle did not specify which drugs he used to take, his daughter Samantha said that marijuana was popular among his peers at the time.

"Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt 2018: No Rom-Com Reunion, No Engagement for Justin Theroux's and Angelina Jolie's Former Spouses  Wednesday, August 1, 2018 1:22 AM UTC  Hollywood is practically built on rumors and hearsays, so it’s no surprise that there have been reports of all kinds about the Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt situation. Numerous publications have been circulating details about how the pair will supposedly reunite on-screen with a romantic comedy project, for example. There have also been reports of the two getting married. As it turns out, neither of these is true.  Listing a variety of rumors and reports that it considers false, Gossip Cop has certainly gone out of its way to try and prove other publications wrong. The stated fictional declarations on that list include the supposed secret Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt marriage and that the pair is engaged once again.  Apparently, publications have been taking the smallest details to spin a narrative that was nowhere close to the truth. For example, a snapshot of the “Friends” actress wearing a ring for the movie she was shooting called “Murder Mystery” was mistaken for an engagement ring. This was quickly picked up and circulated all over the web, leading to a Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumor feeding frenzy.  There were also some reports about the former married couple tying the knot once more to celebrate what would have been their 18th wedding anniversary. As Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumors go, this one might just be one of the most misleading.  The part about the two actors being in a romantic-comedy has also been debunked recently by Gossip Cop, as well, which was reposted by MSN. Neither of the Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt parties had shown any indication that such a rumor was even close to being true. In fact, past discussions alluding to the same topic have been denied by spokespersons of the actors before.  For Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt news that does come with evidence, it would seem that the “Fight Club” actor likes to model his look after whoever he is currently dating. This tidbit was posted by Twitter user Sarah McGonagall after she spotted it on an old Daily Express article. At least this proposition actually has photographic proof.",1
"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  For those reeling from a rocky relationship, here’s some advice you can take at face value: get a nose job.  That’s exactly what 28-year-old reality TV personality, Naomie Olindo, decided to do less than half a year after breaking up with heartthrob, Craig Conover. On Thursday, the star of Southern Charm revealed the results of her makeover on Instagram, complete with a nose emoji to further press the point.  Admitting that a bit of swelling was still present in the wake of the procedure less than two weeks earlier, Olindo claimed during an interview on Bravo TV that she decided to take advantage of the show’s post-season hiatus to undergo the procedure. It stated it was something she had wanted to do since she was eight years old. She also said she suffered no pain at all while on the operating table.  Even before she shared the news, fans on social media pointed out that she didn’t quite look the same. However, after commenting on the change, Olindo got a few negative responses and quickly defended her decision. She noted she was happy about the effect of the results on her self-esteem and would do it again.  inquisitr.com  Her rhinoplasty venture might help her move on after splitting from Conover, a relationship that dominated story arcs during seasons three and four of Southern Charm. Olindo originally met Conover in South Carolina at the College of Charleston, but they actually started dating after they graduated.  The most recent season saw the two try to navigate stormy waters as audiences watched their relationship start to unravel, especially when Olindo and Conover underwent therapy to keep their connection from further fraying. Unfortunately, the twosome called it quits in September.  Even after the breakup, Olindo claims she's still the best of friends with Conover, adding that he provided a lot of support for her in a text regarding her nose job.  The two will also remain in the cast of the forthcoming fifth season of Southern Charm, which recently promoted recurring personality Chelsea Meissner to become part of the core ensemble. That decision seems to be a no-brainer, considering Meissner was at the center of a three-way relationship that sparked plenty of interest among viewers.

"The Biebs comes from a very poor, trashy family in Ontario--a teenage mother, a deadbeat father who only re-emerged when his kid became famous (and then they started getting tattoos, getting wasted, and getting laid together like father and sons do), and no hope in hell of a future. He was a cherubic kid with a lot of musical talent, and then the story goes that Usher ""discovered"" him on YouTube and the rest is history. We all know that when you make it as massive as Biebs did, with no solid family to ground him, a lot of dark shit unfolds. And the money beckons. Biebs is a bona-fide prolapsed asshole to be sure, but he is an uneducated high school dropout who came from a family that went for the money, and he became world-famous when he was a naive kid. He was the sacrifice. With a very cute face and hairless young body and a stage mother who pushed her little boy into show biz.  During that journey to wealth and riches, you don't think he was a pass-around Patty to powerful men, like the execrable pervert Kevin Spacey, whose face has always been characterized by smugness and perversion?  ..isn't Patty his fucking MOM'S name?!

"The West Texas Federal Appeals Court, operating out of the 33rd District, has ordered that Barack Obama repay $400 Million to the American people for funds he says were “lost” during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. Judge Gary Jones and Judge Amanda Perry stood together to overrule Judge Kris Weinshenker in a split decision.Weinshenker, a liberal snowflake appointed by Clinton, was put in his place when the two Bush appointees smacked down a ruling on Obama worthy of the title “Muslim Terrorist Usurper who Held Our Country Hostage.” Jones and Perry pulled no punches in their decisions.Jones wrote:“Never have we had a man do so much damage to our country in two short terms. To grow an economy after saving it from the brink of destruction might be something to be proud of on the outside, but two percent growth might as well be a negative.”Judge Perry added:“Never before has a President taken a knee during his term and flaked on his duties like Obama did. This money is owed to the American perople and then some. Punitive damages weren’t assessed. Had they been it is doubtful Mr. Obama would ever recover financially.”Source: http://dailyworldupdate.com",1

"It’s been more than three years since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their decision to separate after 10 years of marriage.  Though the two have not been romantically involved since then, they have remained very much a part of each other’s lives, co-parenting their three children — Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Sam, 6 — together and often attending church and going on vacations as a family.  Then on Wednesday, Garner was spotted driving her ex to a rehab facility.  “Ben’s priorities remain his family and his sobriety,” a source told ET. “He continues to attend meetings and mediation classes for his well-being. You have to work at your sobriety every day and he does that.”  Since their separation in 2015, the exes have not officially divorced. While Garner, 46, has remained fiercely private and protective of her family, she has, on occasion, spoken about Affleck and their children.  Here’s everything she’s said about Affleck since their split:  July 2018  Garner opened up about the pressures of public life on her marriage and her family during a CBS Sunday Morning interview, saying, “Looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I really — I could cry talking about it.”  She added, “What I think I’ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, ‘cause you think that’ll end the, ‘Are they engaged? Are they not?’ And that’s true in reverse, as well. If you are — if there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloids decide there’s trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny, everyone says, ‘Oh, you’ve had to go through this in public.’ The public isn’t what’s hard. What’s hard is going through it.”  June 2018  For Father’s Day, Garner penned a rare and touching tribute to Affleck on Instagram, writing, “Our kids are lucky to have a dad who looks at them the way you look at them and loves them the way you love them, @benaffleck. #happyfathersday #threeluckykids #haveagreatday.”  November 2017  In an interview with news.com.au, Garner talked about being separated from the father of her children, saying, “I would not have chosen this life for myself or for my kids. I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It’s something that we are working through.”  May 2017  After People magazine released a cover story about Garner’s new life as a single mom, Garner took to Facebook to set the record straight.  “This isn’t a tragedy by any measure, but it does affect me and my family and so, before my mom’s garden club lights up her phone, I wanted to set the record straight,"" she said. ""I did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article. While we are here, for what it’s worth: I have three wonderful kids and my family is complete.”  October 2016  Garner spoke with ET’s Denny Directo at the Save the Children Illumination Gala about how she and Affleck have chosen to raise their kids.  “It’s so important that you model for your kids how to be a citizen of the world, and I think that’s the best thing you can do,” she told ET, adding that she and Affleck each have special causes that they try to teach their kids about.  “That’s really important at home, to make sure that our kids know that we both have causes that we care so much about… that we dedicate time, resources, and our energy toward making our own little slice of the world a little bit better,” she said.  August 2016  'We are definitely a modern family': #JenniferGarner talks to @nmoralesnbc about family and marriage https://t.co/jJpZAE5BoG — TODAY (@TODAYshow) August 4, 2016  Garner was praised on the Today show for putting her kids first while dealing with the end of her marriage.  “It has to be,” she said. ""You don’t have a choice. It has to be.”  Calling their family unit “definitely a modern family,” she added, “We’re doing really well.”  She also opened up about her decision to take her kids to London for the filming of Justice League, in which Affleck played Batman.  “Ben was working on Justice League, and I thought, ‘Well, the kids should have that experience,'” she explained. “He and I are great friends, and we just all went en masse.”",1

"Allison Janney has celebrated her Oscar win by sporting a top bearing the slogan: “I survived awards season and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!”  The 58-year-old Hollywood star ended her successful run at the recent spate of awards ceremonies by taking the best supporting actress award for her performance in I, Tonya at the Academy Awards on Sunday.  Hours later, Janney went back to work on her sitcom Mom, where she showed off a new garment given to her by a colleague that poked fun at her many wins over the past few months.

"After being in limbo for three years after announcing their split in June 2015, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck‘s marriage has officially come to an end.  PEOPLE confirmed the two finalized their divorce on Thursday after they met at Garner’s house with lawyers and a private judge.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The finalization came one day after news broke the actress, 46, had requested a private judge to handle the final details of their divorce, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.  The estranged couple announced their separation after 10 years of marriage and three children together: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6. Affleck, 46, and Garner began dating in 2004 and married in June 2005 before simultaneously filing for divorce in April 2017.  In the time between their split announcement and the divorce filing, the former couple presented a largely united front as they went through challenges together — namely, Affleck’s recent rehab stay. Garner showed her support by driving him to the treatment facility.  Here’s an inside look into the former couple’s ups and downs.  “The Love of My Life”  Six months after the former couple announced their split, Affleck was living in the guesthouse of their family home — something that seemed to begin taking a toll.  “It’s obvious many times that they both find it annoying to deal with each other,” an insider told PEOPLE at the time. “Understandably so. It’s a strange situation to live together and yet be separated.”  Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck at the 2013 Academy Awards Jason Merritt/Getty  “They are doing what is working for the kids,” a Garner source noted of the living set-up.  For Affleck, keeping his mind on work apparently helped ease the pain of the separation. In September 2015, he was focusing on his directorial effort Live By Night and promoting Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. “He is happier and a more fulfilled person when he’s busy all day and night working,” a film source told PEOPLE. A source close to the actor added, “He is as happy as he can be in this position. I don’t think it’s that easy, and definitely not that easy to do it in the public eye.”  In February 2016, Garner opened up about the ongoing divorce in an interview with Vanity Fair. While the actress called Affleck “the love of my life,” she also opened up about their marital struggles, telling the magazine, “I always say, ‘When his sun shines on you, you feel it. But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it’s cold.’ He can cast quite a shadow.”  Affleck later told The New York Times, “She’s allowed to talk about it,” adding, “She felt like she wanted to discuss it and get it out there and get it over with so she could say, ‘Look, I already talked about it – I don’t want to do it again.’ ”  After celebrating Easter as a family in Los Angeles that year, Affleck and Garner spent a month in Europe with their kids while he filmed Justice League, including time in London and a family getaway to Paris. “She did have the best time in Europe with Ben and the kids,” a friend of Garner’s told PEOPLE. “She seemed to enjoy spending time with Ben again.”  Co-Parenting After Their Split  Garner and Affleck stayed close as they continued to live and vacation together as well as co-parent their kids — while also stepping out for solo outings. Shortly after announcing the separation, the entire family jetted off to the Bahamas to spend time together.  Jennifer Garner with her three children, Seraphina, Violet and Samuel at her Walk of Fame Ceremony in August Vince Flores/Startraksphoto.com  The family reunited again the following month in Atlanta, Georgia, where Garner was filming Miracles from Heaven. Affleck traveled to the Southern state to celebrate his 43rd birthday with his ex and the kids. “He’s happiest when he’s with his family,” a close friend told PEOPLE at the time.  In September 2015, the pair were spotted leaving a family counseling center in L.A. This marked their first visit to the center since announcing their divorce. Before their decision to separate, they attended weekly counseling sessions at the center but stopped going in the months leading to their split.  A source said they chose to remain friendly for reasons beyond parenting. “It’s not just for the kids – it’s also for them,” said the source. “They care about each other.” As the family continued to step out as a unit, observers noticed that Affleck and Garner seem to be looking happier after a tumultuous summer. “His family is all [Ben] cares about. This is what makes him happy and it makes sense that he looks happier,” another source told PEOPLE. “He enjoys the time with his family and that includes Jen.”  Since then, the two have worked hard at maintaining a harmonious relationship for the sake of their children. They recently took the kids to see Hello, Dolly! on Broadway in mid-July, starring family friend Victor Garber, and spent Easter together in Hawaii where Affleck was filming.  On Sunday, the two stepped out at church together with their children after Affleck completed 30 days in rehab. Three days later, Affleck and Garner stepped out with the kids again for a school event on Wednesday.  “He went to church on Sunday with his family,” a source told PEOPLE. The source added Affleck was smiling during the outing because the 30-day milestone means “he has reason to celebrate.”  From Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous  Moving On  Affleck began dating Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus in 2017. The two made their relationship public when they were spotted grabbing dinner in July 2017.  The couple dated for more than a year, often taking trips together to Hawaii and Puerto Rico, where the actor was working. Affleck was even in attendance at the 2017 Emmy Awards in which Shookus, 38, took to the stage when SNL won for outstanding variety sketch series.  The two spent time together at Affleck’s home in Los Angeles and were often spotted grabbing dinner around the city.  In August 2018, a source told PEOPLE the two split because of the long distance between Affleck living in Los Angeles and Shookus being in New York. The two stopped being photographed together in July.  Upon his return to rehab, a source close to Shookus and Affleck told PEOPLE the producer “had been supporting Ben’s sobriety and going to meetings with him.”  “She had him in meditation and they were doing it together,” the source said. “His recovery was something that was very important to both of them.”  Ben Affleck and Shauna Sexton Lastarpix/BACKGRID  “It was very hard for her to break up with Ben, but she knew he wasn’t getting better and that it was time for her to step aside,” the source continued. “She was trying to stay as close to him as possible so that he would stay on the right path, but ultimately it just wasn’t possible. She knew she had to let him hit bottom.”  Not long after their split, the actor was spotted with 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton having dinner at Nobu in Malibu. Shortly after that, the two were seen visiting a Jack in the Box drive-thru together over the weekend.  In September, a source close to Affleck said he and Sexton were “just getting to know each other.“  The model has been photographed leaving the actor’s home, driving his SUV and visiting him in rehab. They were photographed together this week leaving his home as he continued rehab treatment.  Entering Rehab  Multiple sources told PEOPLE in August the two were close to finalizing their divorce in the weeks leading up to Affleck’s return to rehab.  A source told PEOPLE the two were still “working on” their divorce: “They’ve spent quite some time figuring out what works best for them and their family.”  Another source said in the days before Affleck’s trip to rehab, Garner was mostly concerned about their three children.  RELATED VIDEO: Ben Affleck Reveals He Completed 40-Day Rehab Stay: ‘I Am Fighting for Myself and My Family’  “Her number one concern is the kids,” the source said, noting that Garner struggles with questions like, “Is Ben healthy enough to have custody?” Added the source: “What she ultimately cares about is his sobriety and whether she can rely on him to co-parent.”  Affleck released a statement on Thursday addressing his rehab which he posted on Instagram.  “The support I have received from my family, colleagues and fans means more to me than I can say. It’s given me the strength and support to speak about my illness with others,” Affleck wrote. “Battling any addiction is a lifelong and difficult struggle. Because of that, one is never really in or out of treatment. It is a full-time commitment. I am fighting for myself and my family.”  If you or someone you know is in need of help, please contact the SAMHSA substance abuse helpline at 1-800-662-HELP.",1

"Postby Guest » Thu Dec 21, 2017 12:26 am  He is looking for an intelligent, loyal companion. But he is always obsessed with design and wants to get a pet that is beautiful, stylish and moves great.  A rep for Pitt also laughed off the tail, er, tale.  Brad Pitt is getting a dog for companionship, according to a tabloid that is seemingly unaware he already has a dog. To exactly no one’s surprise, Gossip Cop can confirm this latest story about the actor was made-up.The piece in question can be found in the new edition of the National Enquirer, under the headline, “Brad Panting Over Dog!” The article begins by asserting the “lonely” Pitt is “on the hunt for a furry new friend!” A purported “top breeder” is quoted as saying, “Brad has been searching for a dog.“He seems to have narrowed his search down to a poodle or a Portuguese water dog,” continues the gossip magazine’s supposed tipster. While that may sound plausible, particularly since Pitt’s interest in design is well-known, the sourcing here is fishy. This alleged information comes from a purported “top breeder,” but the actor likely wouldn’t be working with a specific breeder yet if he doesn’t know which kind of dog he wants. Though standard poodles and Portuguese water dogs are considered somewhat similar canines, responsible breeders typically specialize in a single breed.What’s most strange is that nowhere does the outlet acknowledge that Pitt already has a pooch, and one that’s very different from poodles and Portuguese water dogs. The actor’s longtime pet is a bulldog, and the dog was actually mentioned multiple times in Pitt’s GQ cover story from earlier this year. In fact, Newsweek went as far as declaring Jacques was the “best thing” about the interview. Yet here’s the National Enquirer acting like he doesn’t even have a dog and suddenly needs to get one to stem his loneliness. Of course, it’s not out of the realm of possibility for Pitt to add another canine to his home, but that’s not even what the tabloid is claiming.Frankly, the supermarket tabloid has a lot of nerve claiming it knows anything about the star at all, after last year falsely accusing Pitt of beating Angelina Jolie and their kids. The magazine even doctored a photo to give Jolie a fake bruised appearance. It takes a lot of gall to write about Pitt, even on subjects as seemingly innocuous as getting a dog, after telling outright lies like that. And, for the record, Gossip Cop is told that no breeder legitimately connected to the actor leaked any real details about him getting a dog to this magazine.",1
"OMG! Katy Perry and Robert Pattinson were reportedly spotted making out at a restaurant in Los Angeles! Are they a couple?! Get the deets!  Are Katy Perry, 33, and Robert Pattinson, 31, dating? They were reportedly spotted kissing during a group dinner on Jan. 26 at Taix French Restaurant in Los Angeles, a witness told Wonderwall.com. “They were making out,” an onlooker told the website. The witness also added that their behavior made it seem like they were “totally a couple.” Eek! See pictures of Katy and Rob together here.  The Twilight actor ended his engagement to FKA Twigs, 30, in Oct. 2017, and, as we’ve previously reported, he started getting close with the “Swish Swish” singer in the aftermath of the split. “Rob’s been talking and texting with Katy, and they’ve become super super close,” a source close to Rob previously told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “There’s always been a really strong chemistry between them, and a definite attraction, but they’ve never acted on it, because all the time they’ve known each other one or other of them has been involved with someone else.”  The pair have both been single since his breakup with his former fiancée, but Rob didn’t immediately try to start a new relationship last fall out of respect. “There’s no doubt that he’s really into Katy, and that he fancies her like crazy, but, he’s determined to not get in to some kind of rebound romance — he respects and cares about Katy way too much to risk blowing the friendship they currently have,” our insider added. The American Idol judge was last romantically involved with Orlando Bloom, 41, but they ended their relationship in Feb. 2017. While nothing is confirmed yet on whether or not Rob and Katy are ~official~ we’ll be holding our breath until we find out more about this blossoming romance!  HollywoodLifers, are you excited about Katy and Rob possibly being a couple?",1
"Brad Pitt, Neri Oxman Designing “Love Nest” Together?  10:26  Brad Pitt and Neri Oxman are not teaming up on a “romantic” architecture project, despite a bogus tabloid report. The article claims the actor and MIT professor are designing a “love nest” together, but a rep for Pitt tells Gossip Cop that’s completely false.  According to the National Enquirer, the actor is planning to build a “one-of-a-kind architectural masterpiece” with Oxman, who teaches art, architecture and design at the prestigious MIT Media Lab. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “Brad’s not only inspired, he’s entranced with the brilliant brunette beauty.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Pitt and Oxman have “been secretly scouting location sites, looking for a perfect spot to make their artistic vision a groundbreaking reality.” The seemingly nonexistent tipster adds, “He’s nuts about Neri. He wants to build a palace with her… Their ‘special project’ is Brad’s dream come true.”  As Gossip Cop has repeatedly noted, the movie star and professor aren’t dating. Pitt’s own spokesperson has told us this on the record several times, and trusted entertainment publications have backed it up. E! News recently reported that Pitt and Oxman are “strictly friends,” while People similarly stated that Pitt and Oxman’s friendship “is not romantic in nature.”  Even if the two were to team up on an architecture project, it certainly wouldn’t be a “love nest.” Of course, this outlet’s narrative is coming from an anonymous and almost assuredly made-up “source.” Meanwhile, Pitt’s rep tells Gossip Cop on the record that there’s “no truth” to the tabloid’s tale and that he’s not designing any type of structure with her at all.  It’s true that the pair met last year through a project at MIT, but they have no plans to construct a building together. Nor have they been “secretly scouting” locations. It’s telling that the unreliable magazine provides zero details about the areas where they’re supposedly exploring.  Unfortunately, the National Enquirer has been pushing a nonexistent romance between Pitt and Oxman ever since the news broke last month that he had visited her MIT class in November 2017. For example, Gossip Cop recently busted the publication for falsely claiming Angelina Jolie was “furious” about Pitt and Oxman’s relationship, and that she might even use it against him in their custody negotiations. And one month before the tabloid discovered the MIT professor existed, the outlet had wrongly reported Pitt had reunited with Jennifer Aniston. The untrustworthy magazine, which seems to change its narrative whenever it’s convenient, clearly has no real insight into the actor’s personal life.

"Lisa Bonet and Jason Momoa. Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet secretly got married this October.  Although they normally keep things pretty low-key, Momoa opened up about their love to James Cordon.  He said he's had a crush on her since he was 8 years old, and that he freaked out when they first met.  Actors Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet have been one of Hollywood's cutest and most interesting couples for more than a decade now. And although they usually keep things pretty private, following the news of their recent secret wedding, Momoa has been sharing some sweet tidbits about their relationship.  Momoa, 38, appeared on ""The Late Late Show with James Corden"" and when Corden congratulated him on his recent nuptials, he happily flashed his new wedding ring. Though he and Bonet, 49, have been together for about 12 years, Momoa told Corden that their love story actually began 30 years ago, when he saw her on TV.  ""Listen it was more than [love at first sight]. Ever since I was 8 years old and I saw her on the TV I was like, 'Mommy, I want that one,'"" Momoa gushed. ""I was like, 'I'm going to stalk you for the rest of my life, and I'm going to get you.' I'm a full-fledged stalker.""  ""But yeah, I've just always wanted to meet her. She was a queen, always,"" he continued.  Despite Momoa's apparent convictions to making Bonet his wife one day, the story of how they actually met is a lot cuter. Momoa said that they met through mutual friends at a jazz club and he, understandably, freaked out about meeting his childhood crush.  ""I literally turned around and I see her and she goes, ya know, 'I'm Lisa,'"" he recalled. ""I turned around to my friend and I was like 'ahhh!' I had f------ fireworks going off inside man.""  These two love a good brew. Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Afterwards, Momoa said he ""convinced her"" to take him home to his hotel and they ended up going out to Cafe 101 in New York City for a meal.  ""We sat down, she ordered a Guinness, and that was it,"" he said.  ""'Cause you love Guinnness, right? You ordered a Guinness tonight,"" Corden said.  ""I beyond love Guinness,"" Momoa said, gesturing to his mug. ""She ordered a Guinness and I ordered grits. We had Guinness and grits, and the rest is history.""  The two have two children together, Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha Momoa and Lola Iolani Momoa, and he serves as step-dad to Bonet's daughter, actress Zoë Kravitz.  Based on their long partnership and how lovingly Momoa talks about Bonet, I think it's safe to say that they will be sharing many more pints of Guinness and many more bowls of grits together as a married couple.

"SHARE this story with your friends!Share Tweet ShareWell, well, well…it looks like Obummer wasn’t actually trying to punish Russia for anything after all (since there’s nothing to punish them FOR) — he was actually just trying to get a couple of free mansions for his brats while kissing up to his ignorant base of drooling libtards.After a breaking story about the scandal hit Russian news, multiple sources have confirmed the story. The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.But that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer’s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.Once again, we’re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won’t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties. Too bad for you two entitled brats, but maybe you should consider getting a REAL JOB because your days of stealing from hardworking taxpaying Americans are OVER.This is a developing story. Please check back for updates on this breaking scoop.",1
"Married life is so wonderful that Hugh Grant thinks he should have jumped the broom much earlier in life.  “It’s really nice, I can’t pretend it isn’t,” the British actor, 57, shared Wednesday on “Today.”  “I should have done it before,” he said. “I’m just lucky. I’m lucky. I’ve got a great wife. I love her.”  Grant tied the knot with Anna Eberstein, 39, in May, bringing his wild bachelor days to an end.  They exchanged vows in a very small ceremony in Chelsea area of London, reports The Sun.  Grant and Eberstein, who’ve been together for six years, have three kids together, five-year-old John, a daughter whose name hasn’t been made public and a baby born this spring, whose name is also not known.  He has two other kids, Felix and Tabitha, from a previous relationship with Tinglan Hong.  He says traveling with his troop of five is “unspeakable.”  “And then you go through that moral torment – do I actually travel with them or do I make an excuse that they have to go with their mom or a nanny,” he quipped.  This story originally appeared in the New York Post.",0
"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes’ romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes’ life is that she’s been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter’s philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  “My little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,” Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram.",1
"Angelina Jolie has not been enjoying very pleasant headlines lately — not since her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt took a dark turn earlier this month.  In the headlines, Jolie has stopped being the serene mother of six, glamorous movie star or compassionate United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees special envoy.  More and more, the 43-year-old Jolie has been accused of being the “crazy and manipulative” estranged wife who has become increasingly “unpopular in Hollywood.” She’s “out for blood” in the divorce fight, or she “wants to embarrass and punish” the seemingly affable Pitt by portraying him in court papers as a deadbeat dad, or by apparently trying to undercut his relationship with their children, as suggested by a family law judge.  Also damning: Page Six reported last week that Jolie had developed “an insane jealousy” jealous of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes “Amal has stolen her identity” as the world’s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.  But breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency’s efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.  The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.  But as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.  In any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children — girls especially — whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Jolie said she had met these girls herself during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings, Jolie said. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can’t read or write and has been “robbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.”  The other girl was able to go to a local high school while living in a barren Iraqi refugee camp, and is now studying dentistry at a local Iraqi university — while still living with her parents in the camp, Jolie said.  “There are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire and commitment to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries,” Jolie wrote. “There are millions of displaced parents who will make every sacrifice imaginable to help their children go to school.”  Jolie then argues how wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war: “Not with peace agreements and resolutions, as necessary as those are, but with millions of school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.”  Jolie said she understands how overwhelming these refugee crises can seem to the outside world.  “Hardly a day goes past without bleak news headlines about violence, suffering and the displacement of people, from Afghanistan to Yemen,” Jolie wrote. “It is difficult to find a single example of where we are succeeding as an international community in ending conflicts and securing peace.”  But Jolie said there is an answer in helping refugees in a “patient, long-term manner, guided by our values.” She concluded her piece by writing: “If we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and security is so important to our own. It is the wise as well as morally right course of action.”",1
"Prince Harry's net worth is 8-figures. Chris Jackson - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Megan Markle will be marrying into class, status, and major wealth when she ties the royal knot with Prince Harry on May 19.  Before she moved across the pond, Markle was earning close to half a million dollars a year starring in the USA Network drama ""Suits,"" plus a five-figure income from endorsement deals and sponsorships. Her total net worth is estimated to be $5 million.  That's a sizable contribution to bring into any marriage, but when she marries Prince Harry, their combined net worth will be more than five times that. Prince Harry's net worth is at least $25 million (£18 million) and as much as $40 million (£28.7 million), according to estimates from Wealth-X.  Here's where all that money comes from.  Along with Prince William and Kate Middleton, Harry receives an annual seven-figure allowance from his father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, which is used to cover expenses like travel and wardrobe. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Harry split nearly $5 million (£3.5 million) in allowance from their father, according to an annual review released by Clarence House.  Prince Charles derives that money, in part, from a private estate called the Duchy of Cornwall, which has funded the royal family's public and private lives for nearly 700 years. The estate provided a total of $28.8 million (£20.7 million), including Harry and William's allowance, to Prince Charles and his wife Camilla between 2016 and 2017.  Chris Jackson/Getty  Since age 21, Harry and William have also been receiving a $450,000 a year investment profit from Princess Diana's estate, which they pay taxes on to the UK government. They received a sizeable inheritance from their late mother estimated to be around $10 million each, which each prince gained access to on his 30th birthday. Plus, during his 10 years in the British Royal Air Force, Harry earned an annual income of $50,000.  Despite a massive fortune, Markle and Harry reportedly will not sign a prenuptial agreement before their wedding, reported Business Insider's Shana Lebowtiz.  A prenup is a smart choice for most couples who have sizable assets they want to protect in the event of a divorce, but for Harry — and William, who chose to forgo a prenup with Middleton — it doesn't make much sense. The princes likely don't have much property of their own, as the most valuable national treasures like the Crown Jewels or the Tower of London are part of the royal collection held by the Queen.  Still, the merging of Harry and Markle's finances could ""cause tax headaches"" and create some ""mundane hurdles"" for the royal family, as The Washington Post first reported in November.  Markle is a citizen of the US and is purportedly living in the UK on a family visa, according to the BBC. If she eventually becomes a dual US-UK citizen, Markle will have to continue filing her taxes each year with the IRS. If she has more than $300,000 in assets at any point during the year, she will have to file a specific form that details foreign assets, which could include foreign trusts, subjecting the royal family ""to outside scrutiny,"" according to the Post. But ultimately there are a lot of factors that come into play.  Eddie Mulholland/AP  ""The key for Meghan and her advisors would be to figure out what type of income she will be getting,"" Avani Ramnani, director of financial planning and wealth management at Francis Financial, told Business Insider. ""Will this income be from the investments of a trust, or 'wages' for any work that she does, or any other type of income? Sometimes, getting one form of income is more advantageous than another.""  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding — aside from Markle's dress — which is expected to cost the royal family upwards of $45 million (£32 million), most of which is allotted for security.  That won't be a huge cost burden for Queen Elizabeth, who is of course the wealthiest member of the royal family with an estimated net worth of $530 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.

"Steven Spielberg is credited with a pretty impressive list of films, which were made during his nearly 50-year career in Hollywood.  From “Jaws” to “Schindler’s List” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” the director has worked on some of the industry’s biggest movies.  But Spielberg won’t watch most of them.  “I don’t dwell,” he told E! on the red carpet for the premiere of “Speilberg,” the HBO documentary about his life and filmmaking career.  There is one exception, however.  “I’ll show my grandkids ‘E.T.’ for the first time,” he said. “And I’ll love sitting next to them and telling them that he doesn’t really die and ‘It’s only scary for a little while and then you grow to love him. I guide them through the experience.”  The 1982 film about an extraterrestrial trying to make it home is beloved by fans all over the world.  “Spielberg” will premiere on October 7 on HBO.",0
"In her first interview in four years, former child star Amanda Bynes finally explained her infamous Drake tweet from 2013 by saying, “I was serious, but I was also on drugs.”  Back in 2013, a few years after the “She’s the Man” star publicly announced her retirement from acting, Bynes sent the infamous tweet, which read “I want @drake to murder my vagina.”  “That was my way of saying, ‘Let’s do it, man,'” Bynes explained in her interview with Hollyscoop founder Diana Madison, published on Friday. “I was on drugs and trying to be hilarious,” she continued. “He’s hot! What does that even mean? It just means, like, ‘F–k me, Drake!'”  Also Read: Amanda Bynes Breaks 4-Year Silence, Announces Return to Acting (Video)  Elsewhere in the 7-minute interview Bynes expressed her desire to return to acting after her short break from the limelight. “I do miss acting, and I have something surprising to tell you: I’m going to start acting again,” she said. “I want to do TV. Maybe a few guest spots on some shows that I’m a fan of and maybe another TV show where I’m the star of it, in the future. That’s what I hope.”  The former Nickelodeon star also said that she’s been sober for three years. In 2014, Bynes was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence. She had previously been booked for hitting a police car in 2012, and entered rehab the following year.  “I’ve been going to school lately, fashion school-FIDM. And I love it,” she said. “I’ve learned how to sew, I’ve made patterns, and I want to start a clothing line in the future, so FIDM has been helping me with that.

"A picky eating phase is a rite of passage for many children and can make mealtime frustrating.  Every parent comes up with their own way to deal with this, but Chrissy Teigen's hack is creative genius. She shared the homemade restaurant menu she made for 2.5-year-old, Luna and we have to admit that it's pretty clever.  Teigen shared a video of the laminated menu she made to play restaurant with Luna in the hopes she'll feel empowered to order her meal and actually eat.  (Bring on the laminator!)  View this post on Instagram BUYING A LAMINATOR IS THE BEST THING TO HAVE EVER HAPPENED TO ME A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Dec 18, 2018 at 11:02am PST Now Luna gets to play restaurant, which is awesome because according to a recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics, playing with mama will help Luna develop skills like self-advocacy, decision-making, negotiation and a sense of agency. Parents of toddlers know that those skills are important at this stage when kids are wanting to have more independence and control (including at the dinner table). In the video, Teigen says she has a problem—making a laminated a menu of toddler meal options may be a bit over the top—but we can relate to doing whatever you can to try and get your toddler to eat. Having a picky eater can be overwhelming, confusing and sometimes infuriating.  But there's good news for all of us struggling with a picky eater. As pediatric occupational therapist, Ashley Thurn, previously wrote for Motherly, it's completely normal for children around age two or three to start to test their new independence by eating or not eating the meal you set before them. As long as your child is growing and developing well, there is no reason to be alarmed by these feeding behaviors. Feeding disorders (where intake by mouth is severely restricted) are very rare, but if you are worried about your child's food intake, talk to your pediatrician.

"Three more accusers have reportedly come forward accusing former House of Cards star Kevin Spacey of sexual assault.  London’s Metropolitan Police are investigating the actor after men separately reported him for separate attacks that respectively occurred Westminster in 1996, in Lambeth in 2008 and in Gloucester in 2013, according to TMZ.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The Met does not identify people who are subject to investigations until charges have been filed and would not confirm Spacey is being investigated. However, a spokesperson confirmed that officers from the Child Abuse and Sexual Offenses Command are investigating six separate, male-on-male alleged sexual assaults that match the three dates published by TMZ, as well as three dates previously connected to Spacey.  Kevin Spacey Frazer Harrison/BAFTA LA/Getty Images  Spacey’s attorney did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  In October 2017, actor Anthony Rapp claimed Spacey had previously made inappropriate sexual advances toward him when he was just 14 years old.  In response, Spacey, now 58, issued a statement on Twitter addressing the allegations and coming out as gay.  “I have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I’m beyond horrified to hear his story,” he said. “I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”  Several more people accused the actor of sexual harassment or assault since, and in April, one sexual assault case against the star reported to have taken place in October of 1992 in West Hollywood involving a male adult was turned over to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office for further review.  In November, the actor entered a treatment facility. He has not been out in public since and has been written off the finale season of House of Cards.  On Tuesday, actor Guy Pearce hinted at an unpleasant experience while working with Spacey.  “Yeah… Tough one to talk about at the moment,” he said on Australian talk show host Andrew Denton’s Interview, according to Independent. “Amazing actor; incredible actor. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. He’s a handsy guy.”",0
"Postby Guest » Wed May 02, 2018 1:05 pm  By Andrew Shuster | 3:29 pm, May 1, 2018    A tabloid report claiming Brad Pitt is seeking advice from George Clooney on his supposed romance with Neri Oxman is completely made-up. As Gossip Cop has repeatedly stressed, the movie star isn’t dating the MIT professor, so this entire story is based on a lie.    According to Woman’s Day, Pitt is inspired by Clooney’s marriage to wife Amal, a human rights lawyer who works completely outside of Hollywood. Oxman is an architecture professor who also has no ties to the movie industry, so Pitt supposedly asked his friend how to keep her interested once his star power wears off.    As the story goes, Clooney would rather tease his friend than offer him guidance. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “George loves that Brad has been thrown off his game and makes fun of him endlessly. It’s sweet payback for all the jokes Brad tossed his way after George started dating Amal.”    The outlet’s questionable insider goes on to say that although Clooney has been messing with Pitt, Amal has actually been “advising Neri on ways to keep calm and grounded amid the media circus.” The seemingly nonexistent tipster further contends that Pitt “is very grateful” for Amal because “he’s not used to having a non-famous girlfriend and Neri never expected to be in the limelight.”    The tabloid’s article, however, is nothing more than fan fiction. Pitt’s rep has told us on the record several times that the actor isn’t dating Oxman. This has been backed up by trusted publications such as People, which recently noted Pitt and Oxman have a “professional friendship,” as while as E! News, which similarly reported that Pitt and Oxman are “strictly friends.”    This article only seems to exist because Woman’s Day came up with a way to drag Clooney into his pal’s imaginary romance. In addition to the fact that Pitt and Oxman aren’t a couple, a mutual pal of ours and Clooney tells us on background that the actor’s friend hasn’t turned to him for advice about dating the MIT professor. This is just a fabricated story based on a phony premise.    It’s worth noting, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has had to debunk a bogus story about Clooney supposedly playing a role in his friend’s love life. We recently busted New Idea for making up a story about Clooney getting Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together. This latest article involving Oxman is equally untrue.",1

"Kevin Spacey has issued an official statement in response to allegations made by actor Anthony Rapp, who told BuzzFeed News that Spacey made a drunken sexual advance on him when he was just 14 years old. Spacey, who claimed not to remember the incident, said that if he did do what Rapp has alleged, then he owes him the “sincerest apology” for his “inappropriate” behavior. Rapp described Spacey climbing on top of him on a bed at a party in 1986 before he was ultimately able to get away and leave the room. Spacey also took the opportunity to address the rumors about his sexuality, revealing for the first time publicly that he “chooses” to “live as a gay man.” In a 2010 interview with The Daily Beast, Spacey declined to specify his sexual orientation, saying, “No one’s personal life is in the public interest.

"CLOSE Jay-Z's new album ‘4:44’ is basically his reaction to Beyoncé's 'Lemonade.' USA TODAY  As part of his apology tour surrounding his new album 4:44, Jay-Z admitted an uncomfortable new truth about his marriage — and he's getting other male celebrities to do the same.  The rapper is releasing a series of Tidal documentaries digging deeper into specific tracks from 4:44, which dropped earlier this month. The latest video, Footnotes for 4:44, is an 11-minute clip released Monday featuring celebrities including Jesse Williams, Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Aziz Ansari and Mahershala Ali discussing race, relationships and masculinity.  For his part, Jay got candid about his sometimes-troubled relations with Beyonce, after spending a considerable part of 4:44 owning up to the misdeeds she sang about on Lemonade.  “This is my real life,"" he said. ""I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn’t totally built on the 100% truth and it starts cracking.""  ""Things start happening that the public can see,” he continued. “Then we had to get to a point of ‘Okay, tear this down and let’s start from the beginning' … It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”  Elsewhere in the video, Jesse Williams referenced his recent divorce from Aryn Drake-Lee and the cheating rumors that followed.  “I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not five years, not seven years – 13 years,” Williams said. “All of a sudden (expletives) are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.""  The Grey's Anatomy actor called the breakup ""the most painful experience I’ve had in my life, like, with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart,"" and denied the rumors ""that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute.”  Footnotes for 4:44 follows Tidal's previously-released Footnotes for The Story of O.J., which digs deeper into the politically-motivated track.  For Jay fans hoping to see 4:44 live, the rapper announced a 31-city tour on Monday, which kicks off in October.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2uMsLVv",0

"The Golden Globes are known for switching things up compared to other award shows, but that wasn't the case when Sterling K. Brown won the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor In A Television Series - Drama for his role as Randall Pearson on This Is Us. Brown beat out Jason Bateman for Ozark, Freddie Highmore for The Good Doctor, Bob Odenkirk — Better Call Saul, and Liev Schreiber for Ray Donovan. And just like Brown doesn't disappoint week to week on This Is Us, he's also proving himself a force to be reckoned with when it comes to awards show speeches.  Brown was the most obvious choice to win the Best Actor in a TV Drama award, considering in September, he won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. That win made Brown the first black man to take home the award in 19 years. That said, it wouldn't have been a huge surprise if the Globes had chosen a wild card. As Entertainment Weekly noted in their predictions, ""The HFPA loves to honor members of the freshman class,"" which made EW think Highmore was going to win. TV Guide also predicted a win for Highmore, explaining that the category was a ""toss-up"" between him and Brown, but that a win for Highmore on The Good Doctor would be a shout-out to the new show. Meanwhile, TIME predicted Brown's win, noting that he was a sure bet and that the ""HFPA overlooked him last year when he was nominated for The People v. O.J. Simpson.""  Brown gave a funny and emotional speech when he won his Emmy, but it also got a lot of attention because he was cut off before he was finished speaking. Now, Brown has made up for that with his Golden Globes' speech, only four months later. This win was also a historic one for the actor; it made him the first black TV drama actor winner.  He started the speech by simply saying, ""Oprah..."" I mean, she was right there in the audience, after all, and who wouldn't be stunned by the Oprah Winfrey? He soon continued on, though, and made a reference to his Emmy's speech being cut off when he said, ""I don't want to run out of time, so let me thank my wife.”  Brown then went on to thank his kids — ""I will take you to school in the morning, I promise,"" he told them — as well as NBC and his co-stars. But then, things took a more serious turn when he began to thank This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman.  Brown first talked about how he has benefitted from ""colorblind casting"" throughout his career in parts where they would just ""throw a brother in this role."" But what he appreciates about playing Randall, the character Fogelman created, is that it isn't colorblind at all.  ""Dan Fogelman, you wrote a role for a black man that could only be played by a black man,"" Brown said. ""And so, what I appreciate so much about this thing is I am being seen for who I am. I am being appreciated for who I am. And it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or to dismiss anybody who looks like me. So thank you, Dan. Thank you, Hollywood Foreign Press.""  In addition to Brown's nomination for This Is Us, the show was also nominated in two other categories: Best TV Drama Series, which it lost to The Handmaid's Tale; and Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture for TV for Chrissy Metz, who plays Randall's sister, Kate, on the series, and who lost out to Laura Dern for Big Little Lies.",0
"Depending on how you look at it, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are the most famous members of their family. Some favor Kim over Kylie and vice versa, but one thing Jenner has surpassed Kardashian in is her net worth. On July 11, Forbes revealed its new cover for the ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue, and Jenner is front and center. The outlet reports that thanks to Kylie Cosmetics, the new mom is almost a billionaire. People on Twitter started pitting the sisters against each other over their money, but Kim Kardashian's tweet about Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover shows that she's the farthest from jealous someone could get: she's proud.  When the Forbes cover was released on July 11, Jenner posted the cover to her Instagram in a moment of pride. She said, ""wow. i can’t believe I’m posting my very own @forbes cover. thank you for this article and the recognition. I’m so blessed to do what i love everyday. i couldn’t have dreamt this up! #KylieCosmetics."" The article finely outlines Jenner's net worth as a result of Kylie Cosmetics, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, her and Kendall Jenner's PacSun clothing line, and her other various money-making schemes, and she's worth $900 million. Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, is worth $350 million, according to Forbes.  It's not like either of those numbers are small or unimpressive, but nevertheless, people on Twitter started trolling Kardashian and Jenner, many joking that Kardashian must be extremely jealous that her youngest sister ended up more successful than her (money wise).  This is Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover.  And here's what Twitter had to say about it.  Lots of people (including Dictionary.com) are arguing that Jenner isn't self-made at all. I mean... I feel like it's obvious that she's objectively not. She was born into a famous family, was on KUWTK because it was about said famous family. Jenner has 100 percent taken the fame she already had and used it to her advantage better than any of her siblings, but self-made? Nah.  Dictionary.com trolled Jenner in the most savage way when this cover came out.  The account quoted Forbes tweet of Jenner's cover and said, ""Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided. Used in a sentence: Forbes says that Kylie Jenner is a self-made woman."" The (pretty true) shade! Jenner is a hard worker, no doubt, and the success of Kylie Cosmetics is thanks to her, but the literal definition of ""self-made"" consists of not having any help. You can't really be self-made when you're born into fame and then you use that fame to your favor. More power to Jenner for creating one of the most successful makeup companies in the world, but that success is in part thanks to the fact that she was born with more privilege than most.  One person who has no issue with Jenner's success, however, is Kim Kardashian.  Kardashian tweeted Jenner's Forbes cover not once, but twice. Her first tweet said, ""CONGRATS @KylieJenner"" with three flame emojis. The second said ""Wait I'm posting this again just because!!!! BILLION DOLLAR BABY"" with a bunch of emojis. Kim K has no time for people saying she's jealous. (She also posted a video on her Instagram story in honor of Jenner.)  One fan came to the family's defense about their work ethic and the doubt about their success.  The tweet said, ""The Kardashian Jenner women are the smartest, hardest working women that I know. They are the first to start their work day before the sun rises and always the last ones to end it. Debate and hate all you want but their success and longevity is no accident."" Kardashian quoted the tweet with three clapping emojis.  Whether you think Kylie Jenner is ""self-made"" or not, one person we can thank for all of this is Kris Jenner. Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and the Devil may work hard, but Kris Jenner works harder.",1

"Kris Jenner says she trusts Khloe Kardashian with regard to her relationship with Tristan Thompson amid his cheating scandal, as her daughter continues to publicly support her man.  In April, just before Khloe gave birth to her and Tristan's first child together, daughter True Thompson, photos and videos of the Cleveland Cavaliers player with other women were posted online.  Neither Khloe nor Tristan commented on the scandal. A source recently told E! News that Khloe ""is still trying to regain trust with Tristan and figure out how to keep the family together."" Several weeks ago, another insider said Khloe's family members are very angry with Tristan, are ""having a hard time coming to terms with Khloe trying to forgive him"" and ""don't trust him and feel he won't change.""  Kris talked about Tristan while speaking to E!

When asked if she is a fan of the NBA player, if they get along and if he blends in with the Kardashian-Jenner family, Kris said, ""Tristan's, yeah, he's great.""  ""I think you just have to be there for your kid and follow their lead,"" she added, when asked again about the Tristan situation. ""I'm not in that relationship or in that situation, so I really trust Khloe. She's so smart and such a great girl and she'll figure it out.""",1

"Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.    'They’ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions… They don’t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there’s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It’ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection.

"If you've spent hours in the gym hoping to squat your way to a Kardashian-esque butt, you've probably wondered if there's a quicker and easier way.  Turns out butt augmentation is one of the fastest growing cosmetic surgical procedures performed in the country, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Derrière implants increased by 18 percent between 2015 and 2016, while fat grafting procedures (where they literally inject more fat into your keister) jumped 26 percent during the same period.  In total, 20,673 butt augmentation procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2017, per soon-to-be-published data from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Andrew Ordon, M.D., a co-host on The Doctors, even declared 2017 ""the year of the rear.""  Yet Ordon admits not all his patients are happy after having these procedures—and a few have even come back requesting reversals. So is butt augmentation really worth it?  There are a few things you should know before springing for this pricey procedure:  Fat Grafting Is The Most Popular (And Best!) Method  Getty Images  Fat grafting is the most popular method of butt augmentation. With fat grafting, also called the Brazilian butt lift, the doctor starts by performing liposuction—removing fat from an area where it’s not wanted, like the stomach, thighs, or upper back, and injects it into the buttocks. Results are immediately visible, but you won’t see the final product until a year after surgery; it takes time for the body to form new blood vessels and truly incorporate the grafted fat.  There are risks like blood clots, sensation changes, and fat embolism (when fat is released into the blood stream), but most experts advocate fat grafting as the number-one option for butt augmentation. It has a low risk of infection and, if you do gain weight down the line, it will grow with you, says Alexes Hazen, M.D., a plastic surgeon at NYU Langone Health. The average cost of fat grafting is $4,356, per the ASPS; most health insurance companies won't cover it.  You Can Also Opt For Silicone Implants  Getty Images  Very thin patients who don’t have enough fat for liposuction might not be eligible for fat grafting, and these are the women who make good candidates for implants, says Mark Mofid, M.D., a plastic surgeon in La Jolla, California, and an ASAPS member.  Butt implants require a multi-hour outpatient surgery in which a surgeon inserts silicone implants into your tuchus. On butt-implant delivery day, your surgeon will make an incision within the vertical butt crease and then slide silicone implants either into or above the gluteal muscle on each side. Placement technique varies among doctors, but intramuscular implants are ideal, says Mofid.  “Most of the patients who have had implants and are unhappy with them have on-top-of-the-muscle implants,” Mofid says. “That’s just not a great place for an implant to be. Those implants sag over time and kind of look like gumdrops on the buttocks, as opposed to a much more natural look.”  Surgeons typically use the approach they’re most comfortable with, so if you’re considering the procedure, ask your doctor what type of placement he or she uses, he recommends. And, FYI, butt implants cost around $4,860, according to 2016 statistics from ASPS; most health insurance doesn’t cover cosmetic surgery or resulting complications.  The Bigger The Implant, The Bigger The Risk  Getty Images  Most women go into the initial consultation with an idea of what kind of butt they’re trying to achieve, but Mofid cautions against going too large. He says he won’t do implants bigger than 350 cubic centimeters, which equals roughly one and a half cups of fluid—even when patients beg, as they sometimes do—because it’s too “fraught with risks.”  Large implants have higher rates of incisions that split open post-surgery and implants that shift around under the skin. (But more on that next.)  In 2013, Mofid co-authored a study published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery that analyzed the experience of 2,226 people who received butt implants. Among all patients, 848—or 38 percent—reported complications.  The most common side effect reported in the PRS study was incisional separation (7.9 percent of patients)—“people bend and stoop and the incision can separate,” Mofid says. About 5 percent of patients needed an implant revision, and 4.2 percent experienced pain that lasted more than 12 weeks. Nearly 4 percent developed seromas, which means fluid builds up under the skin, and 3.6 percent had minor infection that didn’t require the implants to be removed. Implant removal was necessary in 3.8 percent of patients for reasons like major infection, chronic pain, and chronic seromas, according to the study findings.  Hazen says that plastic surgeons have mixed feelings about butt augmentation, but she’s not a fan. “Just anatomically where they go—you’re sitting on it all the time,” Hazen says. “It’s hard to imagine that it would be comfortable.”  Switch up your squat with these 20 variations that will help you tone your butt:  ​  Recovery is rough—No matter the method  Getty Images  Whether you opt for fat grafting or implants, you can't sit or lie on your back for three weeks post butt-augmentation, says Mofid, which generally rules out things like work and school (and maybe comfortable sleeping). “Normal life is put on hold,” he says. “You’ve got to be committed to this operation. It’s not for the faint of heart.”  If you’re determined to go through with the procedure, vet your surgeon and facility carefully. Check prospective doctors’ websites to see before and after photos of their patients, and talk to other women who’ve gotten implants, Hazen suggests. Always opt for a board-certified plastic surgeon who has ample experience, and be sure to ask questions like how your butt will look over time, whether you’re a good candidate for the surgery and what the options are if you’re dissatisfied with the outcome.  And don’t be lured by unscrupulous doctors or facilities in foreign countries hawking cheaper procedures. “Don’t cheap out and go someplace because it’s inexpensive,” Hazen says. “This is your body, this is forever, it’s important, so go to somebody good. You want an accredited facility, not just the back of some guy’s office.”  Whatever you do, don't get silicone injections  Getty Images  In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning against using silicone injections for purposes like body contouring. The warning was issued in response to an increase in cases of patients receiving illegal silicone injections from unlicensed medical professionals in private homes or hotels. Often called ""pumping parties,"" these services are marketed as a cheaper alternative to plastic surgery.  The risks of illegal silicone injections are even worse than you'd think: Loose silicone—as opposed to silicone used as enclosed implants—can be dangerous and even fatal; injections can cause disfigurement or significant scarring. “It should be uniformly condemned,” Mofid says. “There’s no place for it in medicine—virtually 100 percent of patients over their lifetime will develop problems.”  Squats might actually be your best option  Getty Images  Surgery offers the lure of a quick fix, but it’s risky, expensive, and, well, extreme. Ordon reminds those who crave a larger posterior that they can get one naturally. He recommends performing exercises that target the glutes, such as squats and leg raises. In short, augmentation might seem like a quick fix—but a butt workout is probably still the best way.",0
"For the Kenyan holiday, see Obama Day  Barack Obama Day President Obama Observed by Illinois Type Statewide Date August 4 Frequency annual  Barack Obama Day refers to two days of recognition in the United States in honor of Barack Obama, who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017.  The State of Illinois celebrates the commemorative holiday every August 4, which is Obama's birthday, beginning in 2018. Obama was a member of the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004 and represented the state in the United States Senate from 2005 to 2008 before becoming president. Similar to other commemorative holidays, it is not a legal state holiday, meaning workplaces are not closed on the day.[1]  Perry County, Alabama, has celebrated the second Monday of November as Barack Obama Day since 2009.[2] County offices and schools are closed for the holiday.[3]  History [ edit ]  Illinois [ edit ]  In 2017, Illinois State Representatives André Thapedi and Sonya Harper introduced a bill to designate Barack Obama Day as a state holiday. The original measure would have closed schools and state offices for the day. It was rejected by the House in March 2017, citing expense and the lack of a holiday for other presidents from Illinois, such as Ronald Reagan.[4]  That same year, State Senator Emil Jones III and others introduced Illinois Senate Bill 55, which designated August 4 as Barack Obama Day but did not make it an official state holiday. The bill passed both houses of the Illinois General Assembly with no votes against, and was signed into law by Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on August 4, 2017.[5] The bill amended the State Commemorative Dates Act to include a new section:  Barack Obama Day. August 4th of each year is designated as Barack Obama Day, to be observed throughout the State as a day set apart to honor the 44th President of the United States of America who began his career serving the People of Illinois in both the Illinois State Senate and the United States Senate, and dedicated his life to protecting the rights of Americans and building bridges across communities.[6]  Legislative history [ edit ]  Other recognition days [ edit ]  Since the United States presidential election of 2008, Obama Day is celebrated annually on November 6 in Kenya, the country from which President Obama’s father originated.[7]",1
"Bethenny Frankel & Ex Jason Hoppy Ordered By Judge To Complete Forensic Custody Evaluations With Daughter Bryn  Bethenny Frankel‘s custody war with ex Jason Hoppy is far from over.  After the years it took for the Real Housewives of New York vet to finalize her divorce from the New York native, it appears that the twosome are still battling over custody of daughter Bryn Hoppy. We feel so badly for the seven-year-old.  Related: Stephen Belafonte Claims Ex Mel B Is An Addict  As you may recall, back in December, Frankel sued Hoppy for custody of their shared child. On Thursday, the Bravolebrity faced off against Jason in court, as the two appeared before a Manhattan judge. According to an E! News source, Judge Michael Katz ultimately ruled that Frankel and Hoppy need to get forensic evaluations done with their daughter.  The insider shared:  “Back in 2013 when the divorce and custody initially happened, this same doctor did a forensic custody evaluation at the time. The judge today ordered that same doctor do another forensic custody evaluation to update his first report from 2013. He will meet with Bryn and Jason, and then Bryn with Bethenny ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ separately but in person ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ and observe each of them with the child.”  While we bet Bethenny is annoyed by this legal hoop, it’s certainly a fair way to assess Bryn’s respective relationships with her mom and dad. The tipster continued:  “They are due back in court on May 10th and the evaluations are to be completed by then, that’s why the judge gave them so much time between now and then.”  We can’t blame the Bravo personality for being skittish around her baby daddy. Last October, Hoppy struck a plea deal after stalking and harassing his former flame. The businessman was ordered to comply with an order of protection for six months and obey all laws, and if he did, his case could be dismissed.  The protective order is slated to expire on April 20. Man, oh man.  Hopefully, this family feud hasn’t caused any mental distress for Jason and Bethenny’s innocent daughter. *Sigh*  [Image via Michael Carpenter/WENN.]",0

I decided to do this GoFund Me to help with this childs future.""  He continued, ""I know that money may not be the answer for this problem that we are facing in our communities with bullying. One of my biggest fears as a parent is that my children will be bullied in school. I know its a big task to tackle but it starts inside of our walls and the values that we teach our children. This is just one case of thousands out there. How many of our children stay in silence out of fear for their safety or for the fear of being further unaccepted. Over 3.2 million kids are bullied annually. 160,000 kids on a daily basis skip school out of fear from being bullied. They just want to be accepted and to be able to learn in a safe environment. Im so glad Kim posted this video of her son. It shows how bullying can really impact a child. The video that she posted really touched my heart and felt compelled to help. This is best way that I knew how.""  After the backlash started rolling in about Kimberly, Lam made the decision to pause the GoFundMe page, as he explained, ""As many of you know I paused the donations as well as the comments. As I sit back and read these comments and watched the video again I feel I have to make this update. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE MOM!! However passing judgement on her before you know her is a form of bullying. Condemnation before evaluation is the ultimate form of ignorance. I can't even say for sure that any of whats being said is true. I don't know the family personally and never claimed to have known them.""  He ended the statement by saying, ""I'm hoping that we can turn the money into something good whether it be for private school or college fund. I'm in touch with GFM on how to proceed at this point. Thank you everyone that donated.""  Source: eonline.com",0
"TV  No contestant is going to sing Taylor's songs during the auditions since Katy 'is insisting on a drama-free 'idol'.'  Oct 20, 2017  AceShowbiz - Katy Perry seemingly doesn't want to get reminded of her enemy Taylor Swift any where and any time, including on ""American Idol"" revival. Now that she serves as one of the judges on the ABC show, the ""Swish Swish"" singer reportedly bans the contestants from singing any of Taylor's song.  However, a source explains to Naughty Gossip that it's not because she hates the ""Look What You Made Me Do"" singer, but because Katy wants to keep the spotlight on the show and the contestants. ""Katy wants the show to be about finding new talent not the ongoing drama between her and Taylor,"" reveals the source.  The source continues saying, ""If someone auditioning sings a Taylor song then the whole thing becomes about Katy's reaction, not the person auditioning.""  Katy reportedly ""is insisting on a drama-free 'idol'."" In addition, ""she's not exactly upset that people will be singing her hits and not Taylor's.""  On the revived show, Katy will be joined by fellow coaches Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan. Meanwhile, Ryan Seacrest once again will host the show, which previously aired on FOX for 15 seasons since 2002 until 2016.  Katy was the first singer tapped to be the judge for the new season with a whooping $25 million contract, before the show announced the R&B singer and the country crooner as the second and third judge. ""I am very excited to be joining Katy, Luke and Ryan on 'American Idol'. As a singer, songwriter and producer, I feel I can bring a great deal of experience to the table. It's going to be so much fun!"" 68-year-old Richie gushed in a statement. Meanwhile, Luke said, ""To be in a position in my career to help facilitate this along with the other judges is just a complete honor. It's gonna be a blast!""  ""This is the dream team,"" the ""Bon Apetit"" singer gushed over her co-stars during an appearance on ""Good Morning America"", adding that the three of them clicked from Day 1.  ""American Idol"" is set to premiere in early 2018 on ABC.",0

"Katy Perry, Alyssa Milano, Sarah Hyland and Rob Delaney attacked the bill, designed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, for its approach to pre-existing conditions and funding for Planned Parenthood.  Shortly after the House of Representatives voted on a health care bill designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, numerous Hollywood stars took to Twitter to condemn those politicians who supported the bill.  The Republican-backed measure won by a narrow 217-213 vote, with Democrats singing ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye"" as the bill passed the legislative chamber, suggesting that the GOP's support for the bill would cost them in the 2018 midterm election.  ""I feel so confident,"" said President Trump during a live address after the passing of the bill. ""This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it.""  The bill, which now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain fate, will keep children on family policies until age 26 but will cut the Medicaid program for low-income people and end tax penalties in the Affordable Care Act on the health industry and those who earn high-paying salaries.  The bill will also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year and allows states to get waivers to free insurers from coverage requirements, which could cause them to charge people with pre-existing illnesses higher rates than they charge healthy customers.  In a viral video, Jimmy Kimmel expressed his views on equal healthcare for those with pre-existing conditions such as his newborn son. ""If your baby is going to die, and it doesn't have to, it should not matter how much money you make,"" he said while tearing up during his monologue on his show Monday night.  The hashtag #IAmAPreexistingCondition became a trending topic quickly after the bill was passed. America Ferrera, Sarah Hyland, Mark Ruffalo and George Takei took to Twitter to express their views.

"Just hours after the arrest of the alleged Golden State Killer, actor Patton Oswalt — whose late wife, Michelle McNamara, tirelessly investigated the long-cold case and wrote a book on the murders — appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers, opening up about what he said was her “dream.”  “Her book and the article that led to the book really amped up all the interest in the case and really put a lot of focus on this,” Oswalt said. “Not to discredit all the work that the police and the lab technicians did — it was her dream.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  McNamara was a true crime writer and journalist. Oswalt, 49, recalled, “She always said, ‘I don’t care about credit. I want to know that he’s in jail.’ And now he’s caught, the bracelets are on and it feels like this thing that she wanted so badly is now done. It just feels amazing.”  The Golden State Killer — dubbed as such by McNamara — was allegedly linked by DNA and method to 12 murders, 45 sexual assaults and more than 120 burglaries from Sacramento to southern California’s Orange County between 1976 and 1986 in California.  • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

James DeAngelo Sacramento County Sheriff's Office  Suspect Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested on April 24. He is currently charged with capital murder in four killings: the February 2, 1978 slayings of Brian and Katie Maggiore in the Sacramento area, and the March 1980 slayings of Lyman and Charlene Smith in Ventura County.  Police say, however, that they believe he killed many more people.  Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic  McNamara died in her sleep in 2016 at 46. At the time of her death, she had been working on the book. Oswalt promised he would finish the book for her, and earlier this year, the star — who writes the afterword — released I’ll Be Gone in the Dark with the help of other contributors.  “I was still neck deep in grief and suddenly a single father and not sleeping, but I knew that I wouldn’t be able to live and go on with life if this was left undone,” he told Meyers of finishing I’ll Be Gone in the Dark. “I basically begged [the co-authors] and the publishers to find a way and they were the ones to find a way and finish it.”  Earlier in the day, Oswalt reacted to the arrest in a video he shared on Instagram and Twitter.  “One of the more surreal days of my life,” he said. He added while sharing a series of tweets and videos on Twitter and Instagram, “She would be beyond excited about this. I think this is the definition of ‘bittersweet.'”",0

"The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases.President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address.But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate.""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked,"" Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. ""Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C.""PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked.Go to the pollsUnder current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers.National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples:Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent.Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks""? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent.Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not.So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham’s producers and didn’t hear back.We couldn’t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation.For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll.Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey.This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control.The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict.""People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.Our rulingIngraham said, ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.""Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases.While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings — such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation — there hasn’t been a definitive debunking of the statistic.We rate Ingraham’s claim False.",0
"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Elizabeth Chuck  A woman convicted for her role in the abduction of Elizabeth Smart, who was held captive for nine months when she was 14 years old, was released from prison on Wednesday.  The Utah Department of Corrections said just after 8 a.m. local time that Wanda Barzee, 72, had been freed from Utah State Prison. A gaggle of reporters and news cameras arrived early Wednesday to stake out prison exits in anticipation of her leaving, but Barzee was not immediately spotted.  Minutes after Barzee's release, Smart thanked supporters in an Instagram post, and said she was determined to continue living her life despite her captor being free.  ""May we all remain vigilant in watching over our families, friends, and community from anyone who would seek to hurt or take advantage. I truly believe life is meant to be happy and beautiful, and no matter what happens that will remain my goal for me and for my family,"" she wrote.  In a press conference later Wednesday morning, Barzee's attorney, Scott Williams, said Barzee didn't pose any threat by being out of prison.  ""There is no credible evidence that she is a danger to the community,"" Williams said.  Williams did not answer questions about where Barzee will live or whether she has a support system. He expressed confidence that she could live in society without any problems, but said her biggest challenge, ""obviously, is the high-profile nature"" of the case.  Smart was abducted at knifepoint in 2002 from the Salt Lake City bedroom she shared with her younger sister in a case that drew international headlines. After intense media attention surrounding Smart's disappearance, Smart was seen walking the streets of a Salt Lake City suburb with Brian David Mitchell, a street pastor, and Barzee, his wife.  The couple was arrested and charged in her kidnapping, which Smart has said included repeated sexual assaults by Mitchell. During the attacks, Barzee would sit next to Smart and ""encourage her husband to continue to rape me,"" Smart recalled during a press conference last week.  Mitchell, who prior to the abduction had done odd jobs around the Smart family household, is serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Smart. Barzee was convicted of state and federal crimes, and in 2010 was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison for her role in the abduction.  Elizabeth Smart arrives for a news conference Thursday, Sept. 13, 2018, in Salt Lake City. Smart says it appears there is no viable, legal recourse she can take to stop the release of one of her kidnappers. Rick Bowmer / AP  She received credit for time already served and in 2016, Barzee was released from federal prison but still faced one to 15 years in state prison for a separate attempted abduction of Smart's cousin. In June, her attorney asked that Barzee get credit toward her state sentence for the time she spent in federal credit, but the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied that request — and set Barzee's sentence to go until 2024.  That changed last Tuesday when the parole board announced that Barzee would be released on Sept. 19 — an unexpected move that even caught Smart, who described it as a ""big shock,"" by surprise.  ""I do believe she’s a threat,"" Smart said of Barzee during last week's press conference. ""For me, I know the depth of her depravity.""  The parole board said that after a legal review of Barzee's time served, it discovered that part of the time she spent in federal prison should in fact count toward her state sentence, making her eligible for release.  Barzee will be under federal supervision for five years. Smart's attorney, Brett Tolman, told the Associated Press that conditions of Barzee's release include mental health treatment and an order not to contact Smart's family.  Upon her release, Barzee also voluntarily agreed to not go to any geographic locations that the Smart family might frequent, Williams, her attorney, said. Violating any of those conditions could result in her return to prison, although Williams was not able to say for how long, adding that it would depend on which condition had been violated.  Smart, now 30, has said the couple kept her chained down in makeshift campsites during her abduction — including, at first, one in the foothills just miles from her house. She told reporters last week that she believes in forgiveness as a Christian, but does not believe Barzee has been rehabilitated to the point where she should be freed.  Smart has since become an outspoken advocate against child abduction and sexual violence. Now married and pregnant with her third child, Smart said in an Instagram post last week that she is taking precautions to protect her family but refuses ""to live in fear.""  ""I lived in absolute fear and terror for nine months, no matter the outcome I will not do so again,"" she wrote.",0

"Kris Jenner says her daughter Kylie will not be addressing the pregnancy rumours (Picture: Getty)  Kris Jenner has declared that daughter Kylie will be keeping schtum on the pregnancy rumours for a while yet.  Good guy Tom Hanks shouts everyone burgers at local In-N-Out  The youngest of the Kardashian sisters is rumoured to be pregnant with boyfriend-of-five-months Travis’ baby.  And when Keeping Up With The Kardashians producer Ryan Seacrest decided to probe the momager live on TV during an episode of Live With Kelly And Ryan, he got shut down.  As Ryan and co-host Kelly Ripa were discussing the topic of Kylie’s alleged baby bump when he picked up his phone and sent Kris a text as he ‘had not spoken with the family over the weekend’.  Sorry, this video isn't available any more.  And moments later, he heard back from 61-year-old Kris, who was giving nothing away.  ‘Kris says Kylie’s not confirming anything,’ he told the audience. ‘That’s the news from the family this morning. Kylie is not confirming anything.’  Ryan Seacrest has given an update from the Kardashian household (Picture: YouTube)  The head of the Kardashian household had been quizzed on her daughter’s pregnancy rumours at the weekend during Milan fashion week.  Advertisement  Advertisement  She had said at the time that she was ‘surprised to wake up to the rumours’, adding: ‘It wouldn’t be the family if something didn’t happen every single day.’  A source close to Kris had also claimed that while Kris was surprise, she will support her youngest daughter ‘no matter what’.  Kris was at Milan Fashion Week when news broke that Kylie is apparently pregnant (Picture: Pixelformula/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock)  Ryan’s investigative work comes as the news emerges that Kylie is reportedly desperate for Travis to ‘put a ring on it’ as soon as she’s given birth.  While Kylie, 20, has kept tight lipped about it all so far – apart from a few teasing Instagram pictures and sources close to her family speaking out – it’s believed that she’s around five months pregnant and is due to pop in January.  And it looks like she’s getting her life in order quickly as, according to US reports, she’s already planning an ‘amazing’ wedding to take place as soon as she’s lost her baby weight.  ‘Kylie wants an amazing wedding and wants to be married as soon as she loses all of her baby weight,’ a source told Hollywood Life.  Kylie wore a very baggy tee to support boyfriend Travis Scott at the iHeartRadio gig (Picture: Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock)  It’s claimed she want her baby to have a settled family life and is keen to avoid her first born growing up in a ‘broken home’, hence why she’s so keen to walk up the aisle with her rapper beau.

So to be married is something she wants very soon and she will be very excited for Travis put a ring on it.’  However, other members of the Kardashians apparently think Kylie might be a bit too ‘naive’ to have a baby at just 20.  ‘Kylie is very naive,’ a source told People. ‘Spending time with other people’s kids is obviously completely different than being a mom 24/7. Kylie of course has no idea about all the hard work and sleepless nights.’  Travis Scott performs in April this year (Picture: Bob Levey/Getty Images)  Kylie’s dad Caitlyn was also apparently ‘shocked and disappointed’ at the news.  ‘Caitlyn was really shocked and disappointed to learn that Kylie is pregnant,’ source close to Caitlyn told Hollywood Life.  ‘She thinks Kylie is way too young to have a baby, and that she should have waited until she was in a long term committed relationship.’  Caitlyn Jenner was ‘shocked’ by Kylie’s news (Picture: Getty)  And while Kylie and Travis have not yet confirmed they are expecting, Caitlyn appeared to do it for them on Monday.  While representatives for Caitlyn denied that she found out on the internet, as had been reported, they told The Sun that all they could say is that she was told ‘some time ago’.  Advertisement  Kylie and Travis, 25. met in April, just weeks after she split from long-term partner Tyga, and later that night Tyga claimed that he was the baby’s father, in a now-deleted Snapchat which featured an image of Kylie and the headline ‘Kylie is pregnant’, but Tyga had written over the top of the image ‘Hell nah that’s my kid,’ with four purple devil emojis.  While neither of them have addressed the pregnancy rumours on their social media accounts, the pair have been spotted together in Las Vegas, following Travis’ iHeartRadio gig.  Kylie was noticeably in a baggy grey T-shirt, hiding her stomach. But the question remains: is there a baby bump underneath?

Though Menzel said boys usually tell her they don’t like “Let It Go” and prefer Justin Timberlake’s track from the movie Trolls, Luke couldn’t have been more in opposition.  “Heck to the no,” he replied, shaking his head in disbelief. “I’m offended.”  When it came time to sing the song, it only took a few bars for Menzel and the crowd to realize that he wasn’t just a fan but a full-fledged musician himself.      Menzel offered to let Luke sing a different song since the crowd cheered through his first performance, but he chose to sing through the chorus again, adding in extra frills that even the most shameless of shower singers would be embarrassed to try aloud. Luke even got to wrap up the segment with Menzel, all by himself.  “I can’t sing it like that,” Menzel told the girls on the stage. “I’m gonna try tomorrow, I’m so inspired.”  Luke told news station WFAA 8 that he’d never received a standing ovation before, but he’s already ready for his next performance.  “I know boys don’t like ‘Let It Go’ because it’s a ‘girls’ song,’” Luke said, rolling his eyes. “But I mean, songs are for everyone. It’s music, it’s art.”  Watch Luke’s entire stint with Menzel below:",0
"Doctor Who will introduce its first-ever female Time Lord Doctor, played by Jodie Whittaker, this fall — but the character won’t change too much.  “It’s the Doctor you’ve known and loved, with just a fresh take,” new showrunner Chris Chibnall said at the show’s San Diego Comic-Con panel on Thursday. “The Doctor is still very much The Doctor. But we need a pillar of hope, and that pillar of hope is Jodie Whittaker.”  The actress won over the producers from the instant she walked into the audition room. “It’s one of those things [where] you don’t know what you’re looking for until you see it,” Chibnall described, hailing Whittaker’s performance as “fresh, funny and very emotional.”  As for how Whittaker’s Broadchurch co-star and former Doctor David Tennant reacted to her casting, the actress said the message conveyed to her was, “This is the most amazing thing that can happen to you, and there are only a few people who know how it feels.”  While Season 11 won’t debut until this fall, fans were already introduced to the 13th Doctor in last year’s Christmas special. Shooting the brief scene was “incredibly nerve-wrecking, because the reveal had [already] happened [in the media],” Whittaker described. “You have no idea what you’re taking on… I was nervous to touch anything. I felt as if I was in someone else’s shoes, which is a wonderful way to start this journey. It was amazing.”  The cast and creative team were tight-lipped on specifics about the new Time Lord, but executive producer Matt Strevens did share that “this Doctor is in love with life” and “treats everything with respect and wonder.”  Whittaker will be joined by three new companions, who are all very different, said Mandip Gill (Hollyoaks), who plays one of the pals. Her character, Yasmin, is a 19-year-old who is “whisked away on this amazing adventure with these people, who become her family, and she’s in awe of the Doctor… The dynamic between the three friends is beautiful.”  When it came time to cast the companions, “we were looking for people who have incredible range, because the tone of the show demands everything,” Chibnall described. “And just truth — bringing emotional truth. It’s really important for us this season, especially. There are big emotional journeys for everyone to go on. All of them aced it, and the chemistry was really apparent.”  In addition to its new ensemble, Season 11 will also feature a fresh take on the sonic screwdriver. Chibnall would only hint that “there is a story [about] how the Doctor comes by” this incarnation of the device.",0

Jenner is already a mother six times over and a grandmother to eight beautiful infants, most recently welcoming Chicago and Stormi to the family.  But reports suggest that the famous Momager is looking to adopt a five-year-old boy with her boyfriend Corey Gamble.  A source told Closer Magazine: “Kris has been desperate for another child ever since her eldest daughter, Kourtney, gave birth to her first grandchild, Mason, eight years ago.  “Seeing so many of her own offspring have children has made her broody to have another.”  The insider continued: “Corey’s fallen in love with a five-year-old boy from an orphanage on the outskirts of LA.  “They’re in the process of having all the paperwork completed with the hope they might even be able to take their son home next month.”  Standard Online have contacted representatives for Jenner for comment.

"With Kevin Hart out as Oscars host, the comedian is moving on after a turbulent year.  Just hours after Hart announced he would be stepping down as Oscars host following the resurfacing of past homophobic tweets, the comedian stepped out in Australia looking serious for a series of comedy gigs.  The 39-year-old has had a tumultuous end to 2018 — just a few weeks ago, Hart also had to defend his 13-month-old son Kenzo’s birthday party after he and his wife Eniko were slammed for culturally appropriating Native American culture.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Here’s a look back at Hart’s tough times:  Homophobic Tweets Resurface  After Hart confirmed he was hosting the Oscars on Tuesday night, the Night School actor was scrutinized for previous homophobic tweets he had written in the past.  While many of those tweets are now deleted, Twitter users resurfaced his comments through screenshots and criticized Hart and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (which hosts the Oscars).  Hart did not address the tweets until Thursday in a statement that began with, “I swear man our world is becoming beyond crazy.”  Kevin Hart Dan MacMedan/WireImage  “If you want to hold people in a position where they always have to justify or explain their past — then do you,” he said. “I’m the wrong guy, man. I’m in a great place, a great mature place where all I do is spread positivity. If you’re not doing that, you’re not on my page.”  Hours later, Hart took to Instagram again to reveal the Academy had asked him to issue an apology — which he refused to do.  “So, I just got a call from the Academy and that call basically said, ‘Kevin, apologize for your tweets… or we’re going to have to move on and find another host,’” he said in a video shared on Instagram that he captioned “I know who I am and so do the people closest to me. I’m not going to continue to go back and tap into the days of old when I’ve moved on and I’m in a completely different space in my life.”  He added, “I’m not going to do it, man. I’m going to be me and stand my ground.”  A source familiar with the situation confirmed to PEOPLE that the Academy did ask Hart to apologize.  RELATED: Kevin Hart Steps Downs as Host of the Academy Awards Moments After Refusing to Apologize  Kevin Hart touches down in Sydney, Australia, on a private jet MEGA  Stepping Down as Oscars Host — and an Apology  Just an hour after he refused to apologize, the comedian shared he would be stepping down as Oscars host.  “I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year’s Oscars’s,” Hart tweeted .”This is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.”  In a second tweet, Hart finally issued an apology, writing, “I’m sorry that I hurt people.. I am evolving and want to continue to do so. My goal is to bring people together not tear us apart. Much love & appreciation to the Academy. I hope we can meet again.”  The Academy has not commented on the reaction to Hart’s casting as host nor on his revelation that they asked for him to apologize.  RELATED VIDEO: Kevin Hart Reveals How Wife Eniko Forgave Him After Cheating Scandal: She’s ‘My Backbone’  Defending a Cowboys-and-Indians-Themed Birthday Party  Before stepping down as Oscars host, Hart and his wife were under fire for planning their son Kenzo’s first birthday party with a cowboys-and-Indians theme — which some critics viewed as cultural appropriation.  “Zos cowboys & indians party was nothing but amazing!” Eniko captioned an Instagram photo of the celebration, which was decorated with Native American blankets, cowboy hats and teepees.  Days after his son’s party, Hart addressed the controversy and defended the theme on his SiriusXM show Straight from The Hart saying the backlash was “stupid.”  Hart also explained that the premise of the party’s theme was based on western movies and the couple’s intentions were not malicious.  RELATED: With Kevin Hart Out, Who Could (and Wants) to Host Oscars — From Tiffany Haddish to The Rock  “I’m saying the battle that is ‘assumed’ because of the movies and because of everything they’ve seen, was because of the fights that were between the cowboys and the Indians,” he said.  “This isn’t a racial slur that people are doing and being malicious with. This is a game that’s been played for years,” Hart added.  Aftermath of a Cheating Scandal  In 2017, a close friend of Hart’s allegedly tried to extort him over a video of him with another woman. The actor opened up weathering the storm of his cheating scandal to PEOPLE in September saying the friendship he has with his wife “is insane.”  “Yes, that’s my wife, we’re lovers, it’s a relationship, it’s marriage…but the friendship we have is like no other,” he shared. “Our marriage has been put to the test,” alluding to his infidelity scandal. “It’s the most difficult test ever. And, you know, sometimes those tests come from stupidity. But it’s how you handle it, and how you decide to move forward from it.”  For Eniko’s part, she chose full-fledged forgiveness. “I applaud my wife for just displaying a high level of strength that I can’t even explain,” says Hart. “I applaud her for being my backbone, my support system, and more importantly, taking my life to the next level.”",0

"(CNN) In what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem ""came to stomp"" Tuesday night, calling the President everything from ""Donald the b----"" to a ""racist grandpa"" in an explosive 4.5-minute freestyle rap.  The Detroit rapper challenged his fans at the BET Hip Hop Awards to ""decide who you like more"" -- Eminem or Trump. He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle ""Campaign Speech"" and in Big Sean's ""No Favors.""  ""And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against, and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for it for you with this. F--- you,"" he said toward the end, raising his middle finger.  A request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned.  The latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called ""The Storm,"" comes as anticipation for Eminem's eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump's comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, questioned the President's own patriotism following his attacks on athletes and Sen. John McCain, and in closing, issued a passionate tribute to Colin Kaepernick.  ""I appreciate you @Eminem,"" Kaepernick tweeted, along with a fist emoji.  The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is now a free agent after he rose to national prominence last fall when he refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality. Eminem previously expressed his support for Kaepernick in ""Campaign Speech.""  Here are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear:  1) 'A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust'  Here's the full verse: ""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s--- to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops.""  Here, Eminem is likely referencing Trump's war of words on social media with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as ""little rocket man.""  2) 'Trump, when it comes to giving a s--- you're stingy as I am'  This line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America.  3) 'Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange'  4) 'Cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump'  Here's the full verse: ""That's why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That's why he keeps screaming, 'Drain the swamp,' cause he's in quicksand.""  Here, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President.  5) 'All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm'  ""But this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.""  Here, the rapper slams the President for spending days attacking NFL players who take a knee and escalating the feud as a hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico and a massacre occurred in Nevada. Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster.  6) 'Who's going to pay for his extravagant trips'  Full verse: ""He says he wants to lower our taxes, then who's going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?""  Last month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code.  7) 'Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more'  Full verse: ""Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that's black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.""  Here, Eminem is referring to Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is also the executive chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News.  8) 'This racist 94-year old grandpa'  This line comes before the rapper says Trump is ignoring America's racist past.  9) 'To him, you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured'  ""He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us you b-------, Unless you're a POW who's tortured ... cause to him you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured. That's not disrespecting the military.""  Eminem accuses the President of disrespecting the military -- a charge that Trump recently leveled against athletes who take a knee during the national anthem. In this lyric, he references Trump's previous attacks on Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. In 2015, Trump questioned whether McCain is a war hero, saying, ""I like people that weren't captured, OK?""  10) 'F--- that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s--- balled like Donald the b----'  You can check out hip-hop's strongest lyrics on Kaepernick HERE.",1
"Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova have welcomed twins, according to TMZ. The singer and former tennis pro are first-time parents. E! Online also confirmed the news.  Kournikova, 36, reportedly gave birth to a baby boy, Nicholas, and girl, Lucy, over the weekend in Miami. The couple hadn’t announced they were expecting. Representatives for Iglesias and Kournikova did not return HuffPost’s request for comment.  Despite making themselves mighty comfortable in that public bathroom for Iglesias’ “Escape” music video all those years ago, the pop star and former tennis pro are famously private and rarely appear in public together.  The two have been together since 2001. While Kournikova sported some serious bling on her ring finger in a snap from 2016, they’ve never confirmed that they are married.  A post shared by Enrique Iglesias (@enriqueiglesias) on Dec 15, 2017 at 2:02pm PST  A post shared by 🐾 Anna 🎈Аня (@annakournikova) on Dec 15, 2017 at 1:38pm PST  The couple did, however, share some posts from Miami over the last few days looking happy in the sun.  Speaking with Women’s Health in 2011, Kournikova revealed that while kids were part of her game plan, marriage wasn’t “important” in her eyes.  “I absolutely want to have children, whether I have my own or adopt. I love taking care of people,” she said. “I’m in a happy relationship ― that’s all that matters … I believe in commitment. I believe in being open and trusting each other and respecting each other completely.”",0
"Blake Shelton continued his tradition of trying new things with Jimmy Fallon! The unlikely duo filmed themselves getting their palms read during Tuesday’s Tonight Show and they naturally had some fun while doing it.  “You have a wonderful long life line. He’s got a very nice heart line and that means you would give things to charity,” the palm reader said told Shelton at the start.  “Me being on your show to try to help it, that kind of charity,” Shelton quipped to Fallon.  The palm reader also noted, “You have a nice physique but this part of the hand is a little fleshy, so that means you might be overdoing something in the physical realm – too much eating, too much drinking too much sex.”  When Fallon indicated that Shelton was clearly boozing too much, the country singer instead focused on the final option. Later it was Fallon’s turn to have his palms read.  “Can you tell by looking at his hands that he’s never worked a day in his life?” Shelton quipped.  The palm reader noted that Fallon had three soulmate lines, and Shelton joked, “Your wife, Justin Timberlake, and me!”  The pair broke into hysterics when the palm reader noted that Shelton had recently been “spending some time with a young man.”  “I forgot to tell you this is an episode of Dateline,” Fallon said as they both doubled over laughing.  “He’s holding the cups,” the palm reader said of the young man.  “Yeah, he’s holding the cups of Mike’s Hard Lemonade, whatever you can trick him into drinking,” Fallon joked.  The two pals ended the sketch by grabbing a beer, which Shelton said he saw in his future.  For more from Shelton, watch the clip below!

According to Women’s Day, the actress recently met with Jonathan Wolfe, the high profile lawyer who helped Holmes get custody of his daughter Suri in 2012. The so-called “source” tells the magazine that Kidman has not officially requested divorce papers. Of Wolfe, but she consulted with him “to know where she was” should decide to end her marriage.  “ Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban- Met With Lawyer Katie Holmes ”?:The store’s questionable source says, “ Nicole ” was extremely impressed with how Katie’s divorce and custody battle was handled, and she really liked Jonathan. She feels confident that he could help her win, no matter how unpleasant she may be. “The supposed person said that the couple’s friends are” expecting them to be able to solve “their problems, but a separation may be on the horizon.  “ Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban ”?: The unreliable tabloid hides behind an anonymous informant, but Kidman’s spokesman tells Gossip Cop that there is no truth in the story. We’re told the couple’s marriage is strong. It is also important to note, the publication never bothered to mention the implications of Kidman and Urban’s alleged marital problems. They are said to “fight constantly,” but the seemingly imaginary source gives no further details.  Last month, People published an article detailing “Kidman” and ‘ Urban’s’ “secrets to a healthy and enduring relationship.” The story was based on a handful of recent interviews in which the 12-year-old spouses talked about maintaining a strong bond. Just three weeks ago, for example, Urban talked about his wife and children during a SXWS panel.",1
"Before she walks down the aisle, meet the frogs she had to smooch to get to her prince.  We've met her family, know all about her flawless fashion, applauded her enviable career, and now, as she prepares to become Prince Harry's wife this weekend, we can't help but wonder what Meghan Marke's dating rap sheet looks like? While we all know who Prince Harry's ex-girlfriends are (looking at you, Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas) – Meghan's love life history is still as mysterious as the Crown Jewels. Just last week the mother of all bombshells dropped when it was reported Meghan went on a date with porn star Simon Rex in 2004 when she was an aspiring actress. He's since come out and said it never took off due to his ""garlic breath."" Obsessed with the royals? Like our Facebook page Now To Love Royals for the latest news on your favourite royal family members!  So, garlic breath is obviously not on the agenda but what does Meghan Markle look for in a significant other exactly? ""At the end of the day, if the guy is going to write the girl a letter, whether it's chicken scratch or scribble or looks like a doctor's note, if he takes the time to put pen to paper and not type something, there's something so incredibly romantic and beautiful about that,"" she's told Esquire magazine in 2013. Well, Prince Harry certainly put pen to paper last year when he dropped a ground-breaking statement begging for the media to leave Meghan alone.  We all know who Prince Harry's exes are!  Seeing the world with her man is also a must. ""I always want off-the-beaten-path, Anthony Bourdain-inspired travel,"" she's mused. From Jamaica to Africa, Scotland and everywhere in between, this year alone Meghan and Harry have racked up a hefty collection of stamps on their passport. As for what it takes to sweep her off her feet? She insists a good old-fashioned slice of pizza is the way to her heart - us too Meegs, us too! ""I've had dates at the nicest restaurants, but when you leave, you're starving, and the best part of the date is having a slice of pizza and a couple of drinks on the way home. I think it's important to be able to roll with the punches and enjoy every minute of it."" Well, now we know what kind of man Meghan likes let's take a step back in time and get to know her former flames...  The one before the one: Canadian chef, Cory Vitiello, 2014-2016  Break-ups always suck, so spare a thought for poor old Cory Vitiello, who was reportedly given the flick shortly after Meghan met Harry in 2016. A besotted Meghan even featured Cory on her now defunct lifestyle blog The Tig, but the post has since been removed. The [UK Telegraph] claims the Suits star was an item with the successful celebrity chef for two years and they were together when Meghan hit it off with Harry in July, 2016. At the time, a friend close of the exes addressed speculation Harry could have played a part in their demise, saying: ""I can't comment on that."" Just before they broke up, Cory praised his significant other for working with World Vision. ""So proud of my lady @meghanmarkle being named Global Ambassador for @worldvision #worldwaterday,"" he penned.  Cory and Meghan lived together in Toronto and were said to be together when Meghan first met Harry.  But was it always just going to be a flash in the pan? ""They were a very handsome pair and well suited, but you got the impression it was a sometimes superficial relationship,"" an insider revealed to The Daily Mail. ""Cory was always very focused on his job and his work. In that respect, they both put their careers first. The relationship came second.""  A celebrity chef who can cook a mean carbonara? Almost as good as a Prince!  According to The Daily Mail Meghan, who lived with the foodie in a townhouse in Toronto, was ""going through a tough time with her previous boyfriend"" when Prince Harry ""besieged her with texts until she agreed to a date."" But don't worry about Cory, he's doing just fine! The gun cook is a regular guest star on lifestyle shows and runs a string of successful restaurants in Toronto. ""There's no downside to being a well-known chef. There are thousands of great cooks in the city, and there are chefs who are more deserving of the celebrity than myself,"" he told Toronto Life in 2016 of his high profile. WATCH: Cory talks about his career. Post continues...  The fleeting fling: Irish pro golfer, Rory McIlroy, 2014  Before Cory, there was a Rory! Though never officially confirmed, these two were joined at the hip for a hot second back in August, 2014. Relive their ice bucket challenge video in the player below. Post continues below...  Their ice bucket video was a hole in one! But nothing serious ever eventuated between the actress and the pro golfer.  Romance rumours stepped up a notch after Meghan and Rory starred in a very flirty ice bucket challenge video together. They were also spotted enjoying several cosy dinner dates in New York and Dublin but sources at the time denied their romance to the Irish Independent  After this pic of Meghan and Rory was posted on Instagram, people were convinced they were a couple.  The ex-husband: American film producer, Trevor Engelson, 2004-2013  We like our princesses to be modern and relatable. And Meghan's failed marriage to American producer Trevor Engelson, 41, makes us love her even more – because in this day and age, who seriously hasn't had a doomed relationship. After dating for six years, Meghan and Trevor, who owns his own production company called Underground, became engaged in 2010. In September, 2011, they tied the knot in an extravagant beach-side wedding at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios, Jamaica. There were over 100 guests in attendance and the celebrations kicked on for days (hopefully she'll do something just as fun with Harry.) Their marriage lasted just two years and by September, 2013 they had quietly separated. Sources close to the couple claim Meghan's role on Suits, which is filmed in Toronto, played a part in their demise. ""It put a strain on the relationship. Trevor was in LA making movies, Meghan was in another country five hours' flight away and it simply took its toll,"" a friend told The Daily Mail. Most recently, Trevor was apparently set to cash in on his marriage to a could-be-potential princess with the explosive news he's working on a TV show with a very familiar plot line. According to Deadline, the show, which is not yet titled, will be based on an American divorced mother who moves to London to marry a British Prince. It will reportedly explore the difficulties of sharing custody with the royal family when your ex-wife is married to a Prince. Although the exes don't share any kids, the controversial concept was dreamt up after Trevor was chatting to his fellow producer Dan Farah, speculating what it would have been like if they did have to share custody of children.  ""Me and my lady in London,"" Trevor penned back in 2010 next to this snap. The film producer married Meghan in 2011.",0

"It’s an age-old tradition for men to get down on one knee and present their potential fianceé with a big ‘ole diamond.

ICYMI: 24-year-old singer Justin Bieber recently rekindled his relationship with 21-year-old model Hailey Baldwin and got engaged over the weekend. After his proposal, Justin and Hailey were seen visiting Pristine Jewelers in NYC yesterday (July 11) to resize her ring. While visiting the jeweler, Hailey apparently decided to pick up Justin an engagement ring of his own. Maybe she got him the ring to distract from the Selena Gomez tattoo he still has on his wrist.

"Taylor Swift’s groping trial officially ended Monday after she won her countersuit against former DJ David Mueller, who was found guilty of inappropriately touching the singer during a 2013 meet-and-greet. Following four hours of deliberations, the jury unanimously decided Mueller assaulted Swift and awarded her $1.  As Gossip Cop reported, Mueller’s lawsuit against Swift was dismissed Friday after a judge decided there was insufficient evidence to suggest she caused him to get fired from his radio hosting gig. The former DJ had filed a $3 million lawsuit against the singer, claiming she falsely accused him of grabbing her butt while posing for a photo backstage at one of her 2013 concerts, leading to his wrongful termination from a radio station. The judge ultimately decided that Swift wasn’t legally responsible for Mueller losing his job, but the jury could still find her mom Andrea and radio liaison Frank Bell liable.  The trial continued Monday to address those remaining claims, as well as the singer’s countersuit against Mueller for assault and battery. As Gossip Cop noted, Swift countersued for just one dollar as her lawsuit was filed to raise awareness about sexual assault, as opposed to financial gain. Swift reportedly broke down into tears as lawyers on both sides presented their closing arguments earlier today, the sixth day of the trial.  Mueller’s attorney, Gabriel McFarland, reportedly held up the photo of Swift and his client during his closing statements and asked the jury if the smiling singer looked like she’d just been assaulted. Swift’s lawyer, Douglas Baldridge, shot back during his closing argument that there’s no logical reason his client would make up a story about Mueller grabbing her butt. Baldridge stated, “[Mueller] can’t take responsibility for what he is doing,” before calling the former DJ’s lawsuit “shameful and cowardly.”  Following the closing statements, the eight-person jury consisting of two men and six women exited the court and began to deliberate for four hours. In the end, they unanimously determined Mueller groped Swift and awarded her the $1. In addition, the jurors found that Swift’s mom and Bell both did not do anything improper to interfere with Mueller’s employment. It was a complete victory for Swift’s camp, and a total loss for Mueller.",1

Mirror Online has contacted Gwen's representative for comment.  Last year, her ex-husband Gavin revealed that he and Gwen went through ""so much counselling"" in a bid to save their marriage.  The 51-year-old former Voice coach split up from the No Doubt singer in 2013 after 13 years of marriage. The couple finalised their divorce in April 2016.  Appearing on Loose Women , Gavin said that they had tried desperately hard to save their marriage.  Gavin said: ""We had so much counselling, so much counselling, I could be a counsellor.  “I tried, I tried hard but that’s the way it goes.

"Laura Dern in a still from Twin Peaks. Photo: Suzanne Tenner/SHOWTIME  A few steps in to “Part Six”, we’re finally given some sweet relief. Not only is a cliffhanger from “Part Four” resolved, but we finally have our first look at Diane some 9,926 days after she was first mentioned in the series premiere of Twin Peaks. The moment occurs when Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) ducks out of a rainy, cold night and heads into a sultry bar named Max Von’s, where he comes face to face with David Lynch’s longtime go-to lead, Laura Dern. Now, if you recall, the set up to this began at the end of “Part Four”, when Gordon Cole (Lynch) told Albert that, before they move ahead with their investigation into Cooper’s reappearance in South Dakota, they need to get him in front of one specific person. When Gordon asks Albert if he still knows where this person lives, he responds, “No, but I know where she drinks,” which made me think beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were talking about Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie). Nope. Turns out that Special Agent Dale Cooper’s (Kyle MacLachlan) secretary, who until now has only been seen in the form of a tape recorder, enjoys a cocktail or two herself. But, let’s back up a bit, because there’s a lot to piece together here, including some newly recovered diary pages, which we’ll certainly touch upon..  “Part Six” opens where “Part Five” closed, with an increasingly bewildered Cooper standing near the cowboy statue outside the office complex that houses his workplace, Lucky 7 Insurance. A policeman patrolling the area attempts to shoo him away, but Cooper is unresponsive, tugging at the sleeve of his jacket and reaching out to touch the officer’s badge as if he’s two hours into an acid trip. The cop is nice enough to drive him home and his wife Janey (Naomi Watts) opens the door and confirms it’s her husband. Granted, the fact that she uses her husband’s full name — “That’s my husband, Dougie Jones” — is a bit odd, but the officers don’t appear phased in the slightest, likely because the night itself has been odd to say the least. Soon enough, Janey brings Cooper into the house and makes him a sandwich and even gives him a little bag of chips like he’s a child. She then insists that he go upstairs to say goodnight to his (would-be) son Sonny Jim (Pierce Gagnon), to which Cooper bumbles his way up each step and eventually sits on Sonny Jim’s bed, continuing to munch away on his bag of chips. In a classic case of Lynchian humor, Cooper offers a chip to Sonny Jim, who refuses it, citing his own clean teeth, and slowly places the chip on his cowboy-themed blanket. It’s all so perfectly ridiculous, and also a welcome reprieve from the madness — kind of like the daytime scenes in a horror movie.    It doesn’t last long. Almost immediately, Janey screams for Dougie/Cooper to come back downstairs, and then shows him a file folder that had appeared on their front porch earlier, back when the cops brought him in. Inside the folder is a picture of Dougie and his sex worker pal Jade (Nafessa Williams), who he seems happy to see, saying Jade’s name out loud to an increasingly disgruntled Janey, who is sniffing and shaking like a rabid horse. Watts really shines in this role, and “Part Six” allows her to stretch her comically abrasive legs as a woman unhinged yet still in charge, a familiar archetype of Lynch’s oeuvre. As she prods her husband over Jade, Janey gets a call on their yellow kitchen phone, which is, of course, a landline because, again, what is time? It’s hard to hear exactly who’s on the other end, but Janey quickly lets us know it’s the thugs looking to collect on Dougie’s gambling debt, which has led to over $20,000 in debt. Because she’s all kinds of resilient — could you imagine running that household? — Janey agrees to meet the thugs in a nearby park at “noon 30.” It’s another strange detail that’s so oddly funny.  Following this, Janey implores Dougie/Cooper to finish his work, lest he lose his job, and leaves him with his case files. Before he attends to his work, however, Cooper looks over to see a flash message from MIKE (Al Strobel), who’s in the Red Room of the Black Lodge and feeling around in the air with his one arm as though he’s looking for a hidden window. When he sees Cooper, he pleads, “You have to wake up! You have to wake up!” and then, after a beat, he insists: “Don’t die! Don’t die!” The significance of this scene is to remind us, in case we forgot, that Cooper is trapped in the life of Dougie Jones, so that Cooper’s evil doppelgänger can remain on the loose in this time shifting earthy realm. If Cooper dies, then Evil Cooper, still under the influence of the parasitic Bob, will have free reign. After receiving this message from MIKE, Cooper goes through the claim forms he brought home from work and scribbles all over them with a pencil. He circles some things, draws what looks like a ladder, and then presses the tip of his pencil into a few heavy circles. As he’s doing this, pin points of green laser light — yes, the same green laser light that ousted Tom Sizemore’s character in “Part Five” — appear on the pages, and on his arm, as though it’s guiding what he’s doing.  Now, comes the aforementioned moment, when Albert makes his way in the rain to meet someone at a place called Max Von’s Bar, whose sign looks a hell of a lot like the neon Bang Bar Bar sign hung outside of the Roadhouse in Twin Peaks. (By the way, I’ll now take a few personal liberties in saying that I really wish other recaps of this new season would stop referring to the Roadhouse as the Bang Bang Bar. Have you ever heard a character from the show refer to it as such? No. Then you shouldn’t either.) As previously discussed, it’s Diane, sitting with her back to the camera for maximum effect, with a flapper-esque white blonde bob that slowly turns to greet Albert after he says her name. Everything about this is perfect and it will be very interesting to see what happens when they get her in front of Evil Cooper.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch that is Twin Peaks, Richard Horne (Eamon Farren) is doing drug business with Red (Balthazar Getty) in an empty warehouse riddled with bullet holes. The character Red is one of many seemingly obvious tributes to Dennis Hopper’s Frank Booth from Blue Velvet and his mix of humor and malevolence is very effective. “Have you ever studied your hand,” Red asks Richard while twitching around and performing a series of Elvis-like karate moves. He flips a dime into the air that seems to spin there forever before impossibly appearing in Richard’s mouth, and then back in Red’s hand. This isn’t the last instance of a coin being used as a thematic marker for an important event in “Part Six”. We’ll come across another one with Deputy Hawk later on.  For the first time since Fire Walk With Me, we make our way back to the Fat Trout Trailer Park and see Carl Rodd (Harry Dean Stanton) taking his daily car ride into town. For what purpose, we don’t know yet. A neighbor (played by Jeremy Lindholm) asks if he can ride along and while they sit together, Carl asks him about his wife Linda. It’s hard to not recall “Part One” here, specifically when the Giant told Cooper in the black and white lodge to “remember 430, Richard, and Linda.” Already, we’ve met a Richard of obvious importance (Richard Horne), but no Linda yet. Could this be her? Let’s keep it in mind for later. True to Stanton’s style, Carl lights up a cigarette in the car and, seeing his neighbor eyeing it, offers him one, which he doesn’t take because he quit a year ago. Carl laughs at this and tells him he’s been smoking every day for 75 years, and then flashes his veneers, which, as a person currently trying to quit, enables me to quit quitting myself. Eventually, Carl makes his way to what must be his favorite park bench, where he enjoys another cigarette and a cup of coffee while staring up at the trees. Nearby, a young mom (Lisa Coronado) and her son engage in a strange game of tag and he watches them with a smile.  A short distance away, however, Richard is ramming around in his truck, still enraged from his meeting with Red, and in an intersection that looks exactly like the one where MIKE confronted Leland Palmer in Fire Walk With Me, runs a stop sign and mows the little boy down. He races away and a teacher (Sarah Jean Long), who we earlier saw enjoying two pieces of cherry pie at the RR Diner (in a snarky meta jab at the fans), gets a clear view of his face as he speeds past her. Carl goes over to comfort the mom of the dead boy and sees the boy’s spirit rise into the sky in the form of a yellow ball of light. From here, there’s a cut to a wood pole with the number 6 on it, which is located near his trailer and was previously highlighted in Fire Walk With Me. What’s the significance of spending so much time showing this particular numbered sign? Well, if you read your Secret History of Twin Peaks, you’d know there’s more to Carl than we think (keyword: abduction).  From here, we’re back in the high-rise building, where Duncan Todd (Patrick Fischler), a man presumably hired by Evil Cooper, sits at his desk typing on a laptop. As he’s typing, a red square appears on his screen and he clicks it away and then uses a tissue to retrieve a file from his safe. The file, which he places on the desk like it’s a disgusting turd, has a black dot on it. We briefly flash from here to Rancho Rosa to see the cops investigating Dougie’s burnt up car, and then back to the folder with the dot on it, which a creepy short man in a hotel has now received. Before receiving the file he’s playing some manner of dice game and then marking things down in a notebook, as though he’s calculating the many number of ways the dice can land. Slowly, he removes a picture of Lorraine (Tammie Baird) from “Part Five” and another of Dougie, using an ice pick to stab both in an obscene matter. Of course, it’s a classic case of foreshadowing, as we soon watch the man use that same ice on Lorraine and her co-workers in what’s arguably one of the most violent scenes in the revival so far.  Once again, over at the Lucky 7 Insurance building, the elevator doors open to Cooper, only now he’s in his trademark black suit. Sadly, he’s not back to his true form just yet, but seeing this suit again gives us hope that maybe the days of blubbering Dougie will soon be behind us. As expected, he gets called into his boss’ office, where he’s initially yelled at for scribbling all over his claim forms like a child, but then, after going through them for awhile, the scribbles seem to take on some meaning and his boss actually winds up thanking him. The two end their meeting by “agreeing” to keep this discovery between them and with what might be the weirdest and most awkward hand shake of all time.  Back at the Twin Peaks Sheriff Department, Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse) is using the restroom when a coin falls from his pocket and rolls into a stall next to him. He goes to retrieve it and sees that it’s an Indian head nickel. Remember how the Log Lady told him that his heritage will help him piece all this together? Well, he also hasn’t forgotten and he holds onto this nickel for dear life while, at the exact same moment, he sees an Indian on a manufacturer’s plaque on the bathroom stall door (specifically, his family tribe, the Nez Perce) and knows right then and there that he’s being led to something by the cosmic forces overseeing so many of that town’s many mysteries. He goes and gets a ladder and a tool to pry the top layer of metal off the stall door and reaches down to pull out a couple pages of folded paper. Are these the missing pages from Laura’s diary that are mentioned many times in the original series, as well as Fire Walk With Me? Many signs point to yes, but we’ve been pointed to yes and arrived at no before. So, we’ll just have to wait and see.

Entertainment, he lobbied for the Grammy-winning superstar to appear in Disney’s musical blockbuster.  “I even tried to get her into ‘Beauty and the Beast,’ but it wasn’t a big enough part,” the 61-year-old director said. “She would have been a good feather duster.”  Condon, who worked with Beyoncé, 36, in 2006’s “Dreamgirls,” helmed the live action version of the Disney classic, which has grossed a total of $504 million domestically. The role of Plumette, the feather duster of Lumiere’s (Ewan McGregor) eye, went to British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw.  Though Beyoncé’s resume has grown since “Dreamgirls,” Condon believes the mother of three has an eye for the future of filmmaking.  “You look at something like ‘Lemonade‘: that is brilliant,” he says. “That is a brilliant new direction for movie musicals.”",0
"Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman revealed Tuesday doubters had tried to convince him not to give the superhero an African accent — and how proud he was to prove them wrong.  The 41-year-old American stars in the titular role in the 18th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — the first black superhero to get his own stand-alone movie.  ""There was a time period where people would ask me questions about whether or not an audience could sit through a movie with a lead character that spoke with that accent,"" Boseman said of the east African inflection he gives the superhero — alias King T'Challa.  ""I became adamant about the fact that it's not true,"" he added, stressing that none of the naysayers had come from Marvel itself.  ""The intonations and melodies inside an African accent are just as classical as a British one or a European one.  Boseman was speaking at a Beverly Hills news conference along with director Ryan Coogler, co-stars Michael B Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira and the rest of the cast the morning after Monday's glittering Hollywood premiere.  The actor got his break after a decade as an obscure television and indie film actor when Marvel came calling in 2014 with a lucrative five-picture deal to play Black Panther.  His appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016) brought Boseman his first taste of real fame and his celebrity looks set to skyrocket when Black Panther opens on February 16, followed in May by Avengers: Infinity War.  King of Wakanda  T'Challa, king and protector of the technologically advanced fictional African nation of Wakanda, has been characterised as the first black superhero, which is partly true.  Around 30 black characters have donned the Lycra for the big screen since the early 1990s, including Marvel's Falcon (Anthony Mackie since 2014), Wesley Snipes's titular vampire hunter in Blade (1998) and Halle Berry's Kenyan princess Storm in four X-Men movies.  A post shared by Marvel Studios (@marvelstudios) on Jan 9, 2018 at 10:00am PST  The Wakandan royal can claim to be the first black superhero to land a stand-alone movie in the MCU and the first in mainstream American comics, having been featured in The Fantastic Four in 1966.  Critical and celebrity reactions to Black Panther after Monday's premiere were about as good as could be expected, with reviewers hailing the movie as ""iconic"" and ""astonishing.""  Donald Glover, who is due to star as Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Solo: A Star Wars Story, called it ""beautiful"" while Ant-Man director Peyton Reed said it was ""soulful, thoughtful and of the moment.""  Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, who produces every MCU movie, agreed that the messages of the movie — which posits Wakanda taking in refugees and extending its culture and technology to poorer nations — were particularly topical, but added that most of the script was written 18 months ago.  Badass Women of Wakanda  Coogler and the producers came in for particular praise at the news conference for their decision to feature a clique of powerful female characters — dubbed ""the badass women of Wakanda"" front and centre.  ""I was so pleased that this story … that it supported that. In African culture, they feel as if there is no king without a queen and this story, it highlights the queen, the warrior, the general, the young sister,"" said Angela Bassett, who plays T'Challa's mother Ramonda.  ""I was so proud to have my daughter and my son there last night, because in their faces, in their spirit, they were feeling themselves. They stood taller after last night.""  A post shared by Marvel Studios (@marvelstudios) on Jan 12, 2018 at 9:02am PST  Gurira (The Walking Dead) spoke of her trepidation over having her head shaved to play Okoye, the head of Wakanda's Dora Milaje special forces, but how she saw it as ""subversive in the right way.""  ""In theory, it sounded amazing, and then the day came … It happened. Then you walk into the restroom to wash your hands, look up like, 'What the?'  ""It took a few days … Then the pride started to grow, there's pride around it, and the embracing of this symbol of power and these women.""  ________________  Read more:  The stars coming to Middle East Film & Comic Con this year  Watch: Official trailer drops for Avengers: Infinity War  From Iron Man to Wonder Woman: The endless love affair with superhero movies  ________________",0
"Judge Judy had a big win against the National Enquirer.  The tabloid mag had to apologize to the TV judge after they published a false story claiming she had Alzheimer's disease and cheated on her husband, Jerry Sheindlin, among other accusations like Nicole Sheindlin's step-daughter was facing jail time. They backtracked on all of the incorrect allegations.  The gossip rag wrote a statement titled, “Apology Regarding Judge Judy And Nicole Sheindlin."" Nicole is Judy's step-daughter with her husband Jerry Sheindlin.  The message read, ""We and our sister publication, the National Examiner, recently published articles which stated that Judge Judy Sheindlin suffered from ‘brain disease,’ was ‘fighting’ both Alzheimer’s and depression, and ‘is hiding a heartbreaking medical crisis.’ We also published articles which stated that Judge Judy cheated on her husband, and that her daughter Nicole Sheindlin faced jail time for refusing to serve on a jury. None of these statements are true and we unequivocally retract them.”  It went on, “The National Enquirer, the National Examiner, and American Media Inc., sincerely apologize to Judge Judy.

"Riverdale season two creeps ever-closer, but that hasn't stopped fans from obsessing over every trickling plot and casting detail ahead of the show's return. One in particular: the introduction of new character Toni Topaz, who reportedly gets close to Jughead while he's at Southside High — and causes a rift between him and Betty Cooper, AKA Bughead.  Bughead fandom was already intense, even before fans learned that actors Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart were dating in real life too. Vanessa Morgan, the actress who's playing Toni (and who's also on The Shannara Chronicles), hasn't even appeared on the show yet but is already feeling the Bughead backlash, which sometimes even comes in the form of death threats. Over a fictional couple in a fiction show.  If that seems a little much, Morgan's like, yeah me too. In an interview with Glamour, she shared:  ""I’ve already had some death threats. But the thing is, it's half death threats because they don't want that [actually] happening, and there's half that's just all love. Who knows if [my character coming between Bughead] is even going to happen. People are just jumping to conclusions.""  That is a pretty damn chill response to death threats, but Morgan shares that this hasn't affected her relationships with her actual cast members:  ""Lili and Cole are awesome, and they have been nothing but welcoming to me. It’s great doing scenes with them. I feel lucky that everyone has been so nice. And Madelaine Petsch [who plays Cheryl Blossom] is my best friend in real life!""  With friends by her side, Morgan hopes to focus on what matters most — doing well by Toni and her bisexual representation:  ""I hope the lesson is, Don't judge a book by its cover, by someone's upbringing, or by who they love. I hope people watch Toni and think, Why are we judging people? I would love that if people took that from my character.""    Follow Lilian on Twitter.",0

"Kanye West reportedly thought his marriage to Kim Kardashian might be nearing its end.  The multiplatinum hip-hop hero told the New York Times that he thought his wife might divorce him over the well-publicized comments he made about slavery — saying that slavery was a choice — during an appearance on TMZ.  “There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, ‘Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?’” West said in an interview with the New York Times.. “So that was a real conversation.”  Despite all the controversy West has endured over the past few years, and the concerts (such as the one in San Jose in 2016) where he delivered amazingly disappointing and perplexing performances, West remains a huge commercial force in music  He just released his eighth studio album, “Ye,” which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.  On one of the album’s songs, “I Thought About Killing You,” West raps that he thinks about killing himself. He opens up on the topic a bit more in the New York Times interview, when asked about the song.  “Oh yeah, I’ve thought about killing myself all the time. It’s always a option and [expletive],” he says in the interview. “Like Louis C.K. said: ‘I flip through the manual. I weigh all the options.’  “I’m just having this epiphany now, ’cause I didn’t do it, but I did think it all the way through. But if I didn’t think it all the way through, then it’s actually maybe more of a chance of it happening.”",0
"The Boston Free Speech rally on Saturday has raised fears last weekend's white supremacist march on Charlottesville — and the ensuing violence — will play out in the Massachusetts capital, too. Groups of counter-protesters have gathered under a Fight Supremacy demonstration, including Antifa members, Black Lives Matter activists, and anti-racists across the board. But what does Fight Supremacy want, and what are their goals of the counter-protest?  Well, for starters, the Facebook page for the Fight Supremacy counter-protest has over 14,000 marked as attending. So, in this case, gathering a crowd isn't an issue. As for the protest's objective, organizers shared a handful of clear intentions on the page. Understandably, one of the main intentions is to combat any possible repeat of the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville by organizing a coalition to march against the hate groups. There can be safety, or at least, solidarity in greater numbers.  ""As we have seen with the events in Charlottesville and around the country, white nationalists are emboldened by the current political administration and growing police state. Rallies and marches organized by white supremacists are more prevalent than in recent years, and—as always—it is the most marginalized who are left vulnerable,"" read the Fight Supremacy event page.  In case violence breaks, the Boston Mayor Marty Walsh made it clear he's prepared to shut down the Free Speech rally. ""If anything gets out of hand, we will shut it down,” Walsh said at a news conference Friday. “We’re going to respect their right to free speech. In return, they must respect our city.""  In preparation, there are already 500 police officers deployed to keep the peace. Although, given the fact that police officers stood by while a 20-year-old black man was beaten by white supremacists last weekend, their presence means little to those who need protection the most.  By noon on Saturday, there were already thousands of Fight Supremacy protesters gathered, greatly outnumber the amount of white supremacists who showed up.  ""Resistance takes many forms. One of those forms is counter-protest. Counter-protests send a message to white supremacists that their hateful rhetoric, physical violence, and fear mongering will not go uncontested. It's also a show of solidarity and an opportunity for allies to ""show up"" and wield their privilege,"" wrote the Fight Supremacy mission statement.  Regardless of how the events continue to unfold throughout the remainder of Saturday, it appears that Fight Supremacy organizers have already successfully gathered thousands to counter white supremacists. And that's a feat for such short notice.",0

"Her 'Today' co-anchor Al Roker attacked the ""culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce"" on people over mistakes and called out the New York Times for its participation. ""It's a cheap shot.""  Jenna Bush Hager issued an apology over her Golden Globes snafu on Monday morning's Today.  The NBC News correspondent was covering her first red carpet for the network Sunday when she found herself thrust into the viral news spotlight after interviewing Hidden Figures nominee Pharrell.  ""So you're nominated for Hidden Fences,"" said Bush Hager, mistakenly combining the title of his film, Hidden Figures, with the also nominated Fences, starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. The New York Times' Dave Itzkoff highlighted the moment with a video on Twitter, sparking social media to quickly comment on Pharrell's taken-aback expression.  ""I had an error in the night, which I have to apologize for,"" said Bush Hager, who was joined by Al Roker and Natalie Morales on the NBC morning show. ""When I was interviewing the incomparable Pharrell, who I adore, I accidentally — in the electricity of the red carpet, which I've never done one before — called Hidden Figures 'Hidden Fences.' I have seen both movies, thought they were both brilliant. I've interviewed casts for both of the movies, and if I offended people I am deeply sorry.""  Later in the night, Michael Keaton made the same notable error when presenting the best supporting actress award, sparking the term #HiddenFences to trend on Twitter. While some users posted jokes and memes, others such as Gabrielle Union and Justin Simien noted their disappointment about the confusion and comedian-actress Robin Thede said, ""All movies with black people don't sound alike.""  ""It was a mistake, because ya'll know I'm not perfect,"" continued Bush Hager, who at this point began to choke up and get teary-eyed. ""I am authentic, but a human. And what I didn't want to do is make anyone lesser than who they are. I apologize to both the cast, to Pharrell, but it was a mistake and I hope we can move on.""  Both Roker and Morales swooped in to defend Bush Hager, with Roker blasting the ""culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce on people"" for what he said is a common mistake for live TV broadcasters.  ""We've all been in live situations and you make a mistake,"" said Roker, adding how he forgot Braveheart when he was interviewing Mel Gibson and referred to Jessica Biel as Jessica Alba during his Sunday interviews. ""Honest mistakes happen in live television and this culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce and get on people, it's got to stop. It's got to stop somewhere, because it's pretty ridiculous.""  He then chided The New York Times.  ""For The New York Times to pile on and repeat these tweets, it's a cheap shot,"" said Roker.  Bush Hager conceded that she has thick skin, but ""to act as though I don't care about people really hurt,"" prompting Morales to point out the red-carpet chaos.  ""It's like a mosh pit,"" she said. ""You're getting celebrities coming at you from all directions. It's a lot happening at the same time, and I think you had just interviewed the cast of Fences also, I think you were just right there in the moment, so it happens.""  But Bush Hager wouldn't cop to the excuse and ended with more of her apology.  ""I know how brilliant those films are and I did not want to make anyone feel lesser,"" she said.  Shortly after the segment aired, Hidden Figures star Octavia Spencer took to Twitter to say she accepted Bush Hager's apology. ""We all make mistakes, hon! Thanks for your apology!"" she tweeted.  Hidden Figures co-star Janelle Monae and director Theodore Melfi ‏also accepted Bush Hager's apology on Twitter.

Blessings, Ted — Theodore Melfi (@theodoremelfi) January 9, 2017  Later, Pharrell himself took to Twitter to tell Bush Hager that ""everyone makes mistakes."" He also joked that ""Hidden Fences does sound like an intriguing movie.""  Don't worry @JennaBushHager!Everyone makes mistakes. Hidden Fences does sound like an intriguing movie though. Just saying... — Pharrell Williams (@Pharrell) January 9, 2017  Also on Monday, Hidden Figures beat out the reigning Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at the weekend box office, coming in at No. 1 with $22.8 million.

"No, Anastasia is not a Disney princess.  Despite the animated character's now canonical status among fans of Disney's princess films of the '90s, Anastasia hit theaters as part of the debut of Fox's animation studio on Nov. 21, 1997. The story is loosely based on the historical mystery revolving around the disappearance of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna after a fateful night in 1916. Fox had previously adapted the story into a live-action film starring Ingrid Bergman and Yul Brynner in 1956.  Anastasia went on to earn $139 million, receive two Oscar nominations and even inspire a stage adaptation of the musical film that premiered on Broadway in April 2017.

"After Selena Gomez quickly rebounded with her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber after splitting from The Weeknd in October, fans and even her loved ones wondered why she was giving the “Sorry” singer another chance — and if there was any drama with the R&B singer.

We ended it as best friends, and it was genuinely about encouraging and caring [for each other], and that was pretty remarkable for me.”  Selena Gomez Billboard  Sources previously told PEOPLE the pair’s relationship became difficult because of The Weeknd’s touring schedule and Gomez’s shooting commitments for her upcoming Woody Allen film.

"When members of the royal family tie the knot, there’s a lot at stake—including a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  This is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.  “I don’t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,” says Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love. “It’s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.” Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen’s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.  Yes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn’t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. “You wouldn’t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it’s not Harry’s,” says Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story.  Larcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series.  If Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they’re not legally enforceable.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  And though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII’s habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. “In the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,” Larcombe says, “and the person who is departing the royal family, they’re just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they’re done behind closed doors.”",1
"The moment we’ve been waiting for all week has arrived: Harry Styles did Carpool Karaoke, and it actually drove us wild. (Because it’s a CAR-pool and you DRIVE cars…sorry.)  All week, Harry Styles has been joining James Corden on the Late Late Show. The singer has been juggling, performing hilarious skits about singing, and even taking over the opening monologue (complete with some rather epic dad jokes).  What’s more, Harold has performed a few of the tracks from his debut solo album, which was released last week, including “Sign of the Times,” “Carolina,” “Kiwi,” and “Two Ghosts.”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLGsNnt3r9E  To close off his residency, Harry Styles joined James Corden on his journey into work for one EPIC Carpool Karaoke.  Of course, this isn’t Harry’s first time helping James with his commute. The British singer has previously appeared on Carpool Karaoke with One Direction. But as we’ve come to expect, Harry and James make their way through some musical hits, including Harry’s songs “Sign of the Times” and “Sweet Creature,” as well as OutKast’s “Hey Ya” and Diana Ross and Lionel Richie’s “Endless Love.”  After completing “Sign of the Times,” Harry revealed that the track actually makes him a bit emotional, and that he’s cried “in a cool way” after performing the song live.  James also compliments the singer on his effortless style, with the pair switching outfits (Harry even ends up wearing a skintight, gold lamé shirt and string vest!).  Things really heat up, however, when Harry Styles and James Corden decide to recreate some famous scenes from romantic movies.  As we know, Harry is a HUGE fan of rom-coms, but we didn’t expect him to be *this* good at it. He expertly does Julia Roberts’s role in Notting Hill, and the pair even do Kate Winslet’s “draw me like one of your French girls” scene from Titanic.  Watch Harry Styles and James Corden’s incredible and hilarious Carpool Karaoke below.  Omg! After watching this, we’re convinced that Harry needs to do a romantic comedy (hey, he is an actor now). We can picture it already. He could even provide the soundtrack.  Someone make this happen!  Meanwhile, Harry Styles’ self-titled debut album is out now.",0
"The Duchess of Sussex has joined her husband and the Queen for the Queen's Young Leaders Awards in Buckingham Palace. This marks her first time attending the ceremony, which honors young people for leadership and service in their communities.  For the event, Meghan Markle donned a light pink Prada short sleeve top and skirt set adorned with double-breasted button down the front. The Italian designer is a departure from her go-to label, Givenchy, who she previously wore at royal events including her wedding to Prince Harry. She accessorized today's look with black Aquazzura pumps and a Prada clutch.

It's the latest in impressive looks from the Duchess, who continues to impress even without a stylist, Vanity Fair reports. However, she does get style advice from Prince Harry, who occasionally weighs in on her looks.  YouTube  Getty Images  The Duchess sat intently in the front row as her husband gave a speech and while the Queen honored the young recipients. As the Duke of Sussex addressed the crowd, he mentioned that his wife would be joining in on the work.  ""I, together with my wife Meghan, look forward to convening young people from around The Commonwealth to hear your ideas, work with you to build platforms for you to collaborate and form partnerships, as we travel around in our work, he said, per royal commentator Omid Scobie.  Getty Images  Today's awards also marks another event hosted by the Queen and Markle, following their day of joint engagements in Chester, England earlier this month. That time, however, Prince Harry wasn't present.  Aside from official business, Markle has also attended events with the Queen and the rest of the royal family, such as the Royal Ascot last week and Trooping the Colour, which honors Her Majesty's birthday, earlier this month.  The @QueensLeaders award winners arrive in the ballroom: pic.twitter.com/avQEhtf0Ay — Emily Nash (@emynash) June 26, 2018  The Queen's Young Leaders Awards were created in 2014 to honor exceptional young people across the 52 nations of the Commonwealth, according to the royal family's website. Hundreds of people apply every year. By now, the program has created a community of 240 individuals.  Her Majesty awards the recipients with medals then hosts a reception at Buckingham Palace. At last year's awards, a dinner followed at London's Australia House, which Prince Harry attended. Perhaps this time Markle will be by his side.  From fighting for gender equality to tackling climate change, the #queensyoungleaders have received their Awards from HM The Queen for the amazing things they’re doing to improve the lives of others. Congratulations to each and every one of them. pic.twitter.com/O31SSRBAg4 — DiamondJubileeTrust (@qejubileetrust) June 26, 2018  The Sussexes weren't the only celebrities at the event; David Beckham was also in tow, looking dapper as ever.

"Brad has been back on the scene, apparently (picture: Shutterstock)  Brad Pitt and wife Angelina Jolie announced their split in September 2016, however reports have emerged old mate Pitt has been ‘quietly dating’ since rejoining the single sphere.  It comes as he apparently also enjoyed a ‘secret meeting’ with ex-wife Jennifer Aniston, following her split with Justin Theroux.  There’s so much to unpack here.  Anyway, according to Entertainment Tonight, Brad has been dating women ‘not in the public eye’ as he tried to keep his private life just that.  A source explained to the website: ‘He’s very private about who he’s seeing, but he does continue to casually date.’  Angelina and Brad announced their shock separation in 2016 (Picture: Matt Sayles/Invision/AP, File)  The insider told Entertainment Tonight the father-of-six – Shiloh, 11, Maddox, 16, Vivienne, nine, Zahara, 13, Pax, 14, and Knox, nine – has ‘made changes in his life’ since he and Ange parted ways.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ‘When they first split he spent a lot of time at home and was often very down about what was going on. He was a homebody for many months, but in the last month or two, he’s been going out more,’ they said. ‘He enjoys going out to eat with close friends.’  Sounds like a blast.  The publication added: ‘He is in no way ready to get serious with anyone. He invites his dates over to his house and never takes women out in public. While it’s been a year and a half [after their split], it still feels too soon to him.’  Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston at the premiere of Rock Star in LA in 2001 (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)  It comes following this reported secret rendezvouz with Jen that reportedly also had Brad’s mother quite excited.  It was reported last week that the pair had enjoyed a ‘secret meeting’ which was ‘very relaxed and low-key’ for a nice catch up.  A source claimed it ‘seemed just like old times, but better,’ according to US magazine Star.  An insider has now said his mum is all for the reunion, as she was always a big fan of Jen’s.  ‘Brad‘s mom Jane has always had a soft spot for Jennifer, even after the divorce they kept in touch for years,’ they told HollywoodLife.com. ‘She hated the way things ended between Brad and Jen so it’s a big relief that they‘ve mended fences.

"About 10 years ago, at the after-party for a wine auction in New Orleans, a woman in her 20s walked up to Mario Batali to introduce herself. As a chef, she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry. When they started talking, she recalls, she realized that he’d been drinking and he became what she characterized as “creepy” — “just giving me this provocative, icky feeling.”  Minutes into their conversation, she recalls, he told her, “Come work for me, I’ll pay you double what you’re making.” Moments later, someone bumped her glass, spilling wine all over her chest and down her scooped-neck shirt. She alleges that Batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like, “Let me help you with that,” as he groped her chest. “He just went to town, and I was so shocked,” the chef says. “Jaw on the ground, I just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away.”  The chef is one of four women who allege that Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades. Three of the women worked for Batali in some capacity during their careers. One former employee alleges that over the course of two years, he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body. Another former employee alleges that he groped her and that, in a separate incident, he compelled her to straddle him; another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party, though she no longer worked for him at the time. The woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for Batali, though she works in the restaurant industry.  Batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago. According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group — the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich — in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company.  In a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show “while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” a spokesperson said.  Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they “match up” with ways he has behaved.  “I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family.  “I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won’t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there.  ""I know my actions have disappointed many people. The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team. The failures are mine alone. To the people who have been at my side during this time — my family, my partners, my employees, my friends, my fans — I am grateful for your support and hopeful that I can regain your respect and trust. I will spend the next period of time trying to do that.”  Batali remains an owner of his individual restaurants, according to the B&B spokesperson. In a statement to Eater, B&B said that while the company has had sexual harassment training and policies for more than 10 years, it will now also enlist an independent, outside corporate investigations firm for any staffers wishing to make claims against owners of the restaurants.  “We take these allegations very seriously. We pride ourselves on being a workplace for our employees where they can grow and deliver great service with equal opportunity and free from any discrimination. We have strong policies and practices in place that address sexual harassment. We train employees in these policies and we enforce them, up to and including termination,” B&B’s statement reads in part. “Mr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company’s operations, including the restaurants, and has already done so.”  Joe Bastianich said in a statement, “Right now, I’m just focused on ensuring that our more than 1,000 employees continue to have a safe and positive work environment.” An ABC spokesperson said in a statement, “ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.”  Although B&B has been sued for sexual harassment before, Batali’s own alleged inappropriate sexual misconduct has not previously been the subject of a lawsuit. Each of the women who spoke to Eater asked to remain anonymous in part for fear of retaliation — Batali, a celebrated and powerful chef, holds enormous sway in the restaurant world and beyond. Eater is granting them anonymity but has corroborated their stories with friends, family members, or colleagues who were informed of the incidents, as well as with publicly available information.  Many of the people who spoke with Eater said they were afraid of retribution for speaking out. A woman who claims she was inappropriately touched while she worked for Batali in the late ’90s told Eater, “He has clear intent on being threatening when he is wronged. And the level of vindictiveness is very chilling. So, it never occurred to me to share tales out of school.”  The multiple accusations of inappropriate touching and other misconduct emerged from an Eater investigation that included interviews with dozens of industry professionals who have had interactions with the chef, including nearly three dozen current and former Batali employees.  Batali, who became a star as the host of one of Food Network’s first hit TV shows, Molto Mario, has risen to the very top of the restaurant industry since starting out in a New Jersey sandwich shop in the early ’80s as a college student. Along with Joe Bastianich and Lidia Bastianich, he is the force behind Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, which notably includes the New York City restaurants Del Posto and Babbo, each of which holds one Michelin star. Five years ago, B&B reported more than $250 million in annual revenue. Batali is also a minority shareholder in the Italian-market chain Eataly USA, which has six locations across the country.  Outside of his restaurants, Batali is the author of numerous cookbooks, the face of nationally distributed jarred pasta sauces and other kitchen products, and the jolly, orange-Crocs-wearing co-host of ABC’s daytime talk and cooking show The Chew. He also founded a child education and empowerment nonprofit and is active in (RED), the nonprofit founded by celebrities Bono and Bobby Shriver. Additionally, Batali owns a small percentage of Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield’s landmark gastropub, The Spotted Pig. People Eater spoke to within the industry often describe him as a friendly, charming, professional, supportive, and frequently generous person.  But his affable persona belies another, more crude reputation, according to dozens of interviews. Batali’s lewdness, his crass way of speaking about women, and his focus on women’s bodies have been well known within certain circles in the restaurant world, according to people who spoke with Eater.  A former server at Pó, the now-shuttered West Village restaurant where Batali built his reputation throughout the ’90s, alleges that repeated physical harassment took place while Batali was the chef.  Steve Crane, who co-owned Pó with Batali until the chef decamped to start his future empire, confirmed that he was told by multiple staff members of ongoing inappropriate behavior by Batali. Though Crane does not recall any specific details, and was not in the kitchen to personally witness the incidents, he said that he was told by several female staffers that Batali had grabbed them from behind, consistently made a variety of sexual comments, and engaged in behavior like snapping bra straps. “I made it very clear to him that he needed to stop, but I feel ashamed that this happened at Pó, and my staff endured this behavior,” he said. Crane said that because they were partners in the restaurant, he ultimately did not have the power to fire Batali. (Batali, through a spokesperson, denied that Crane ever confronted him.)  The former server alleges that on multiple occasions Batali grabbed her from behind “like a linebacker, like a disgusting bear hug,” and pressed her body against his. In hours of interviews with Eater, she described nearly two years of inappropriate behavior. The grabbing would often occur while they were alone in a cramped passageway between the dining room and the kitchen, she alleged. “He would breathe on me — and sometimes take a deep inhale, like he was smelling me,” she recalled.  When Crane asked Batali to stop, Batali would become more aggressive, the server alleged; some female staff eventually started asking Crane to not confront Batali with their complaints, she added. (Crane confirmed that after some women would complain, they would ask him not to confront Batali because he would only be more aggressive toward them.)  Restaurant culture in the ’90s was generally known for being “bawdy,” and sexual relationships between staff weren’t uncommon, the former server said, but Batali’s behavior was more about degradation than good humor, she alleges: ""This wasn't just some dirty jokes, this was mean, this was about asserting power. He is awful.""  Lee McGrath, a chef who joined Pó a few years after Batali left as chef, told Eater that when he was hired, Crane warned him, “Don’t even think about messing with the waitresses — they’ve been through hell with Mario.”  A different woman, who worked for Batali in the late ’90s, alleges that he touched her inappropriately on two different occasions. The first incident allegedly took place soon after she started her job. One day, while she was in the dining room of the restaurant, she said, Batali came up behind her, catching her unaware, and “put his hand on half of my butt and he squeezed it.” She recalled later gently confronting Batali, who responded, “What are you, a lesbian?”  In a second incident that took place about three years later, she alleges that while working next to Batali in a small, boxed-in space, he was seated in such a way that he blocked her exit. When she had to get up, he refused to move — leaving her no choice but to straddle him in order to leave the space. According to the woman, she told Batali that she needed to go to the bathroom. Batali, who was reclining with his legs propped up, allegedly told her, “If you want to get up, you’re going to have to climb over me.” When she returned, he was still seated with his legs propped up, again refusing to move; she had to straddle him a second time, she alleges. “It was disappointing, again, to have that happen. And, again, humiliating,” she said.  Yet another woman who worked for Batali for about a year in the late aughts alleges that he lunged at her and grabbed her breasts during an industry party in 2011, a few years after she stopped working for him. At the party, she recalled that Batali appeared drunk, and she became concerned for his safety when she spotted him on a balcony standing slumped over. “When I noticed that he looked wobbly, my instinct was concern,” she said. When she walked over and tapped him on the shoulder, “he sprung up, like he was startled,” and with his eyes wide open. Then, immediately, “he lifted his arms straight up and grabbed both of my breasts,” she said. “I took a step back and I pushed him away, and when I did that, I remember he said, ‘Oh, come on.’”  “In that moment I realized, ‘I’m just a body [to him],’” she said of the experience. Though at the time, she no longer worked for Batali, she had worked for him a few years prior and said she believed they shared some mutual respect. “When I’ve seen him over the years, I don’t have a sense that he even remembers,” she said, though she added, “I haven’t spoken to him about it.”  The chef who alleged being groped at an industry party in New Orleans about 10 years ago, as described earlier, said she remains appalled by his behavior. “He gets wasted, he’s arrogant, and he acts like he’s God’s gift to women,” she said. “This is still your industry, you’re a leader in this industry — if you behave this way, what kind of example are you setting?”  In addition to the allegations of improper physical contact, several sources said that Batali has a reputation for inappropriately using sexual innuendo in workplace conversation. Multiple people who work at or have worked at Batali restaurants from the early ’90s to now described behavior that ranges from mild creepiness to more severe misconduct, both in interviews with Eater and in publicly available documents.  The woman who was allegedly groped by Batali on the balcony told Eater, “I remember not being fully surprised that it happened because I’d seen him drunk and flirtatious with women. And that flirting came in the form of talking and sitting really close. I’d never witnessed anything during work hours; it was always post-work.”  But according to other interviews, his inappropriate behavior happened at work, too. McGrath, the Pó chef who started about a year after Batali left, said that he eventually understood why he was given the warning to not harass the female waitstaff, as two servers, including one who spoke with Eater, began to relay accounts of Batali’s misconduct. “It’s like they had PTSD,” he said. McGrath remembers being told that there was a lot of “hugging from behind” and that Batali would ask about their sex lives, what color underwear they wore, and other inappropriate questions.  Another former female Pó staffer, who worked at the restaurant earlier than the woman mentioned above, said that Batali could be generally “nasty” and a “bully” to both men and women. He was “constantly making overtly sexual and inappropriate” comments, she alleges. Though she doesn’t remember physical touching, she said that she’s never worked for someone more inappropriate than Batali. At one point, she wanted to take out an ad in the paper to say what “an awful person he was” because she thought it was unfair that he was getting so many accolades considering how terribly he treated people, she said. “Mario is smart and he’s talented, but I don’t think that gives you the right to be disgusting,” she said.  The employee who Batali allegedly groped shortly after she was hired said that she has witnessed “a lot of gray-area affection with women,” like “a lot of subliminal dissection of women’s bodies, telling women their asses looked good, remarking on boobs.”  The chef’s boorish side has also been previously documented in the media. In the 2006 book Heat, the writer Bill Buford provides a glimpse at the earlier years of Babbo and Batali’s tenure on the Food Network, noting crass behavior with two female prep chefs, as well as an assistant and a set manager. In one incident detailed in the book, during a food- and wine-filled evening at Batali’s Greenwich Village trattoria Lupa Osteria Romana, Buford writes that Batali said to a female server: “It’s not fair I have this view all to myself when you bend over. For dessert, would you take off your blouse for the others?”  A manager at a B&B restaurant said that while he loves working for Batali — who has been good to the kitchen staff and very professional with both male and female chefs, in his experience — he has seen Batali treat women outside of the kitchen crudely, especially while intoxicated. Eater granted him anonymity, as he is still employed by the company and fears losing his job. “I really like the guy, and every sober interaction has been very professional, but, yeah, he’s gross,” the manager said.  “He was always friendly, but it was in this ‘Oh, you’re a pretty little girl’ kind of way,” Gabriela Acero, a former maitre d’ and floor manager who worked at Batali’s Greenwich Village restaurant Otto from 2012 to 2014, said. “I remember him complimenting my dress, saying something like ‘Oh, don’t you look like the blossoming bosom of spring.’ Even then I was like, ‘Oh, Jesus.’”  Batali’s reputation has left some of the women who’d benefited from his power and influence with mixed feelings about their relationship with him. He’s championed the careers of numerous women; his kitchen at Del Posto is led by a female executive chef and executive pastry chef. (“It’s not because they have a vagina,” he said of the crew while at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in October. “It’s because they’re the smartest people for the job.”)  “I feel very complicated feelings toward him,” the former employee who described two encounters with Batali said. “In some ways, he was very supportive and he used his power and influence to connect me.”  The former employee who alleged having her breasts grabbed described working for Batali as frequently professional. “I definitely felt way more reverential about him then than I do now,” she said.  These allegations come as dozens of prominent and powerful men have been toppled by accusations of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct. In the restaurant industry — notorious for its boys-club culture — chef John Besh was brought down by allegations of rampant sexual harassment in his restaurants, and former Jean-Georges pastry chef Johnny Iuzzini has been accused of sexual harassment by four women.  “I think it says so much about how we just accept and move on, and I think for a long time, I just thought, ‘Well, he didn’t rape me,’” said the woman who alleged being grabbed at an industry party in 2011. “But I remember it vividly, it impacted me, and I feel uneasy recalling it. I just feel this major sense that I’m not the only one. I feel really grateful for the cultural reckoning that’s happening.”  Anyone with information about alleged misconduct in the restaurant world can contact Eater at tips@eater.com or via these secure methods.",0
"UPDATE, WRITETHRU with more detail: Shortly before he was due to appear on ITV’s Good Morning Britain today, Ewan McGregor pulled out of the interview, citing comments made about this weekend’s Women’s March by host Piers Morgan. A supporter of President Donald Trump, Morgan yesterday on the program described some of the women who marched as “rabid feminists” and said he didn’t “see the point of the march(es)” which he called “generic” and “vacuous.”  On Twitter this morning, McGregor, who is out promoting Trainspotting sequel T2: Trainspotting, wrote, “Was going on Good Morning Britain, didn’t realise Piers Morgan was host. Won’t go on with him after his comments about #WomensMarch.”  Was going on Good Morning Britain, didn’t realise @piersmorgan was host. Won’t go on with him after his comments about #WomensMarch — Ewan McGregor (@mcgregor_ewan) January 24, 2017  On his Twitter account (whose timeline photo is of he and Trump), Morgan responded by saying McGregor is “just an actor after all.”  Sorry to hear that @mcgregor_ewan – you should be big enough to allow people different political opinions. You’re just an actor after all. — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 24, 2017  Morgan also tweeted he expected McGregor was reacting to his Monday column in the Daily Mail in which he called himself “a feminist,” but decried comments made by Madonna on Saturday saying, “I can’t abide the feminazis, the radical, extreme feminists like Madonna.”  On Tuesday, Morgan took to the middle-market UK tabloid to launch a vicious attack on McGregor where he referred to the actor as “unprofessional” and “disingenuous.”  “An actor who had contractually agreed to appear on a TV show to promote his new film pulls out at the last minute because he doesn’t like the political opinion of one of the presenters,” said Morgan.  Morgan said that after scrolling through McGregor’s Twitter feed, it “revealed a man absolutely enraged by both Donald Trump’s ascent to the presidency, and by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.” He added: “His fury at the latter may strike some as slightly disingenuous given that McGregor himself quit the EU years ago to go and live the life of a pampered millionaire movie star in Hollywood. But I’ll leave others to decide whether that is hypocritical or not.”  The presenter continued his tirade by taking a swipe at celebrities who take the podium to make “political statements that remain unchallenged,” which he says was “typified by Meryl Streep’s extraordinarily pompous and elitist anti-Trump speech at the recent Golden Globes.”  Morgan even suggested that those who voted for Trump or for Brexit to “now boycott his movies” before criticizing McGregor for being “paedophile-loving” due to the fact he worked on Roman Polanski’s film The Ghostwriter.  A spokesperson for Good Morning Britain told the BBC today that McGregor “came into GMB this morning to be interviewed about his new film but decided not to go ahead with it.”  Per the Guardian, Morgan said on the telecast this morning, “Sorry that Ewan McGregor’s not here. He couldn’t bear the thought of being on the sofa with me because he doesn’t agree with me about the women’s march… I have to agree with what an actor thinks about a particular issue because they’re actors. And as we know actors’ views are more important than anybody else’s.”  McGregor’s daughters had marched on Saturday.  I’m with you in spirit today women of the world. My daughters are marching. I’m so proud to see this extraordinary power. — Ewan McGregor (@mcgregor_ewan) January 21, 2017  The long-awaited Trainspotting sequel reunites director Danny Boyle with McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Ewen Bremner.

"While everyone was listening, he was flirting!  Kanye West threw a party and invited everybody who was somebody to listen to his new “Ye” album in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last week. And despite wifey Kim Kardashian being in attendance, Kanye’s attention was on a different woman, RadarOnline.com is exclusively reporting.  Insider claim Kanye, 40, has a thing for Trump supporter and conservative activist Candace Owens. The “New Slaves” rapper boldly professed how much he loves the way she thinks in a Twitter post on Apr. 21 and at his listening party, which he invited her to, his actions showed he loved much more her intelligence.  I love the way Candace Owens thinks — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 21, 2018  “They were touchy feeling and it looked like they’re more than friends,” an onlooker told Radar of their interaction. “‘Ye was showing Candace off to everybody, introducing her as his best friend.  “He complemented her on her beauty and brains, telling people she could be our first female president,” the source claimed. “They were flirting, laughing and smiling in each other’s face. They had crazy chemistry.”  The source indicated that Kim, 37, was oblivious to her husband swooning over Candace and thinks the reality television star should pay closer attention.  PHOTOS: In The Dark! Kim Shields Kids From Kanye West’s Crisis  “When ‘Ye wasn’t with her, he was with Candace,” the source added. “If Kim knew what’s best, she’d keep Kanye away from Candace.”  As Radar previously reported exclusively, there’s some serious tension between the A-List couple. Kanye’s erratic behavior as of late is driving Kim insane.  “Kim thinks that divorce may be her only option to save herself and her children right now,” another source told Radar. “She’s been having a breakdown herself over all of this, and has been crying to her mom and her sisters all week long!”  We pay for juicy info!

"A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea. The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears.Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.“It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds.Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.",0
"As recently as a month and a half ago, Kanye Westhad serious doubts about the future of his marriage to Kim Kardashian.  In a new interview with The New York Times, the rapper revealed that he had a ""real conversation"" about the possibility of a divorce over controversial remarks he made during an unfiltered appearance on TMZ Live. In May, West sparked widespread backlash when he said slavery was a choice, a statement he also told the NYT was taken out of context.  As Kanye recalled, ""There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, ‘Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?' So that was a real conversation.""",1
"Lena Dunham may be moving on from her ex-boyfriend Jack Antonoff with a new man.  The 31-year-old Girls creator was photographed with an unidentified companion in West Hollywood on Saturday night, wrapping her arm around him after they had sushi for dinner and headed to a nearby marijuana dispensary. In one shot, the mystery guy affectionately kisses Dunham on her head.  Lena Dunham and a mystery man MEGA  Her rep did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  PEOPLE confirmed in January that Dunham and Antonoff, 33, had split after dating for five years.  Dunham revealed in the March issue of Vogue that she underwent a total hysterectomy last year. She discussed the procedure and the outpouring of “overwhelming” and “heartening” support that she’s received from fans in an emotional Instagram post, aligning the experience to her breakup.  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign  up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  “I have a broken heart and I hear those don’t mend overnight,” she wrote. “But we are linked forever by this experience and our refusal to let it hold any of us back from even the grandest dreams.”  Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic  In her Vogue piece, Dunham chronicled the hysterectomy process from start to finish, explaining that she made the decision in the hopes of ending her crippling endometriosis-related pain. After “desperately” trying to manage a “new level of pain” from August to November, Dunham said she finally checked herself into the hospital and refused to leave “until they stop this pain or take my uterus.”  Dunham said the situation wasn’t easy on the former couple.  “My beautiful partner, who has seen me through so much pain with compassion and care, has to be away for work, and I can feel us growing slowly apart, since life is so determined to display its full complexity right now,” she wrote in Vogue. “I am surly and distant. I offer nothing.”  “He reminds me again and again that I am still a woman and still alive,” she continued. “But I also know that soon — for so many reasons that have nothing to do with my uterus — we’ll slip away from each other and I will face everything I am losing in impossibly tiny step.”  RELATED VIDEO: Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff Split After More Than Five Years Together  Dunham and Antonoff met in 2012 after being set up on a blind date by Antonoff’s sister Rachel and comedian Mike Birbiglia.  Days after PEOPLE confirmed Dunham and Antonoff’s split, she briefly addressed the breakup during a livestream on Instagram, saying she was still wearing a ring that Antonoff had given her.  “I’ll always wear it because love is a really cool, powerful, eternal thing,” she said. “It doesn’t have to be defined the way that we, in Western culture, define it as beginnings and ends.”  Antonoff has since been linked to Carlotta Kohl; the Bleachers frontman and model sat courtside at a Knicks game a couple weeks ago.",0
"Just because two people are in love and are great together doesn't mean the idea of marriage should continuously be forced upon them. For example, once again, Jennifer Lopez has said she's not marrying Alex Rodriguez — at this point in time. The marriage question is one the World of Dance judge is repeatedly asked. It's also an exhausting topic that Lopez should no longer have to discuss during every interview.  During Thursday's The Ellen DeGeneres Show, host Ellen DeGeneres brought up Lopez's relationship with Rodriguez and the possibility of the two saying ""I do."" DeGeneres began the conversation by telling J. Lo and referring to A-Rod, ""He said that y'all are gonna be getting married.""  The former Shades of Blue star quickly denied that statement by declaring, ""He did not say that. He did not say that.""  The two went back and forth a bit in a joking manner about Rodriguez's supposed declaration of marriage. But, that wasn't enough to stop DeGeneres from, once again, asking Lopez, ""So, you'll be getting married?""  The multifaceted Lopez answered, ""I don't know. I don't know."" DeGeneres pushed further by stating, ""You should, cuz y'all seem very happy."" The Second Act star agreed with the latter. ""We are,"" she said. ""We've been together a couple years, it's nice.""  TheEllenShow on YouTube  Of course, DeGeneres didn't stop there and said about them having a wedding, ""It would be good to do for Christmas.""  However, rather than giving a verbal response, Lopez reacted with the most telling facial expression. Here it is:  At this point of the marriage conversation, Lopez was still laughing and going along with DeGeneres, but it also seemed like she didn't know what else to say. It was almost like The Fosters executive producer was ready to move on to something else.  Was DeGeneres mainly teasing? Yes. Is she happy for the duo and wants them to live a beautiful life together? Of course. Does she really care or is trying to force them to get married? No. The interview was all in good fun and one Lopez took extremely well. That said, it has to get old reciting the same thing over and over again about your personal relationship.  Andrew Toth/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  In a Harper's Bazaar interview published on March 15, Lopez once again said about getting married, ""I do believe in marriage. And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now. It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well.""  Then, during a June 11 Good Morning America interview, Lopez said about marrying Rodriguez, ""We have to take our time. I've made plenty of mistakes in my past and ... we're mature now."" She continued,  ""We're grown ups and we're going to take our time and we're going to do things at our own pace. And our life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work we're truly blessed. We don't need anything more right now.""  How many more times does she need to say it? They are content with the current status of their relationship. The two certainly aren't in any rush to walk down the aisle. Even if someone's just joking around with Lopez and Rodriguez about marriage, having to repeatedly field those types of questions and to reaffirm their happiness is tiring. Let's all just let them enjoy their relationship without the pressure of marriage.",1

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Scott Stump  Bono has revealed he almost died during the making of U2's latest album, which explores the theme of mortality.  The 57-year-old lead singer reveals in the latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine that the undisclosed ordeal contributed to the subject matter of their latest album, ""Songs of Experience.""  Bono revealed that enduring a near-death experience contributed to the songwriting on U2's latest album, ""Songs of Experience."" Getty Images  ""This political apocalypse was going on in Europe and in America, and it found a perfect rhyme with what was going on in my own life,'' he said. ""And I have had a hail of blows over the years. You get warning signs, and then you realize that you are not a tank, as (my wife) Ali says. Edge has this thing that he says about me, that I look upon my body as an inconvenience.""  He did not want to discuss any details of the near-death experience.  ""It's just a thing that ... people have these extinction events in their lives; it could be psychological or it could be physical,'' he said. ""And, yes, it was physical for me, but I think I have spared myself all that soap opera.""  ""Especially with this kind of celebrity obsession with the minutiae of peoples' lives – I have got out of that,"" the singer explained. ""I want to speak about the issue in a way that lets people fill in the blanks of what they have been through, you know? It's one thing if you were talking about it in a place of record like Rolling Stone, but by the time it gets to your local tabloid it is just awful. It becomes the question that everyone is asking.""  It was the latest scare for Bono, who told Rolling Stone that doctors wanted to biopsy him for throat cancer in 2000 but thankfully everything ended up being fine. He also broke his arm in a bicycle crash in 2014 that he called a ""comic tragedy.""  ""But the thing that shook me was that I didn't remember it,'' he said about the accident. ""That was the amnesia; I have no idea how it happened. That left me a little uneasy, but the other stuff has just finally nailed me. It was like, 'Can you take a hint?'''  His undisclosed health issue meshed with themes he was already exploring on the latest album.  ""Well, strangely enough, mortality was going to be a subject anyway just because it is a subject not often covered,'' he said. ""And you can't write 'Songs of Experience' without writing about that. And I've had a couple of these shocks to the system, let's call them, in my life. Like my bike accident or my back injury. So it was always going to be the subject. I just didn't want to be such an expert in it.""  Follow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.",0

"We’re obsessed with all things beauty here at PeopleStyle. We review every new product, track cool new trends (have you seen this unicorn-inspired makeup?) and snoop inside celebrities’ medicine cabinets whenever possible. So we can freely admit that whenever we take a trip to Sephora or Ulta we inevitably leave with a few more products than we anticipated buying. If you’re guilty too, it’s actually not all that unusual.  According to a new video by Money (above), the average woman will spend $43 on a shopping trip for makeup. (Our bank accounts may not thank us, but our vanities sure do.)  What really gave us a shock, though, was discovering that a woman spends $15,000 on beauty products in her lifetime. That’s a lot of lipsticks… or the cash for a used car!  Out of that money, $3,770 is spent on mascara alone (shop our favorite here!). Another $2,750 is allotted to eyeshadows (blue is totally in right now). And $1,780 is dedicated to new lipsticks (these are the celebrity shades we’re loving right now). And that’s not even including all the products you need to buy to keep your beauty tools clean.  RELATED PHOTOS: Celebs’ Beauty Routines: The Products They Really Use  If all of these numbers seem shocking, it makes a lot more sense when you consider the entire beauty industry is worth an astounding $382 billion globally.

"Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.    'They’ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions… They don’t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there’s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It’ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection.

"$25 million later, Angelina Jolie has a new home in Los Angeles! Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she’s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate — check out pics of the lavish mansion here.  Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.  Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.  This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.  The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina’s new house? Do you think she’s prepping for a wedding?",1
"The video made it clear that Spears isn't herself when she's hungry.  Britney Spears and her boyfriend Sam Asghari posted a video on Wednesday night which gave fans a hilarious glimpse at what the singer is really like when she’s hungry. In the Instagram clip, Spears and Asghari start off walking hand in hand down a hallway. As they walk, you can hear Asghari complimenting Spears on her outfit. But then she interrupts him and asks where they’ll be eating. When he says “steakhouse,” she gets a goofy expression on her face and runs off, to which Asghari replies, “I think she’s really hungry.”  Spears confirmed that in the caption of her video.  “I was freaking hungry.” she wrote.  Britney Spears and Sam Asghari have often given fans behind the scenes peeks into their relationship via posts on Instagram. They’ve become known for their couples workout videos which show off their physical fitness and affection for each other. Britney also regularly shares heartwarming photos of them looking very much in love.  In the past, Asghari has said that he believes that they were brought together by fate. He was cast in her “Slumber Party” video in 2016 and he told Men’s Health that his inclusion in the taping was a last minute decision as they had already hired most of the other people who were in it.  “I got a call at midnight,” Asghari told Men’s Health in July.  “It went through so much to get to me. I don’t know if it’s some sort of a blessing or just meant to be.”  The Iranian-born model added that he tried to be funny with her after she introduced herself by pretending that he didn’t hear her name. It looks like the joke worked though because shortly after the video was released, the two were photographed together by paparazzi. Based on what Asghari said to Men’s Health, it looks like they started dating very soon after they met because, at one point, he reveals they never had any intention of being friends.  During the interview, Asghari raved about his popstar girlfriend, praising her for her humble nature and expressing gratitude for her presence in his life.  “She motivates me more than anyone,” Asghari continued.",0
"Like always, Coachella was the popular hangout spot for A-list celebs this weekend.  The star-studded grounds of Indio, California, were packed with famous musicians, models and actors listening to music and letting their guards down -- including Selena Gomez and The Weeknd.  REX/Shutterstock  Our fav couple was spotted cuddling on the festival grounds on Saturday, April 15, and they definitely weren't afraid to pack on the PDA.  I mean, look at them. The literally can't stop making out.  Take a breather, you two!  At this point, we aren't too surprised Selena Gomez and her famous bae DGAF about the cameras around them because they've already been spotted multiple times getting intimate in public places.  But, hey, they're still cute as hell and we still can't get enough of 'em. So let's look at more pics, shall we?  Over the weekend, Selena was wearing a springy, light blue dress covered in daisies while Abel rocked a blue plaid shirt. It was a shockingly low-key Coachella look for celebrities.  Either way, they looked adorable kissing in the crowd.  Oh, look! More kissing!  Look at these hotties.  My personal favorite picture of the couple from Coachella is a painfully adorable selfie Selena posted on Instagram yesterday.  In the photo, Abel has his arm wrapped around her as she peeks at the camera above her shades. She looks totally smitten.  C'MON, GUYS. QUIT BEING SO DAMN CUTE.  Well, it's safe to say these two had a romantic getaway in Coachella Valley, but it wasn't all kissing and relaxation for both of them.  On Saturday night, The Weeknd stepped away from Selena and hit the stage for a duet with Nav where he sang ""Party Monster,"" ""Starboy"" and ""Some Way.""  I wonder if they got separation anxiety from the few moments they weren't together.  While Selena and Abel were having the times of their lives at Coachella, Abel's ex Bella Hadid was nowhere in sight.  Instead of taking a trip to Cali, the model flew to Dubai for a weekend full of boat chillin' and skydiving with friends.  Maybe she was trying to avoid the massive PDA between Selena and her ex, or maybe she just isn't a festival-goer.  Either way, if I were her, I definitely wouldn't want to be stuck witnessing the blatant affection happening on Saturday.  But based off the fact both Selena and The Weeknd have made their love IG official, it's getting pretty impossible to ignore it.

It should come as no surprise that there's going to be a whole new cast of characters joining the characters you've already come to know, love, AND hate. Here's everything you need to know about the additions...  Chloe is Liberty High’s beautiful “it girl’ who’s also the new head cheerleader. The actress who's playing her, Anne Winters, has appeared in FX’s Tyrant and ABC’s Wicked City.  Getty Images  Chelsea is an artsy, witty type unafraid to speak her mind. Alden appeared on American Horror Story: Roanoke last year.  Mackenzie's brother, Cyrus is an edgy, cynical mischief-maker who champions the downtrodden. This is Cass’s first major role.  Courtesy of Advantage PR  Jackie is a warm, intelligent, passionate advocate for victims of bullying. Kelli is a Broadway star who won a Tony for The King and I in 2015. She's also appeared in CBS All Access’s The Good Fight.  Getty Images  Nina is a respected track star with a secret that's bound to cause trouble in season two. Samantha has appeared on MTV’s Teen Wolf and Freeform’s The Fosters among others.    Getty Images  Sonya is a smart and ambitious young litigator. Could she play a role in finally bringing Bryce to justice for raping Jessica? Allison starred in Syfy’s Incorporated and Fox’s Terra Nova.    Getty Images  Ben Lawson as Rick  Lawson plays Liberty High's beloved baseball coach, which means he was probably devastated when Jeff Atkins died in that car crash during season one.    Jake Weber and Brenda Strong as Barry and Nora  Barry and Nora are Bryce's parents. They were leaders in their community, but that could all change once Bryce begins facing the consequences of raping Jess in season one. The actors that play them, Jake and Brenda, are industry vets. Jake starred in NBC's Medium and Brenda played Mary Alice Young on Desperate Housewives.    Getty Images  Meredith Monroe as Carolyn  Carolyn is Alex's mother. She's a hardworking nurse, so could she have been working at the hospital when Alex came in with a gunshot wound? How will she react when she learns how Alex ended up with his injury? Was it self-inflicted or did Tyler shoot him (like some fans are theorizing)? Meredith won't have any trouble in her emotional scenes since she played Andie McPhee in the popular teen drama, Dawson's Creek.  Getty Images  R.J. Brown as Caleb  Caleb is Tony's boxing trainer. He's a fierce competitor inside the ring, but the funniest guy in the room outside of it. You might recognize R.J. Brown because he played Thomas White on The Carrie Diaries.

"The Big Bang Theory is going out on top. Despite recent remarks by CBS that it was in talks for more seasons of the highly-rated series, the network, producing studio Warner Bros. TV and executive producer Chuck Lorre just announced that the comedy will end its run in May 2019 with its upcoming 12th season. The Big Bang Theory still will rank as the longest-running multi-camera series in television history per WBTV, spanning 12 seasons and a record-breaking 279 episodes, .  “We are forever grateful to our fans for their support of The Big Bang Theory during the past twelve seasons. We, along with the cast, writers and crew, are extremely appreciative of the show’s success and aim to deliver a final season, and series finale, that will bring The Big Bang Theory to an epic creative close,” WBTV, CBS and Chuck Lorre Productions said in a joint statement.  CBS  The announcement about The Big Bang Theory coming to an end comes just two weeks after CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at TCA that “we don’t believe it’s the final season; we are in preliminary discussions to renew the show with the studio that produces it, Warner Bros.”  I hear conversations about a possible two-year renewal were going on as recently as late last week.  Eleven seasons in, The Big Bang Theory remains one of the biggest shows on television. Season 11 averaged 18.9 million viewers, even with Season 10. It was the second most watched series of last season, edging Sunday Night Football and only behind the now-canceled Roseanne. Among adults 18-49, Big Bang slipped a bit (4.4 in Live+7 vs. 4.9 last season) but still ranked as the second highest-rated entertainment program behind only NBC’s This Is Us.  According to sources, the decision to end the series was largely a creative one made by the producers. It was perceived that Season 12 would be the show’s last when CBS in 2017 renewed Big Bang for seasons 11 and 12 after WBTV had closed new two-year deals with the cast. But then few expected that Big Bang would remain as strong in the ratings as it’s been, maintaining its viewership and top standing in the rankings when most broadcasting series have been sliding.  To go beyond 12 seasons, Warner Bros. TV would’ve had to negotiate new contracts with the actors. The show’s original quintet are the highest-paid actors on TV with paychecks of around $1 million an episode.  REX/Shutterstock  There are no deals in place for next season between CBS and WBTV, between the studio and the cast as well as between the studio and the series’ creative staff. While this was not a business call as CBS and WBTV would’ve likely reached an agreement for more seasons, I hear that, with so many unknowns and not clear whether everyone wanted to come back, the producers had no desire to continue with the show creatively without the entire family on the show intact.  That and the lure of leaving on top, as the highest-rated comedy on television, having achieved the milestone of longest-running multi-camera sitcom, sealed the decision to end the series.  The final season of The Big Bang Theory will debut Monday, September 24 on CBS before moving to its regular time period on Thursday, September 27.  “The Big Bang Theory has been the defining comedy of its generation,” Kahl said today. “All of us at the Network take exceptional pride in this series that uniquely combines creative genius, commercial ratings success, cultural influence and characters who became so popular, they are easily known by just one name. We’re incredibly grateful for our partnership with Warner Bros., Chuck Lorre Productions and a brilliant cast and crew that has made such a ‘big bang’ and lasting legacy on the television landscape.”  The Big Bang Theory, which debuted in 2007 and airs in syndication around the world, has received 52 Emmy nominations and 10 wins to date (though has never won for Outstanding Comedy Series), and 7 Golden Globe nominations.  Since its off-network launch, Big Bang has been a syndication powerhouse and continues to deliver big ratings for TBS and the stations that carry it, with its success possibly marking an end of an era and may never be matched again.  The Big Bang Theory is executive produced by Chuck Lorre, Bill Prady, Steven Molaro and Steve Holland. The series stars Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar, Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch. The Big Bang Theory is produced by Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc., in association with Warner Bros. Television.  In 2015, the first-ever UCLA scholarship created by and named for a television series, The Big Bang Theory Scholarship supports undergraduate students in need of financial aid who are pursuing their higher education in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  And some fun facts: In addition to centering many of its episodes in the worlds of science and technology, The Big Bang Theory enjoys a healthy appreciation and support from the scientific community at large, including having a bee species (Euglossa bazinga), a jellyfish species (Bazinga Rieki) and a monkey at the Columbus Zoo (Dr. Sheldon Cooper) named in the show’s honor.",0
"Jesse Camp, best known as a VJ on MTV in the late 1990s, has been reported missing by his sister, Marisha Camp, after she stopped hearing from him over a week ago. Marisha posted on her Instagram Story that if anyone sees him, to ""please let him know that many, many people care.""  The Riverside Police Department told ET on Monday that Marisha ""filed a report with our department last week on the 19th stating he was missing,"" and through friends, she spoke with someone who claimed that her brother was last seen in Riverside, California, though it hasn't been confirmed that he was actually there. Police say that he was last seen in Fontana, California, on Thursday morning.  Marisha posted a number of videos of Jesse, whose real name is Josiah, and wrote, ""If anyone has seen or heard from my brother Jesse since Saturday, please, please, please reach out to me or ask him to call home!!!"" She said she's thankful to people ""who reached out to express their concern and support after my brother Jesse went MIA.""  According to police, Jesse's sister reported that she last spoke with her brother ""around the 11th or the 12th"" of July, which she said was ""unusual."" Police also told ET that Marisha said Jesse ""may have been depressed lately.""  ""Right now we do not see anything dealing with foul play,"" a police spokesperson added to ET. ""We don't have any suspicion or reason to believe that he's in any danger.""  The Riverside Police posted to their Facebook page and asked for information about Jesse, but also said that ""there does not appear to be anything suspicious at this time.""  A Fontana Police Department spokesperson explained to ET on Monday that an officer stopped Jesse outside a Sherwin Williams paint store in Fontana for a ""pedestrian check"" on July 19 at 10:20 a.m., before his sister filed the missing persons report. A bike patrol officer verified Jesse's ID and left after confirming that Jesse was OK, ET reports. It's not known why the officer conducted the check.  In May, Fontana Police booked and released the former MTV VJ for alleged possession of methamphetamine, but there was no additional information available.  Jesse won MTV's first ""Wanna Be a VJ"" in 1998. He became famous for his shaggy hair and irreverence. Later, he had a stint as a rocker with a 1998 album called ""Jesse & the 8th Street Kidz."" He has mostly been out of the spotlight in recent years, but appeared on a Funny Or Die program called ""Triumph's Election Special"" in 2016.",0
"Tobias Vincent Maguire (born June 27, 1975) is an American actor and film producer. He gained recognition for his role as Spider-Man in Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004), and Spider-Man 3 (2007). His other major films include Pleasantville (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999), Wonder Boys (2000), Seabiscuit (2003), The Good German (2006), Brothers (2009), and The Great Gatsby (2013).  He was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe Awards, and received two Saturn Awards, including one for Best Actor. He established his own production company in 2012 called Material Pictures, and co-produced Good People that same year. In 2014, he produced and starred as Bobby Fischer in Pawn Sacrifice.  Early life  Tobias Vincent Maguire was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of Wendy (née Brown), a secretary turned screenwriter and film producer and Vincent Maguire,[1] a construction worker and cook. He has four half-brothers.[2] He is of one eighth Austrian and one eighth Puerto Rican descent.[3] His parents, 18 and 20 years old, were unmarried at the time of his birth; the two married and subsequently divorced when Maguire was two.[4] Maguire spent much of his childhood moving from town to town, living with each parent and other family members.[5]  During his childhood, Maguire entertained the idea of becoming a chef and wanted to enroll in a home economics class as a sixth grader. His mother offered him $100 to take a drama class instead, and he agreed.[6] The transient nature of his school years began to take a toll on Maguire emotionally, and after another relocation for his freshman year, he dropped out of high school and did not return. Instead, he pursued an acting career.[7] By 2000, he had obtained his GED, noting that during his school days, ""I was not doing school; I was showing up, but... not really giving myself.""[8]  Career  Maguire's first appearance in a feature film was in 1989's The Wizard. He plays one of Lucas Barton's goons (one of three competitors at a video game competition) and had no lines. He worked as a child actor in the early 1990s, often playing roles much younger than his chronological age, and as late as 2002 he was still playing teenagers while in his mid-20s. He appeared in a variety of commercials and TV and movie roles, working opposite such actors as Chuck Norris (Walker, Texas Ranger), Roseanne Barr (Roseanne), and Tracey Ullman (Tracey Takes On...). Eventually, he was cast as the lead in the FOX TV series Great Scott!, which was cancelled five weeks later.[citation needed]  During many of his auditions, Maguire found himself auditioning for roles opposite another rising actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. The pair quickly became friends and made an informal pact to help each other get parts in their movies/TV shows/other projects. For example, both auditioned for the same part in the 1990 TV series based on the 1989 comedy Parenthood. DiCaprio was cast, and Maguire later got a guest role at least partly on DiCaprio's recommendation. The same scenario played itself out during casting for the 1993 movie This Boy's Life (featuring Robert De Niro as the lead); DiCaprio got the main teen role (coincidentally, the character was named ""Toby"") and Maguire got a part as one of Toby's friends.[9]  By the mid-1990s, he was working steadily but was also becoming involved in the hard-partying lifestyle of some of his fellow young actors. In 1995, he requested director Allan Moyle to release him from his part in the movie Empire Records. Moyle agreed, and all of Maguire's scenes were deleted from the final film.[10] Maguire then sought help for a drinking problem from Alcoholics Anonymous; he has been sober ever since.[11]  As part of his recovery from alcoholism and learning to deal with his self-described ""addictive and compulsive nature"",[11] Maguire changed his career path slightly to obtain roles where he and DiCaprio would not always be in competition for the same part, and the move paid off when given the role of Paul Hood, a teenage boarding school student whose narration anchors the action, in Ang Lee's 1997 film, The Ice Storm. This led to a variety of lead roles in films such as Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules, and Wonder Boys.[citation needed]  In the 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas he portrayed a hitchhiker who meets Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo during their drive to Las Vegas.[12]  In Ride with the Devil (1999), Maguire portrayed Jakob Roedel, opposite Jewel Kilcher. Here he played the son of a unionist German immigrant who joins his southern friends in the Missouri riders, avenging the atrocities committed against Missourians by Kansas Jayhawkers and redleggers.[13]  In 2001, Maguire took a role that featured his youthful-sounding voice, a beagle puppy named Lou, in the family movie Cats & Dogs.[14]  In 2002, Maguire starred in Spider-Man, based on the popular Marvel Comics superhero. The film was a major success and made him into a star. He reprised the role in the sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and has also provided the voice of Spider-Man for the video game adaptations of the films. All three movies went on to be part of the highest-grossing movies each year.[15][16][17]  His performance as Spider-Man earned him some glowing reviews. Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune wrote that ""with his big, round, soulful eyes, Maguire always has been able to convey a sense of wonder, and his instinct for understatement also serves him well here.""[18] Due to script and production complications, a proposed fourth Spider-Man movie did not materialize. Sony decided to reboot the franchise.[19] The film, titled The Amazing Spider-Man, was released on July 3, 2012, with a different actor, Andrew Garfield playing the lead.  Maguire had a lead role as the jockey John M. ""Red"" Pollard in Seabiscuit, about the famous racehorse Seabiscuit.[20] In 2006, he starred in his first villainous role as Corporal Patrick Tully opposite George Clooney and Cate Blanchett in Steven Soderbergh's The Good German, based on the Joseph Kanon novel of the same name.[21] He is also a producer whose production credits include 25th Hour (2002), Whatever We Do (2003), and Seabiscuit (2003), for which he served as executive producer.[22]  In 2008, he made a cameo appearance in the action comedy film Tropic Thunder as a gay 18th century[23] monk with his eye on Father O'Malley (Kirk Lazarus, the character played by Robert Downey, Jr. in Tropic Thunder) in the faux trailer for Satan's Alley. He was a last-minute replacement in the role, and due to previously-scheduled commitments was only available to be on set for two hours to film his scenes.[24] Near the end of Tropic Thunder, it is revealed that Maguire's character has been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for Satan's Alley, which he loses to Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) for his role in Tropic Blunder, presented by Kirk Lazarus.[citation needed]  In 2009, he starred alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman in the Jim Sheridan-directed war drama Brothers as Sam Cahill, a prisoner of war who returns from Afghanistan and starts believing that his wife has become romantically involved with his brother. He received critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the film. Of the nomination, Maguire said, ""I had no expectation about getting a nomination, but I was watching nonetheless. My wife and my son got really excited. I was sort of surprised – I was like, 'Oh, wow.' And I couldn't hear the latter part of my name."" [25] Maguire lost to Jeff Bridges for his role in Crazy Heart.  Maguire and DiCaprio once again performed together, in Baz Luhrmann's remake of The Great Gatsby (2013); DiCaprio played the title role, while Maguire played the story's narrator, Nick Carraway.[26][27]  In 2012 Maguire was co-producer of Good People. That same year he also established his own production company, Material Pictures, which secured independent financing in 2013 to help it produce more feature films.[28]  His next film, Pawn Sacrifice (2015), was also co-produced by Material Pictures. It was a Cold War thriller based on the true story of American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer, played by Maguire. The film details the events leading up to and including the world chess championship in 1972, when Fischer challenges Soviet chess grandmaster and world champion, Boris Spassky, acted by Liev Schreiber.[29] It received mostly positive reviews.[30]  Maguire reunited with Alec Baldwin in the animated movie The Boss Baby, where he voiced as the adult version of Tim Templeton.  Personal life  Maguire has been a vegetarian since 1992; in 2009, he became a vegan.[31][32][33] PETA declared him the World's Sexiest Vegetarian in 2002.[34] He has made changes in his diet to either gain or lose weight for movie roles: he dramatically decreased his calorie intake for Seabiscuit, followed by a rapid increase to regain weight for Spider-Man 2.[35] Maguire has been sober since the age of 19 after experiencing ""some difficulty"" with alcohol in his late teens.[36]  Maguire met jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer in 2003 while he was shooting the movie Seabiscuit at Universal Studios, and they became engaged in April 2006. Their daughter was born in November 2006.[37][38] Maguire and Meyer married on September 3, 2007, in Kona, Hawaii.[39] Their second child, a son, was born in May 2009.[40] On October 18, 2016, the couple announced their separation after nine years of marriage.[41] In 2017, they were officially divorced.  In 2004, Maguire took up tournament poker. He has finished in the money in several events and has been tutored by poker professional Daniel Negreanu. Maguire can be seen on ESPN's coverage of the 2005, 2006, and 2007 World Series of Poker Main Event Championship.[42][43] He was one of many celebrities, along with Ben Affleck and Leonardo DiCaprio who participated in Molly Bloom's high-stake poker games at The Viper Room in the mid-2000s,[44] and received bad press for reportedly demanding Bloom ""bark like a seal"" for a $1,000 poker chip after a tournament he almost lost.[45] Shortly after this episode Maguire reportedly stole the game from Bloom, leading Bloom to move to New York.[46] Maguire's actions at the game are portrayed by Michael Cera in the film Molly's Game through the character ""Player X,"" an amalgamation of multiple celebrity poker players but especially Maguire.[47]  Filmography  Accolades",0

"Are Jax Taylor’s days on Vanderpump Rules numbered following his shocking meltdown on the latest episode of the show?  On Monday night’s episode, Jax, 38, blew a fuse while working at SUR and started cursing and yelling at everyone, including his boss Lisa Vanderpump.  “F–k you all,” yelled Jax in front of Lisa and customers at SUR. “F–k you all, you f–king lying sacks of s–t. F–k you all.”  Lisa tried to calm him down and get him to leave but Jax was having none of it. As for what set him off, it had to do with a number of issues with his costars. He was upset with Scheana Marie for trying to hook up his girlfriend Brittany Cartwright with Adam, another SUR bartender.  Jax was also angry that he was being accused of making up the rumor about James Kennedy and Kristen Doute hooking up in Mexico.  Understandably, Lisa was highly upset with Jax’s behavior.  “Of hundreds of employees, I’ve never had anybody speak to me the way you speak to me,” said Lisa to Jax after he refused to leave, choosing instead to flip off the entire restaurant. “You’re arrogant and you’re obnoxious. You’re acting like a little f–king baby.”  The episode ended with Jax ultimately walking out of the restaurant after being asked repeatedly by Lisa to leave.  So what does this all mean? Did Jax get fired from SUR? Is he leaving Vanderpump Rules? Well, according to Jax, fans have nothing to worry about.  Right after the episode aired, Jax tweeted: “Oh I ain’t going anywhere buddy,” after a fan tweeted to him that he had gotten the boot. That tweet is below.  oh I ain’t going anywhere buddy. https://t.co/qUkF9yXvAf — Jax (@mrjaxtaylor) April 10, 2018  And when it comes to the James and Kristen drama, Jax insists he did not invent the rumor.

"There have been times in the past when we've questioned the behavior of Kevin Bacon, a Philadelphia-born actor and musician whose father shaped our city and therefore matters more to us than other celebrities.  Like, why did he wear spandex for an Apple commercial that aired exclusively in Europe? It was funny. That's a good enough reason. Also, ever since his grave misfortune at the hands of Bernie Madoff, Bacon has been vocal about the need for creatives to take a more structured approach to managing their finances. Perhaps the money was worth the spandex.  The latest Bacon question: Is he really singing the praises of President Donald Trump?  In the depressing age of fake news, there is a dual responsibility to identify the difference between news that is actually false or fabricated and news that simply rubs us the wrong way, generally because it comes with a slant or there are omissions that would otherwise provide a more comprehensive picture.  We can decidedly say that a recent story claiming Kevin Bacon believes we are all ""blessed"" to have Donald Trump as our president is utterly untrue.  The dubious news blog Worldwide Politics published a story on Sunday recapping a supposed interview Kevin Bacon had on ABC's ""This Week With George Stephanopoulos."" During this interview, the actor reportedly gushed over President Trump.  “I honestly think that we are blessed to have him as President – he is the only one who can take care of all this mess,"" Bacon supposedly said. “He should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.”  Bacon, of course, campaigned for John Edwards in 2007 and later donated to Barack Obama in 2008, officially endorsing the former president during his successful re-election bid in 2012. That's not to say some Obama voters didn't shift their support to Trump in 2016, but little about Bacon's political past suggests he would have done so himself.  Here's the kicker: Kevin Bacon last appeared on ""This Week"" in 2007 and never spoke a word about Donald Trump.  Worldwide Politics is the epitome of a fake news website. It's also not the only one that traffics in falsified celebrity news. Late last month, the Daily News for Americans ran a made-up story claiming actress Julia Roberts — an attendee of the Women's March in Washington, D.C. — called Trump ""the best president in US history.""  The only place this Kevin Bacon story may have legs, in other words, is in a game of ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.""",1

"She was awarded the top prize of the evening, picking up the Woman Of The Year trophy at the ELLE Style Awards on Monday night.

Emma Watson appeared uninterested in receiving the top honour at the Elle Style Awards on Monday - and even kept organisers waiting for 90 minutes for her arrival  A source tells MailOnline: 'Emma clearly wasn't interested in the event.

"As the couple deny fresh cheating and divorce rumours we take a look back at David's alleged affair with Rebecca Loos.  The world's most famous soccer player marries a superstar pop singer, what could possibly go wrong? Almost ever since David and Victoria Beckham's 1999 nuptials, their relationship has been plagued by tales of alleged affairs, most famously the purported affair between David and his former-assistant, Rebecca Loos. And it seems a new-wave of cheating accusations could hit the Beckhams, as Twitter this weekend was set alight with rumours of infidelity and an impending Beckham divorce. Victoria, 44, and David, 43, have since released a statement denying the new rumours, and branding them ""fake news"". If you're experiencing déjà vu, it's because David and Victoria have penned similar statements defending their relationship in 2003, when Rebecca Loos famously claimed she had an affair with the soccer champion.  David and Victoria show a united front in the face of fresh cheating rumours.  David's alleged affair with assistant Rebecca Loos  In 2003, David was in the prime of his football career. The England Captain had been sold by his home club Manchester United to Spain's Real Madrid, for a whopping price. And while his star had never been brighter, a shock was soon to hit the Beckham family. In September of that year, David was spotted with a woman at a nightclub in Madrid. The woman was later identified as his assistant Rebecca Loos. Subsequently, the rumour mill kick-started into overdrive, churning out tales that the Beckham marriage was in trouble, which David denied. The now-defunct News Of The World, published a story from ""a source"" outlining several sexual encounters David and Loos allegedly had after that night at the club. They also reported the two exchanged racy texts. The story claimed Victoria contacted the assistant, warning her to stay away.  Rebecca Loos reportedly had an affair with David Beckham while the pair were working together in Spain.  Rebecca Loos' brother's statement  Loos brother then surprised British tabloids by claiming his sister had confirmed to him that she'd had an affair with David in Spain. ""Rebecca phoned home early this morning. I am overwhelmed with shock,"" Loos' brother John Charles told the Daily Mail in April 2004. ""Rebecca was upset when she parted company with David and Victoria last year. She became very down and cried a lot. At times she looked heartbroken. I thought it was because of professional reasons. But now I am beginning to understand there must have been more to it.""  Rebecca Loos, Victoria Beckham and her son Romeo watch David play for Real Madrid back in 2003.  While explosive allegations of David's infidelity flew, Victoria reportedly packed up their two children and flew to Switzerland, where David was to meet them from Madrid. Spokespeople for the family said the trip was a long-planned getaway and not a plan to escape media attention.  David's statement on alleged affair  In response to Loos' brother's comments, David released a statement. ""During the past few months I have become accustomed to reading more and more ludicrous stories about my private life,"" it read. ""What appeared this morning is just one further example. The simple truth is that I am very happily married. I have a wonderful wife and two very special kids. There is nothing any third party can do to change these facts.""  Rebecca Loos' tell-all  Rebecca gave an explosive tell-all interview with SKY TV alleging her professional relationship turned romantic with David as he grew lonely in Madrid. ""I think the chemistry between David and I was so strong and people were not happy because I was being very unprofessional and he's a married man,"" she said at the time. ""He is very generous lover. He gives a lot. He pleases. He knows what you want. It's all about you and not so much about him. It's nice."" When asked about the Beckham's intention to involved layers, Loos replied, ""What are they consulting their lawyers for? What can they do? I think they have worked very hard at getting the image they have and I think they will do everything they can to maintain it."" ""So whether that involves having happy shots taken or calling their lawyers it's up to them. I am 100 percent sure of what I am talking about, there no doubt in my mind I have no reason to lie -- why should I? I am just here to tell you my experience. He knows the truth and I know the truth."" Again, Victoria and David vehemently denied Loos' story calling it ""absurd and unsubstantiated"". Victoria and her two sons, Brooklyn and Romeo relocated to Spain so the family could be together with David.  The couple have weathered allegations of affairs time and time again.  The Beckham's sue  Following the months and months of stories of alleged infidelities, the soccer player and his wife turned to their lawyers, seeking justice. In 2004, they filed a lawsuit against News of the World, after a story was published claiming David also had an affair with a beautician named Danielle Heath. The couple then amended the complaint in 2005 to include another story by the publisher which detailed quotes from the couple's former-nanny Abbie Gibson, that the Beckham marriage was a lie. They also sued the nanny for breach of confidence. ""We are sick and tired of people trying to make money at the expense of our family,"" the Beckhams said in a statement.  The ultimate power-couple.  Where is Rebecca Loos now?  Fourteen years after her alleged affair with David Beckham, Rebecca Loos has completely turned her life around. After being dismissed from her position at Real Madrid, Loos went on to star on a range of reality TV shows. The Spanish-born beauty eventually fell in love with medical adviser Sven Christjar Skaiaa, who worked on one of the shows she appeared on.",0
"It's official - Jane Fonda has confirmed plans for herself, Dolly Parton and Lily Tomlin to return for a sequel to their movie, 9 to 5!  Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda are ready to punch the clock once again as a sequel to their 1980 comedy 9 to 5 is in the works. According to Entertainment Weekly, Fonda revealed plans for the trio to team up for a modern revival.  “My role is as an executive producer, and I’m working with the writers, with Lily, and talking to the writers,” Fonda told reporters at the Television Critics Association panel. “Right now, Dolly, Lily and I are all intending to be in it.”  The film, said Fonda, will tackle current issues in the workplace like changing technology and corporate voyeurism.  “I’m sorry to say the situation is worse today,” she said. “Today a lot of the workforce is hired by an outside company. Who do you talk to if you have a problem?”  Rumors of a remake swirled earlier this year when it was revealed that Rashida Jones and the original screenwriter, Patricia Resnick, teamed up to co-write a script. At the time, Parton was eager to reprise her role for a follow-up film.  “All these years we’ve talked about doing a sequel to 9 to 5 and it never made any real sense until just recently,” Parton said to Entertainment Weekly previously. “We decided that we are going to do another one. We are trying to get the script and all that, everyone is very interested and we’ve all agreed that we’d love to do it if it’s right.”  Added Parton, “I told them we better get after it or it’s going to be 95 instead of 9 to 5.”  No word on when production for 9 to 5 will begin for Parton, but in the meantime, the Tennessee native has her hands full with several major projects. In addition to acting, Parton’s production company, Dixie Pixie Productions, has teamed up with Warner Bros. Television and Netflix to create eight original films based on her music. The films are set to air on Netflix in 2019.",0
"CLOSE Kurt Russell and Chris Pratt talk about playing an estranged father and son in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' and bonding in real life. USA TODAY  Kurt Russell, 66, and Chris Pratt, 37, star as father and son in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)  Correction & clarifications: An earlier version of this report misidentified the location of Pinewood Studios. It is south of Atlanta.  FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. — Chris Pratt has the most awesome space dad ever.  On this sunny afternoon at Pinewood Studios just south of Atlanta, Kurt Russell is holding court on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (in theaters Thursday night), telling stories over a campfire. Not tales from Big Trouble in Little China or Escape From New York, though — Russell is in cosmic character as Ego, a living planet who’s just met his long-lost son, Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord (Pratt).  Yes, you read that right: Russell plays an all-powerful living planet and that's not even the craziest aspect of the Guardians’ corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A talking raccoon, a sentient alien tree with a three-word vocabulary (""I am Groot"") and the rest of this misfit accidental family took the world by storm with the 2014 runaway summer hitGuardians of the Galaxy. The sequel — which is on track to open with $150 million domestically — doubles down on the eye-popping new worlds, over-the-top personalities and family drama.  CLOSE Baby Groot steals the show in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' USA TODAY NETWORK  ""Guardians has gone from being an untested, little-known risky Marvel side project with an unusual cast and offbeat sensibility, to a premier brand worthy of its ascension to the coveted opening summer weekend slot,"" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore.  The biggest asset at the heart of this sci-fi space opera? A crew of “damaged souls who are looking for some form of love or redemption and haven’t really ever experienced either of those things,” says returning writer/director James Gunn.  Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper, left) and Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) are friends till the end. (Photo: Marvel)  “The reason why so many people love this movie and feel so connected to these characters is because they’re utterly outcasts and oddballs and strange,"" Gunn says. ""They're not the Avengers, they're not the pitch-perfect group of guys who have everything going on. They’re losers often, and even though they have some extraordinary abilities, they’re no better or worse than we are.”  The Guardians — the rogueish Star-Lord, assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), overly literal warrior Drax (Dave Bautista), sarcastic yet damaged Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and adorably precocious Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) — have already saved the universe, though Peter is still in search of his real father after having been raised from childhood by space outlaw Yondu (Michael Rooker).  The sequel has them on the run from the conceited aliens known as the Sovereign, and after having saved the heroes from certain doom, Ego is enjoying a meal with his son on the forest planet Berhart, though Peter is curious why Dad never came back for him when his mother died and instead hired Yondu to pick him up.  Ego (Kurt Russell, center) reconnects with his son Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) over a campfire meal while Gamora (Zoe Saldana) looks on with distrust. (Photo: Marvel)  “I would have done so myself, but I was in the midst of an outlandish adventure battling demonic forces to save this dimension or some such nonsense. I don’t even recall. It all bleeds together after a while,” Ego explains. He wonders aloud why Yondu kept Peter instead of returning him, leaving Ego searching for his boy ever since.  “Because I was a skinny kid who would squeeze into places adults couldn’t and it made thieving easier,” says Quill, clad in a shirt sporting an alien candy logo.  Yet there’s as much humor as serious stuff in a Guardians film, and Drax is the first to break the tension. “I thought Yondu was your father,” he says, leading everyone to look at the muscular warrior like he’s nuts.  “Wait. After all this time hanging out together, you thought Yondu was my blood relative?” Quill says in exasperation, leading Drax to deadpan, “You look exactly alike.”  Yondu (Michael Rooker, center) is ousted from his role as leader of the Ravagers. (Photo: Marvel)  Rocket chimes in “One’s blue!” — though Cooper hasn't yet added the furry guy’s vocals. Gunn’s brother Sean (who also returns as Yondu’s Ravager buddy Kraglin) does Rocket’s motion-capture performance and line reading with co-stars.  James Gunn has put together a close-knit clan of friends and actual family on his Guardians films, and it’s reflected in the sequel’s story of ""fathers, sons, stepfathers, sons who have never seen their father, fathers who have lost their son,” Russell says. “And when they finally get back together, everybody’s got to get used to each other. They’re not quite the way you had made them out to be in your imagination.”  Adds Gunn: “It’s a father/son story that could take place if your father’s a living planet in another galaxy or if your father’s a Wall Street broker.""  Director James Gunn (left) goes over a scene with Zoe Saldana and Chris Pratt on the Atlanta set of 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Marvel)  Pratt is effusive with praise for his legendary co-star Russell. “It’s a dream. I’ve been a huge fan of his for ages. There’s nothing disappointing about working with him,” says the actor, who enjoyed Russell’s frequent stories from his heroic roles in such movies as Tombstone and Tango & Cash.  So how does an icon like Russell play a planet? He leans into the machismo and quirks of those old parts. “There’s a lot of baggage that’s right for this in terms of the kinds of things I can bring as an actor to the table,” he says. “And some of the things we created years ago have an element of connection to this character.”  Gamora is skeptical of Ego’s extreme interest in Peter, though she's also dealing with her adoptive sister and frenemy Nebula (Karen Gillan), a villain from the first film whom the Guardians have taken captive. Nebula is looking extremely irked while handcuffed as everybody else is gobbling Ego’s blue space chow. (It’s not very good, Russell reports. “It’s prop Jell-O. We never ask questions, we just eat it.”)  Nebula (Karen Gillan) returns with a bone to pick with her sister in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Chuck Zlotnick)  But everybody needs and seeks a sense of belonging, even Nebula. “She’s been raised to be a killing machine and not have any empathy or emotion,” Gillan says. “However, she has these natural feelings toward her sister that she’s trying to suppress but can’t.”  Saldana is just glad to have more women around — not just Gillan but also new cast member Pom Klementieff, who plays the Guardians’ insect-like telepathic ally Mantis. “The older I get, the more I realize that it’s pretty lonely being the only female in the cast,” Saldana says. “You’re going to be surrounded by a whole bunch of dudes talking about their (manhood) and bodybuilding and eating healthy.”  She loves her dudes, though, and there’s a connection between the stars of that original Guardians. Saldana is proud of how Pratt lost weight and got fit for the first movie while “still remaining this super-humble and sweet and charming individual,” and she’s continually wowed by Bautista’s gentleness and subtlety.  Drax (Dave Bautista, left) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) launch into a new mission to save the universe in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Marvel)  “He doesn’t believe that he’s funny,” Saldana says. “I hope that day doesn’t come where Dave goes, ‘You know what, you’re (messing) up my take here.’ ”  More than anyone, the success of the original Guardians has been career-making for Bautista, a former pro wrestler who parlayed Drax into a high-profile role as the villainous Mr. Hinx in the 2015 James Bond movie Spectre.  His Marvel character looks like “a powerhouse who’ll rip your head off and then he says something completely ridiculous,” says Bautista, though as emotionally scarred as he is, “there's definitely a sense of innocence about him.” Drax also has a body full of tattoos, and Bautista had a sauna outside of his trailer to soak off all the makeup and prosthetics daily. “You’d think I’m like a diva with a sauna. But no.”  Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) enjoy a laugh in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Marvel)  Drax meets his quirky match in Klementieff’s Mantis, and the French actress is impressed that Gunn is so good at casting. “Everybody he chose has a big heart and I think it shows on screen.”  The director wears his fandom on his sleeve, with pop-culture references aplenty and scads of Easter eggs and cameos born from a lifetime of reading comic books. ""Anybody can delve into comic history and pull out obscure characters,” says Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige. “Not everybody can turn them into emotionally resonant and relatable characters that audiences can fall in love with.”  Gunn says the emotion he feels for his family and friends is “a bigger inspiration than even the comic-book characters.” He dedicated the movie to his parents in the audience at Vol. 2’s Hollywood premiere, and Gunn looks out for those closest to him.  Sean Gunn plays Kraglin the Ravager in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' and also provides the motion-capture performance for Rocket Raccoon. (Photo: Chuck Zlotnick)  The filmmaker went to bat for his close friend Rooker when it came to casting Yondu. “I don’t think I was Marvel’s first choice. I’m sure there are many other stars and actors that would have brought in more money,” Rooker says. “I wasn’t in the room when he was convincing them, but I would bet you my right arm that he had my back in a big way.”  And Sean Gunn embraces his status as “the utility infielder of the Guardians cast” with pride. Watching his older brother’s rise has been “probably more fun and gratifying for me than just about anyone. I feel like I’ve had a front-row seat to his success.”  Taserface (Chris Sullivan, right) and the Ravagers take Rocket and Groot prisoner in the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' sequel. (Photo: Marvel)  James Gunn has already started writing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to complete his trilogy, discussing the story with Pratt and having “some pretty intense conversations” with Saldana about a significant role in the threequel. The only travels Gunn has on his docket in the near future, though, are relaxing ones to “get my head on straight after three years of waking up and going to sleep and thinking about a talking raccoon.”  In the Marvel galaxy, there’s room for more than one awesome space dad.  “I love these characters,” Gunn says. “Including my father and my dog, my mother had eight kids, and I have all these Guardians. They’re my kids.”  Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2pnJz4G",0

THEY DONT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE!!”  The Ritz-Carlton’s official Twitter account expressed their dismay at Jones’ tweet, replying with the following response:  This isn’t the first time that the Ritz-Carlton has been accused of discrimination. In 2015, the North Carolina Attorney General’s office investigated the luxury hotel chain’s Charlotte location for potentially discriminating against Black people by adding a 15 percent surcharge to customers bills during a CIAA conference.  This also isn’t the first time the Saturday Night Live star has publicly expressed her concerns. Last summer, Jones also took to Twitter to express that no designer would dress her for the premiere of Ghostbusters, which the comedian starred in.",0

"Singer FERGIE has separated from her actor husband Josh Duhamel after eight years of marriage.  The stars announced the sad news on Thursday, revealing they called it quits months ago.  “With absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,” the estranged couple wrote in a statement issued to People.com. “To give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public. We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.”  Fergie and Josh share four-year-old son Axl.  The stars tied the knot back in 2009 in a Catholic ceremony after becoming engaged in 2007. They first met on the set of Josh’s TV show Las Vegas in 2004, when Fergie’s band the Black Eyed Peas made a cameo on the series.  The news is likely to come as a shock to fans of the pair – Transformers star Josh frequently gushed about his marriage to Fergie, including in a Haute Living magazine interview in May.  “We genuinely like each other,” the 44-year-old told the publication when quizzed on the secret to his happy union with the M.I.L.F. $ hitmaker.  “(We) have a lot of love for our son and have a good time together,” he added. “And that’s about it.”  Just a month later, in June, Josh praised Fergie’s parenting skills during an interview on America’s The Ellen DeGeneres Show.  “Having a kid at 40 years old is much different than having one at 22, you know, so I’m a little more mature than I was then,” he smiled. “I’m just doing the best that I can, trying not to screw him up for life. You never know. (But Fergie) is definitely more evolved than I am, and more patient.”",0

But many people of the Internet didn't think his words were so funny and the entertainer faced some serious online backlash for his remarks.  The Brit took to Twitter on Sunday to apologize, writing, ""To be clear, sexual assault is no laughing matter. I was not trying to make light of Harvey’s inexcusable behavior, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims. I am truly sorry for anyone offended, that was never my intention.""",0

"It has been two-and-a-half years since Miranda Lambert divorced Blake Shelton, but there still seems to be some bad blood between the former couple. New reports claims that they still get under each other’s skin, and Lambert “can’t stand” her ex’s high-profile romance with Gwen Stefani. So, how will she react if Blake Shelton proposes to Gwen Stefani on Valentine’s Day?  That there is still animosity between the former couple and it is all because Shelton parades his relationship with Stefani around for the world to see. An insider claims that seeing Shelton happy with his hot girlfriend “burns” Lambert.  “I do this thing called whatever I want” pic.twitter.com/C3TawRy5FW — Miranda Lambert (@mirandalambert) February 7, 2018  The insider went on to say that Shelton and Lambert have traded scathing messages, and she has accused him of using Stefani to make her jealous. But, Shelton allegedly responds that Stefani has everything that Lambert doesn’t.  It seems the former couple may be still throwing jabs at each other even though they have both moved on to happy relationships.  Shelton and Stefani have been together since late 2015, and Lambert has been with Anderson East for about the same amount of time.  Lambert did take a shot at her ex during a recent concert on her Livin’ Like Hippies tour. During her song Little Red Wagon, she changed the lyric “I live in Oklahoma” (which is where Shelton is from and where they lived while they were married) to “I got the hell out of Oklahoma.”  Shelton quickly hit back.

Stefani even shared several photos and videos of the day on her Instagram account.  Rumors have also surfaced that one of Shelton’s assistants has been shopping for a diamond ring in Beverly Hills. Some believe the I’ll Name the Dogs singer is preparing to propose to Stefani on Valentine’s Day.  The high-end broker deals expensive, multi-carat, rare diamonds in simple settings, and it is not unheard of for customers to drop half a million dollars on a piece of jewelry in the store.  Could Stefani and Shelton be headed down the altar? Fans will just have to wait and see. But, one thing is for sure, the couple has been quick to share their relationship on social media.  Advertisement  If Blake Shelton does pop the question to Stefani, they will surely let everyone know as soon as it happens, and there is no telling just how Miranda Lambert will react to the news.",1
"George Michael died young — but Hollywood bosses want as many as seven megastars of various ages to play the pop icon for a blockbuster biopic!  RadarOnline.com has learned Ryan Gosling, Oscar winners Mel Gibson, Michael Douglas and Benicio del Toro, along with British actors Tom Hiddleston, Tom Hardy and Michael Sheen are in the running to step into Michael’s shoes.  Eddie Redmayne and Keanu Reeves are also being considered, sources said.  PHOTOS: George Michael Spotted For The Last Time Before His Shocking Death  The “Careless Whisper” singer passed away at age 53 on Christmas Day 2016 under mysterious circumstances.  For his biopic, producers are said to be borrowing from 2007’s “I’m Not There” about music legend Bob Dylan. In that film, multiple stars, including Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett, portrayed various aspects of Dylan’s life.  “Producers are interested in doing the same with George Michael because he went through so much during his lifetime,” dished a snitch.  PHOTOS: Fans Pay Tribute To George Michael At Scene Of Bathroom Arrest  But the stages of the former Wham! star’s life are being referred to in “crude” terms, the source said.  “There have been talks that they need someone for the ‘closet years’ before George came out, the ‘toilet sex years’ when he was busted in a public restroom, the ‘addiction years’ and the ‘fat years’ when George was left bloated by his drinking, drug use and health problems,” the insider revealed.  “It’s a huge ask of one actor to portray all that, so splitting the job between several actors not only makes production easier, it also increases the chance of more people paying to see the film.”  We pay for juicy info!

"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s marriage is reportedly in trouble, but sources reveal exclusively to RadarOnline.com he can’t put up with her ridiculous diet demands any longer!  “Jen is banning all kinds of food from the house, and even though she’s barely spending any time in New York these days, she won’t let Justin have them at the apartment either,” says a source.  The actor is said to have “grown tired” of having to follow her “absurd rules all the time.”  PHOTOS: Jennifer Aniston’s Packed On ‘Nearly 50 pounds’ Amid Marriage Meltdown, Claims Source  “Right now, she won’t touch anything with soy or dairy in it and freaks out if she so much as sees them in the fridge.”  As fans know, Aniston, 48, has always been paranoid when it comes to staying in shape, and it’s not uncommon for her to go through these phases where she won’t eat certain things. But the insider reveals what’s causing problems is the fact that she insists Justin does the same.  “It’s just Jen’s latest way of controlling him,” claims the informant. “But this kind of behavior is not exactly going to help them get their relationship back on track.”  PHOTOS: Jennifer Aniston Continues To Show Off Bump After Denying Pregnancy  As Radar previously reported exclusively, according to a source, the duo’s two-year marriage was on the brink and erupted in a face-to-face showdown over the holidays after they had spent two and a half months apart. An insider claimed the incident sent the two hurtling toward a $225 million divorce.  The vicious bust-up at their Bel-Air mansion on Dec. 14 was “the fight to end all fights,” according to the informant — who saw a furious Justin storm out and head to a luxury hotel. “It was a stupid argument — the kind of disagreement most couples have. But this time things spiraled out of control, and Jen flipped out,” a source tattled to Radar.  We pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

"This marks the royal’s first official public appearance on his own since the wedding. We have learned that Prince Harry headed for a ‘private visit’ to Pitseng, Lesotho in South Africa without his new bride Meghan Markle.  Apparently, Harry is set to be in attendance at the opening of a brand new dining hall at the Phelisanong Children’s Centres on behalf of the charity he co-founded with close pal Prince Seeiso back in 2006.  One spokesperson for the charity Sentebale (‘forget me not’) released the following statement: ‘The Duke was on a private visit to view the work of Sentebale at a camp for helpless children and youngsters, as well as other projects funded by the same charity. During this private working visit to Sentebale, the Duke visited one of its community-led partners for the opening of a brand new dining hall. This was funded by the charity and is set to provide a space for kids to eat together and have indoor space to play.’  Meanwhile, on the charity’s official webpage it can be read that ‘Sentebale supports the mental health as well as the well-being of kids and young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana. Our programs of education and care provide the tools and knowledge that this vulnerable generation needs to live long, happy, healthy lives in the future.’  According to Kensington Palace, Harry will also be part of a board meeting of a conservation charity named Africa Parks, that he is an advocate for.

"Oprah surprised Tiffany Haddish on ‘The Ellen Show’ and like any sane person meeting Oprah, Tiffany sobbed uncontrollably when her idol stepped out. Watch the clip here!  If you think you’re Oprah‘s biggest fan, think again. Tiffany Haddish proved she loves the Wrinkle In Time star more than anyone else when she cried over her on the Feb. 22 episode of The Ellen Show. While telling a story to Ellen Degeneres about how she was an extra on an Oprah-produced film, the 38-year-old explained that the former talkshow host said to her, “Well, keep me updated on your career, write me, let me know what you got going on.” But the letters always went unanswered. “And so, I would write her, right? She never wrote back,” the Girls Trip star added. Then, Ellen yells out, “Oprah, why didn’t you write back,” and out comes Oprah! Cue a sea of Tiffany’s tears!  After the pair shared the warmest of hugs, they sat down and basically ignored the host of the show. Oprah turned to the comedian and said, “You are so so so good,” which Tiffany hilariously responded between sobs by saying, “Thank you! You told me that before in a dream!” The Keanu star couldn’t contain herself as her idol sang her praise, but when the media mogul explained that she lost her letter, Tiffany called her out with, “But I sent you like six!” We couldn’t love Tiffany anymore than we do after watching this video. Check it out above!  HollywoodLifers, would you also cry literal tears meeting Oprah like Tiffany did?",0

"Annabelle Neilson died suddenly from a stroke, the West London Coroner’s Court confirms to Us Weekly.  A spokesperson for the coroner tells Us, “The cause of death was cerebrovascular accident,” using the official medical term.  As previously reported, the Ladies of London star died on Thursday, July 12, at the age of 49. London’s Metropolitan Police Service told Us Weekly that the death was not being treated as suspicious.  Neilson worked as a model for years and was close friends with fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who died by suicide at age 40 in February 2015. She joined the Bravo reality series in 2014 but announced her exit the following year after two seasons. In more recent years, she worked as a children’s author, writing a series of books titled The Me Me Me’s, which were inspired by her struggles with dyslexia.  The reality star, who was raised in a wealthy British aristocratic family, had spoken candidly through the years about her past. She battled drug addiction and mental health issues after being assaulted at age 16 during a trip to Perth, Australia.  “I fell into a serious depression and became a heroin addict because it provided an escape bubble and was the only way I could cope,” she told the Daily Mail in December 2015. “In a way, heroin saved me, because otherwise I would have killed myself.”  Neilson was married to banker Nathaniel Rothschild from 1994 to 1997.  She is survived by her parents, Max and Elizabeth, and her sister, Millie.

"Sarah Rose Summers (born November 4, 1994) is an American model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss USA 2018. As Miss USA, she will represent the United States at Miss Universe 2018. Previously, Summers was crowned Miss Nebraska Teen USA 2012 and Miss Nebraska USA 2018, becoming the first woman from Nebraska to win Miss USA.  Life and career [ edit ]  Early life [ edit ]  Summers was born on November 4, 1994, in Omaha, Nebraska, and grew up in Papillion in the Omaha–Council Bluffs metropolitan area.[1][2] At four years old, she was hospitalized and diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).[3] She graduated from Papillion-La Vista South High School, and later earned two degrees cum laude from Texas Christian University in child development and strategic communication, with a minor in business.[4] Summers worked as a certified child life specialist prior to becoming Miss USA.[5][6][7]  Pageantry [ edit ]  Summers began her pageantry career at age ten, after she convinced her parents to allow her to compete in pageants when they received a postcard advertisement for a local child beauty pageant.[8][9] After four years of competing, Summers won the title of National American Miss Nebraska Junior Teen 2009. She went on to represent Nebraska at the national pageant and was crowned the 2009-2010 National American Miss Junior Teen.[10] In 2012, Summers was crowned Miss Nebraska Teen USA 2012. She went on to represent Nebraska at Miss Teen USA 2012 at Atlantis Paradise Island in Nassau, Bahamas, but was unplaced.[11] At the end of her reign, she crowned Jasmine Fuelberth as her successor.[12] After a hiatus, Summers returned to pageantry and competed in Miss Nebraska USA 2016, where she placed as the second runner-up.  In 2018, Summers was crowned Miss Nebraska USA 2018 by Fuelberth, who was the outgoing titleholder. At Miss Nebraska USA 2018, Summers represented Omaha.[13]  Miss USA 2018 [ edit ]  After winning Miss Nebraska USA, Summers earned the right to represent Nebraska at Miss USA 2018, held at Hirsch Memorial Coliseum in Shreveport, Louisiana.[14] She went on to win the competition, becoming the first woman from Nebraska and the eleventh former Miss Teen USA contestant to win Miss USA.[15][16][17][18][4] After winning Miss USA, she crowned Bree Coffey as her Miss Nebraska USA successor.  At the national competition, co-host Vanessa Lachey asked the following: ""You are on your way to a march where someone hands you a blank sign and a marker. What do you put on your sign and why?"":  ""...I say 'Speak your voice'. I don't know what march we're on our way to in this hypothetical situation, but no matter where you're going, whatever type of march it is, you're obviously on your way to that march because you care about that cause so go speak to people. When they have questions, communicate with them. Listen to their views also. That is one thing in the United States that we really need to focus on is listening to each other!...""  involve in racist Instagram video 2018 [ edit ]  Miss USA (Sarah Summers) has been involved a racist Instagram video.The contestant is shown gossiping backstage about a couple of their non-English-speaking competitors, Miss Vietnam (H’Hen Nie) and Miss Cambodia (Rern Sinat). It starts out with Miss USA asking the other girls what they think about Miss Vietnam, with Hung and Morales describing her as “cute”. But then Miss USA starts shading Nie’s English speaking skills:“She pretends to know so much English and then you ask her a question after having a whole conversation with her and she goes [nods and smiles]” laughs Summers. While Miss Australia also let out a laugh half way through Summers’ comment, she stays quiet, perhaps unsure what to say in response. Miss USA then switches focus to Miss Cambodia, talking about how “confusing” it must be to not speak English.“Miss Cambodia is here and doesn’t speak any English, and not a single other person speaks her language. Can you imagine?” Summers continues.“Francesca said that it would be so isolating, and I said, ‘Yes’. I mean just confusing all the time.”Summers then turns to Miss Colombia to say, “you at least speak pretty good English,” before Miss Australia adds, “And you have your Spanish.” The girls then all agree it would be “really hard” with Summers concluding, “poor Cambodia”.[19].  Miss USA has apologised for making comments about her fellow Miss Universe contestants' English language skills, admitting what she said could have been ""perceived as not respectful"" after people described the quotes as racist. [20].    As Miss USA 2018, Summers represented the United States at Miss Universe 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand, where she placed in the top twenty. The eventual winner was Catriona Gray of the Philippines.[21][22]",0

"The 2018 ESPYS celebrated not only the biggest achievements in sports on Wednesday night, but also the spirit and atmosphere of 2018 itself.  The sexual abuse survivors who spoke out against USA gymnastics and Michigan State coach Larry Nassar winning the Arthur Ashe Courage Awards created the most emotionally charged moment of the night. But there were many more tearjerkers throughout the three-hour show, including the heroes of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school shooting — Aaron Feis, Scott Beigel and Chris Hixon — being posthumously named Best Coach.  While millions of viewers watched the 2018 ESPYS live on ABC, TheWrap was inside the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles.  Also Read: Danica Patrick's ESPYs Monologue Called 'Awkward, 'Cringey' (Video)  Here’s what you didn’t see on TV.  Sexual abuse survivors make a lasting impact  The Arthur Ashe Courage Award is usually presented in the middle of the show but ESPN producers wisely moved it to the end of the night, knowing the importance of the 150 sexual abuse survivors taking to the stage together. The “sister survivors” of Nassar’s abuse over the past 30 years got the entire auditorium on their feet cheering them on. “The greatest tragedy of this is that it could have been avoided … all we needed was just one adult to stand between us and Larry Nassar,” Aly Raisman said in what would be the most impactful words of the night. All of the survivors stayed on the stage long after the end of the show, sharing their historic moment.  Cleveland fans aren’t laughing  “It’s true that the ESPYS have never had a host like me before,” Danica Patrick said to open the show as the first female host. Danica’s jab at Cleveland soon sparked a groan from much of the audience — we guess there are some Browns and Cavaliers fans in the house after all. At least Odell Beckham Jr. found her joke about his hair being “questionable” funny.  Few Fergie fans either …  The “real national anthem controversy” this year wasn’t about NFL players kneeling, Patrick said, as a picture of Fergie butchering the anthem at the NBA All-Star game appeared on the big screen. Oops.  Alex Ovechkin or Putin?  There weren’t many Trump supporters in the crowd, however. The night’s first political joke from Patrick – “I haven’t seen a Russian this pleased with Washington since … at least two days ago” – was tied to the Stanley Cup Finals but we all know who it was really about. And it sparked the first big cheer of the evening.

When Patrick said James was the biggest off- season acquisition the crowd went wild … but there was deadly silence when she made fun of his thinning hair.  OBJ’s calf flash  OBJ was co-presenter for Biggest Breakout Athlete but it was his legs that had the real breakout moment in a very dashing pair of designer shorts. (The actual recipient was Donovan Mitchell, who joins the realm of past winners like Tom Brady, LeBron James and Dak Prescott.) Antonio Brown later showed off his legs in shorts too, these ESPYS veterans clearly know how hot it gets on the red carpet.  Quiz time  The game played in the first commercial break to entertain attendees picked on random members of the audience. First up was none other than “Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman, who thankfully knew the name of the biggest NBA scorer in league history. Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson got thrown some movie trivia next but luckily he knew that Boseman starred in “Draft Day.”  Hug it out  The 27-strong US Women’s Hockey team took some time to gather on stage after they won for Best Game because “we’re a hugging team,” admitted one of the Olympic gold medal-winning players.  National karaoke champions?  The Notre Dame women’s basketball champions proved that they’re not only good at scoring, they’re also pretty good at karaoke. It was a little of a bumpy start when two of the players took to the stage to show off their singing skills, but like all the best teams, they had a miraculous comeback. In the next ad break however, the warmup host mistakenly said they were from Villanova.  LeBron dominates the red carpet without even being there  In case you’ve been living under a rock, LeBron James has signed with the LA Lakers. While the former NBA champion wasn’t actually at the ESPYS, that didn’t stop every athlete on the red carpet from being asked what they thought about him coming to Los Angeles.  King James was also on the mind of one audience member who called out his name when any category was announced. No. 23 for Best College Athlete? No, we don’t think so. Biggest Breakthrough? Not this year.  Also Read: Tom Brady, LeBron James Lead 2018 ESPYS Nominations  Top names miss TV spots  Though they’re arguably the best athletes in the world, Tom Brady, LeBron James and Roger Federer won categories that weren’t deemed important enough to be featured on TV — possibly because they weren’t able to attend the show — and their victories were announced during a TV time out.  Eagles fans at it again  Philadelphia Eagles fans are known for being crazy and outspoken (to politely put it), and one middle-aged fanatic in a tuxedo proved that by screaming “PHILADELPHIA” when QB Nick Foles won the Championship Award for his Super Bowl LII win … but it was his young son who looked really embarrassed by the outburst.  Jon Stewart fires up the audience  Jon Stewart complained about the audience’s lack of response when presenting the Pat Tillman Award for Service to Jake Wood. “One cheer for the Marines? Really?” which woke the crowd up to the impact of what former college football player Wood has done in countries like Haiti and for the relief effort in the wake of Hurricane Harvey with Team Rubicon, a non-profit where military veterans lead humanitarian missions to disaster areas.  “He’s also super tall and annoyingly handsome. Last night I saw him making his pregnant wife a hot coffee. I really don’t like this guy,” Stewart said bitterly.  The former “The Daily Show” host’s kick up the ass of the crowd — plus a very moving video of Team Rubicon’s work — earned Wood the first standing ovation of the night. And yes, he really did make Stewart look short.

"It’s official: Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham will soon graduate from fiancés to husband and wife.  Appearing on The View Wednesday, the happy couple made the announcement that their wedding will take place next year — in Hawaii!  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “We are very excited to tell you guys that we have booked a venue,” said Burnham. “We’re getting married in Hawaii on January 12th next year!”  “It’s in Maui — it’s at Haiku Mill which has this beautiful, old world feel with a lot of vines and greenery,” added Luyendyk Jr. “It’s not your typical beach wedding. And it’s a private wedding, so not on TV — just a close group of friends. Probably 100 guests.”  Asked whether they felt like they were rushing things, Burnham said if they could “get married tomorrow we would.”  “We’re just really happy with each other and we vibe well together,” she said. “We’re best friends, so we’re just ready for that next step.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  Luyendyk Jr., 36, and Burnham, 26, were at the epicenter of the most recent (and most controversial!) season of The Bachelor. Less than two months after proposing to finalist Becca Kufrin, Luyendyk Jr. realized he was still in love with his runner-up, Burnham. He ultimately decided to break things off with Kufrin, 28, to pursue a relationship with Burnham — and proposed to her on live television during the two-hour After the Final Rose special on March 6.  Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham on The Bachelor  Since then, all three parties involved have moved on. Kufrin is engaged once again, this time after wrapping production on The Bachelorette (her season premieres Monday on ABC), and Luyendyk Jr. and Burnham have moved in together in his hometown of Scottsdale, Arizona.  “We’re in our condo now and we just bought a new house,” Burnham said on The View. “Things are moving pretty quickly and everything’s been great.”  The couple also admitted that they have yet to watch their season finale — including the painfully raw footage of Luyendyk Jr. ending things with Kufrin.  “I think going back to that time, it was a big risk to do what I did and I know that it wasn’t a popular decision. But it was a decision I had to make for myself. … I knew that Lauren was the person I was supposed to be with,” said Luyendyk Jr. “I never watched the finale, so we don’t really know how that breakup looked on TV. But breakups are hard, and I think that everyone handles it in a different way. They say it was unedited, but it was edited. You’re not in control of the editing room and you can’t really control what they show.”  “My breakup was taped, everyone else’s was, and that’s just kind of the name of the game,” added Burnham.  And Luyendyk Jr. said he thinks his relationship with Burnham is even more solid because of what they went through.  “I think our relationship is stronger and I wouldn’t change it,” he said. “We’re happy. When we go out in public, it’s all positivity. And that’s cool to see.”  “Our relationship is so unique and it’s nothing that I’ve ever had before,” added Burnham. “So the fact that he was willing to take that risk and all of America hating him to be with me, that means a lot to me.”  Opening up exclusively to PEOPLE after the scandal, Luyendyk Jr. admitted he wholeheartedly regretted proposing to Kufrin while he was still in love with Burnham.  Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham Jana Cruder  “The simple fact is I made a huge mistake,” he said. “I made what I thought was a good choice, but my heart wasn’t in it. I felt the enormous pressure and the enormity of the show and production, and I felt I should lead with my head and go through with it.”  Once reconciled with Burnham, he said he felt like “a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.”  RELATED VIDEO: All About the 3.5-Carat Engagement Ring Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. Gave Lauren Burnham  Burnham told PEOPLE she “totally” respected Luyendyk Jr.’s decision “to follow his heart.”  “I don’t blame him for it, and I think it’s made us stronger in the end,” she said. “It was worth risking getting hurt again to see where it could go. We’ve had a lot of conversations about it, and I know he won’t change his mind again.”  “It makes things easier for me knowing that he was able to be with Becca outside of this experience and he still knew that wasn’t what he wanted,” she added. “It gives me confidence in our relationship knowing that he truly wants to be with me and he took this huge risk to make it happen.”  And both agreed that they were “very excited about marriage and starting a family” — in fact, Luyendyk Jr. said he wants two to four kids.  “If we get lucky, maybe we’d have twins!” he said.",0
"Angelina Jolie is feeling vindicated by Jennifer Aniston’s split from husband Justin Theroux. We’ve got the EXCLUSIVE details why she’s not shocked by their separation.    Jennifer Aniston, 49, and Justin Theroux‘s sudden split shocked the world, with the exception of her arch-enemy Angelina Jolie. While the 42-year-old humanitarian has long been blamed for the former Friends star’s 2005 divorce from Brad Pitt, 54, she’s now feeling a sense of vindication that she had nothing to do with America’s Sweetheart’s latest heartbreak. “Angelina makes a point to not read or follow any celebrity gossip, but it was inevitable she would hear about Jennifer and Justin’s break-up at some point. Angelina has never cared for Jen, even before she started dating Brad. She’s always thought of her as very vanilla and shallow, and not on her level intellectually. Whereas Justin is quirky and edgy and super smart, so Angelina wasn’t surprised at all to learn they had split,” a source close to the Maleficent star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  While the now former couple vowed to remain close friends despite the breakup, numerous sources out of his NYC circle seem to be feeding the media that artsy Justin felt stifled by Jen’s easy, breezy California lifestyle and longed to be back home full-time in the Big Apple. He always did seem like a somewhat strange fit for Jennifer, as the actor constantly wore nothing but black motorcycle jackets and had a gold gun pendant around his neck at all times. Everything about him seemed to exude dark, edgy rebel while the actress is a sunny yoga loving Cali-gal.  Angelina has long been blamed for Jen’s heartbreaking split from Brad after they allegedly fell in love while filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith while the actor was still very married. Even though Brangelina was together for 11 years, married in 2014 and has six children together, the United Nations humanitarian is reveling in the fact that she had nothing to do with Jennifer’s current marriage demise.  “Angelina can’t help feeling a degree of vindication, after all, she was painted as this evil home wrecker who lured Brad away from Jen, who was portrayed as this sweet and nice, poor helpless victim. But nobody can point the finger at Angelina this time, or any other ‘wicked’ third party, as by all accounts neither Justin or Jen were cheating. So this time around Jennifer can’t blame somebody else for the failure of her marriage. It’s all on her and Justin,” our insider adds. Well, at least there won’t be any more “Team Aniston” and Team Jolie” t-shirts being sold after Jen’s latest heartbreak.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Jen will go on to find true love again after her split from Justin?",1
"A Bad Moms Christmas is a 2017 American Christmas comedy film written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. It is a sequel to the 2016 film Bad Moms. The plot follows the three moms from the first film (Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn) dealing with their own mothers (Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, and Susan Sarandon) visiting during the Christmas holiday.  Principal photography on the film began in Atlanta, Georgia in May 2017, and the film was released by STXfilms in the United States on November 1, 2017. It received mixed reviews, with criticism aimed at the thin story and raunchy jokes, and grossed over $130 million worldwide.[3]  Plot [ edit ]  Amy (Mila Kunis) is now in a happy relationship with Jesse (Jay Hernandez) and is looking forward to having a simple Christmas. Her plans are derailed when her overly critical mother, Ruth (Christine Baranski), texts her to say she is coming for Christmas.  Meanwhile, Kiki (Kristen Bell) is still overworked with her four kids but now her husband Kent is much more helpful. Kiki is surprised when her mother Sandy (Cheryl Hines) shows up three days earlier than expected and is planning to spend the next three weeks with Kiki. Sandy's love for Kiki is overwhelming, and smothering Kiki.  When Carla (Kathryn Hahn) gets home, her mother, Isis (Susan Sarandon), has arrived, telling her she intends to spend time with her for the first time in years. Surprised by this turn of events Carla is excited to spend time with her. Eventually, Amy, Kiki and Carla go to the mall where they express their misery over the holidays. But while commiserating about the pressures of the holidays they make a pact to ""take Christmas back"". Ruth tries to create a spectacle out of Christmas, rather than keeping it simple like Amy wanted. In an effort to tamp down those plans Amy takes the family to Sky Zone to meet up with Kiki and Carla and their families. Ruth, Sandy and Isis all meet and chat while their daughters have fun with their kids.  At work, Carla meets an erotic dancer named Ty (Justin Hartley), who says he is competing in a Sexy Santa competition and he asks Carla to be his date, which she enthusiastically accepts. Kiki continues to have issues with her mother's overbearing ways and decides to bring Sandy to Dr. Karl (Wanda Sykes) to discuss these issues. This leads to a breakdown in communication leading to Kiki scolding Sandy and causing her to leave the session.  Amy and Kiki join Carla as they attend the Sexy Santa show. All the ladies in the room are impressed with Ty's dancing. To everyone's surprise, Isis gets up on the bar and starts dancing with Ty. Carla runs up to get Ty back, leading to a fight. When Carla brings Isis home, Isis tells her she needs money for a new investment, but Carla knows she's just going to gamble it all away and then disappear from Carla's life like it's been for years. Nonetheless, Carla relents and loans Isis the money.  On Christmas Eve, Sandy tells Kiki that she put up a cash offer for the house next door so that she can live right next to Kiki. Finally, Kiki lashes out and tells Sandy she cannot live next door and that she wants some space. Sandy leaves the room crying.  Amy gets angry with Ruth when she discovers Ruth has invited a bunch of strangers over to her home to throw an elaborate Christmas party, exactly what Amy did not want. Amy loses her temper and demands everyone leave her home and tells Ruth to leave and get out of her life forever. Her kids, Jane and Dylan, witness this outburst and become upset with Amy. Meanwhile, Carla finds a note from Isis indicating she has just taken off with the money she lent her. Kiki is all alone as well.  Ruth goes to church for Midnight Mass and is, surprisingly, joined by Sandy and Isis. All the ladies criticize each other for their efforts as mothers, with each of them realizing their flaws. Amy's father, Hank, goes to her to talk about Ruth and the horrible fight they had, but acknowledging that while Ruth can be difficult to deal with, Ruth has always been incredibly insecure, always worried whether or not she was doing a good job as a mother, but she always had the right intentions and loved Amy unconditionally. Amy goes to the church where Ruth is in order to try and repair her relationship with her mother. The two apologise to each other, with both confessing how much they genuinely love each other. Ruth tells Amy that she is a wonderful mother. The two embrace tightly. As the clock strikes midnight, Amy realises that she needs her mother to help her fix Christmas. The two rush home to start decorating the house properly.  On Christmas morning, Jane and Dylan go downstairs to see that Ruth has returned, the relationship has been repaired and the house looking wonderful with decorations and gifts. Kiki makes up with Sandy, who tells her she put the neighboring house on the market and admits that she's just always felt lonely on Christmas since Kiki's father died. Carla is then visited by Isis, who is serious about turning her life around and has a new job at Sky Zone.  All the families get together and Ruth, Sandy and Isis announce that they have become friends and are now planning to take a trip to Las Vegas.  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  In December 2016, it was announced that A Bad Moms Christmas would be released on November 3, 2017, and that it would be Christmas-themed, with Bell, Hahn, and Kunis returning to reprise their roles.[4][5] The release date was subsequently moved up two days to November 1, 2017.[6] In April 2017, Justin Hartley joined the cast of the film,[7] and in May 2017, Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, and Cheryl Hines joined as the mothers' mothers, alongside Wanda Sykes and Jay Hernandez reprising their roles from the first film.[8]  Principal photography on the film began in Atlanta, Georgia on May 1, 2017.[9][10]  Release [ edit ]  A Bad Moms Christmas was released on Wednesday, November 1, 2017. It was originally scheduled for November 3, 2017, but was pushed back two days to avoid direct competition with Thor: Ragnarok.[11]  In Australia, the film was released under the title Bad Moms 2.  Home media [ edit ]  The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on February 6, 2018 in the United States and Canada.  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  A Bad Moms Christmas grossed $72.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $58.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $130.6 million, against a production budget of $28 million.[2]  In North America, the film was projected to gross around $25 million from 3,615 theaters in its first five days (including $17 million over the weekend).[12] It took in $2.7 million on its first day,[13] and $17 million over the weekend, for a five-day total of $21.6 million, finishing second at the box office behind Thor: Ragnarok.[14]  Critical response [ edit ]  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 30% based on 116 reviews with an average rating of 4.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Featuring twice the moms but roughly half the laughs, A Bad Moms Christmas is a slapdash holiday sequel that falls short of the original with a disappointing dearth of good cheer.""[15] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[16] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B"" on an A+ to F scale, down from the ""A"" earned by the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a ""very low"" 68% overall positive score.[13]  Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a mixed review, writing, ""A Bad Moms Christmas should appeal to the same—dare I say it?—demo that Bad Moms did, even though it's not nearly as wild a comedy. It has one halfway original idea, which is that when you're a mom yourself, the ability of your own mom to drive you nuts is heightened to the third power, because you're competing on levels that are almost primal.""[17] Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood gave the film a positive review, calling it a ""good time movie"" and writing: ""...it goes way over the top, but I have to confess I laughed—a lot—and that's obviously the point even if this is not critic's fodder or meant to be. Subtle this is not, but A Bad Moms Christmas is the perfect tonic to lift your spirits and forget your troubles in these dark times.""[18]  Three New Zealanders, following in the footsteps of Kiwi heroes Tim Batt and Guy Montgomery (of ""The Worst Idea of All Time""), are watching this film every week for a year (52 times in total) for their podcast ""The Even Worse Idea of All Time"".",0
"When “Girls” premiered in April 2012, it was almost all that the TV aficionado community could talk about, and it made a giant splash in pop culture, too. Nearly everyone had a strong take on the show Lena Dunham created. Below is Part 2 of Variety’s TV critics’ reflections on the show’s legacy and impact — and why they’re both happy and sad that the story of Hannah Horvath and her friends is wrapping up. (Part 1, from before the finale aired, is here, and a post-finale talk with executive producers Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham is here.)  Sonia Saraiya: Well, that was pretty perfect. I mean, it wasn’t, but in its insular, domestic sphere, harsh reality, “Latching” is where this whole season was trending, and such a fitting counterpoint to a similarly insular but much more self-aggrandizing premiere episode of “Girls.” I appreciate that instead of being about transformation, for any of the characters, the finale emphasizes resilience — that problems arise, and our predictable anxieties will flare up, but you can get better at bouncing back.  Furthermore — I have never felt fully onboard with Hannah’s pregnancy as a plot point, and I appreciated learning that she wasn’t fully onboard with it, either. That narrative about being a new mother sounds like it may have come from Jenni Konner, who co-wrote and directed this episode, who talks about childrearing in interviews (including in a post-finale Q&A with Variety). Glimpsing a bit of “Girls” famously raw and unflinching lens directed at child-rearing is pretty satisfying.  Related 'Watchmen' Pilot Cast Revealed, Regina King in Lead Role 'Game of Thrones' Star Says Producers Are 'Absolutely Paranoid' About Spoilers  But really, what got me is that Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car” was stitched — thematically and melodically — through the episode. It’s almost not fair, because that song is wrenching enough to do a lot of emotional heavy lifting on its own. But its circularity about running away, growing up, finding home, and being someone must feel especially relevant when you’re a single mom in a house in the woods, just one car trip away from running away. In the premiere of “Girls,” Hannah asks her own parents for money; in the finale, she has to assume the mantle of grown-up, even though she’s scared s–itless, mostly because someone has to do it, and she can’t quit now. But is this what she wanted? Is she happy? Or is her settled contentment at the end, once Grover has finally started breastfeeding, about as good as it gets in this life? “Fast Car” doesn’t have easy answers, and I liked that “Latching” doesn’t either.  Maureen Ryan: Oh “Girls,” you did the most “Girls” thing possible: After loving most of the lyrical and emotionally acute final season, I spent a good chunk of the finale wanting to scream and fending off a migraine. For me, the combative self-absorption of the characters just felt overly familiar and the setting a little too claustrophobic, and for the first two-thirds of the episode, a lot of the post-birth story played out in ways that I found frustrating rather than illuminating. I see where you’re coming from, and the last few minutes were sweet and memorable, but in the main, I found this particular variety of “Girls” episode — argumentative and somewhat predictable — more off-putting than most. So here we are, having one more critical argument about “Girls” — yay?  The thing is, many different TV shows have hauled out the difficulties of parenting a newborn to manufacture drama or conflict, so the topics on display and the treatments of them just felt overly familiar to me. And perhaps Marnie’s oblivious self-absorption was meant to be funny, but we’ve seen that so many times before, and given the stakes — i.e., the life and health of a baby — her condescending selfishness really grated on me throughout much of the final half-hour. This being “Girls,” perhaps her behavior was meant to annoy, but that’s a flavor that can get old fast.  It wasn’t until the great Becky Ann Baker showed up to school everybody that I could actually begin to find a few shreds of enjoyment in the finale. The upside is, all the yelling and crying and immaturity made me more than OK than with the fact that this show — which I have often loved, especially this season — is ending. Good luck, little Grover. (She really named her kid Grover? Hannah. You did not have to do that. Sigh.)  Saraiya: How funny that you are positive about the show, but not about the finale, while I am almost vice-versa. I liked “Latching,” though I admit that I have no idea what to make of the fact that Hannah’s son is a brown baby — and will grow up to be a man of color. With this show’s relationship to racial dynamics, something about this feels strangely superficial. Of course, at this point, “Girls” is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn’t — but isn’t it a bit odd that It’s never discussed or dealt with, it’s just, oh yeah, Hannah’s having a brown baby? The show’s deep-seated discomfort with engaging with race never disappeared, despite six seasons of us talking about it.  In Part 1, you wrote that you always found “Girls” to be sincere. That struck me while watching the finale and pondering this baby, because I was so often frustrated that the show wasn’t sincere with its setups — there was this surreality or fantasy-level to the characters’ lives that made them more ciphers than characters. Even in this final season, which has been one of the most grounded, I read this long piece about how Hannah’s salaried-with-benefits teaching job at a cushy lib arts school upstate is essentially impossible. Maybe what you were saying is that the show always meant well — but even that, I’m not always so sure about. I’m not saying I’m ascribing evil motives to the show either. But like, I think sometimes the show was going for the best joke, or the most interesting denouement, not the one it felt the most strongly about.  In its defense, though, I think “Girls” was as much about Dunham and co. making characters out of the idiosyncrasies and silliness that they themselves were experiencing in the high creative echelons of contemporary hipsterdom. Hannah the writer, Ray the failed artist, Adam the actor, Marnie the “musician,” Shosh the publicist, Jessa from rehab — and on, and on. That person you know who moved upstate to have a kid on her own. That girl who got engaged two weeks after meeting someone and seems very happy. The one whose marriage fell apart and is now having some obscure experience of personal growth in another state. We don’t have tell-all novels, a la Jay McInerney or Bret Easton Ellis, about the New York arty media scene anymore: now we have shows like “Girls” to deliver second- or thirdhand gossip.  This cements one of my long-held feelings about the show, which is that more than being aimed at millennials, it was a show about millennials for millennials’ parents. Not you, Mo, you proud Gen X-er, but those homeowning HBO subscribers who want to ask what their kids are doing but maybe don’t feel so comfortable asking about “crack-cidents” on the phone. I don’t think it’s insignificant that this series has been as much about Becky Ann Baker’s transformation, as Hannah’s mom, as it has been about Hannah herself. (She was just fantastic in the finale.)  Ryan: I think you’re onto something there. I once wrote a long piece about the similarities between Liz Phair and Lena Dunham (who both went to Oberlin, and who both were lionized and torn apart in equal measure for their creative exploits — 20 years apart). We touched on this briefly in Part 1 of our dialogue, this idea of voyeurism: I would bet most HBO subscribers have never lived in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but they want a window into that world, just like they want to know, on Sunday nights, what’s up in the realm of dragons and Lannisters. You’re so right about this being the Jay McInerney or Tama Janowitz novel of its time. Who has the time to read the hot new novelist’s take on what the cool people are doing in NYC? But we can watch this show and feel at least partially informed about what the Youngs are up to.  I recall that somewhat early in the show’s run, a bunch of stories were published on the topic of how a goodly number of middle-aged male HBO subscribers watched “Girls.” Well, why wouldn’t they? Not only would it make all those tuition-paying dads feel like they knew what was up in their kids’ lives, “Girls” contended with the issues surrounding masculinity and intimacy that a lot of other prestige shows explore, but with a lot fewer murders and brothels.  Hannah grappled with a lot of things — her narcissism, her difficulty in sustaining jobs and relationships, her parents’ breakup, and now, this season, an unexpected pregnancy. But I’ve been thinking a lot about that the fact that a huge throughline of the show has concerned the reality that the men in Hannah’s life were often both more and less than she could handle, and she was never quite sure what to do about that. (As Hannah herself notes, Grover was just the latest in a long list of males with whom she had difficulties, though he was probably also the cutest. And not to sidestep the race thing, but it’s really strange to me that Hannah wouldn’t address the fact that she is parenting a non-white boy. You’d think that would be the exact sort of thing she’d monologue about, and I can definitely see why you felt that aspect of the story felt tacked-on.)  But speaking of men in general, I think a lot of women watching could relate to the issues that Hannah and all the other women contended with when it came to the guys in their lives. Weirdly enough, there were a lot of moments in which the men felt as though they were more dimensionalized than the women — in a show called “Girls.” It was one more conundrum to contend with, I suppose.  That said, I don’t feel all that cheated about who grew most or least, given that, as you say, for most of the characters on the show, they didn’t grow a ton. As was the case with Don Draper, I think they got better at recognizing and accepting their flaws, and seeing past their own pain and self-absorption and at least attempting altruism on a regular basis (the presence of a helpless baby in your life will often force that kind of accelerated growth on a person). Over time, though they were still spectacularly myopic at times, the show undeniably got better at depicting them sometimes stepping past the landmines that they, in the past, would have embraced in a fairly unthinking way.  Saraiya: This is interesting, because I wouldn’t have come to this conclusion. I never felt the show was interrogating its men. Adam is a great character, and has really grown on me, but I don’t think the show has ever really investigated what was behind his pent-up rage and desire to humiliate his sexual partners in the first season — the negging, almost, that characterized his affection for Hannah. I mean, he ended up with Jessa, who two episodes ago admitted she was a sociopath. Ray is a curmudgeon, and the show kind of embraces that; but along the way he’s used Shoshana pretty abominably. Laird is out here still hitting on Hannah. And while Elijah is, again, played very well by Andrew Rannells, I’m not so sure that he’s learned or grown or anything. If “Girls” is anything, it’s the show of barely perceptible character development.  On the other hand, though, it’s probably significant that Hannah has not a girl baby but a boy — Grover, the name for the cutest boy muppet. And throughout the finale, Hannah makes these funny comments like “Men are disgusting!” for no real reason. Maybe for Dunham, “Girls” was partly an effort to redeem men. It seems she may have succeeded.  Ryan: You may be right — along with the show, I may not have investigated the motivations and actions of the male characters as much as I could have. I think that might be partly for a defensible reason — damn, this cast was so good. It was hard not to be forgiving (possibly too forgiving) when the characters were this unpredictable and often hilarious in their oddity and messy, fascinating humanity. Alex Karpovsky, Adam Driver, Andrew Rannells and Peter Scolari were just so fun to watch, no matter how weak or selfish or weird their characters were, and Chris O’Dowd saying “That was my Humie” in his epic final fight with Jessa ranks in my Top 5 “Girls” lines ever. Elijah was often the comic relief, but Rannells could turn on a dime and almost make me cry, even when he was just running lines in a department store.  Would you agree that the members of the cast — particularly the core four women — have become better actors, in some cases shockingly so, since the show began? It’s not that I think anyone was bad back in 2012, but there were moments when I wondered about the range and versatility of some of the performers. The assurance that they have now, and the wide array of emotions that they can lock into, I find, is truly remarkable. Dunham in particular has been able to work in small gestures and very subtle emotional shades this season. She’s really been exceptional. And it didn’t surprise me that Allison Williams was so good in “Get Out” because she’s grown tremendously on “Girls” in the last few years. Am I wrong about that?  Saraiya: Oh, absolutely. Dunham in particular has become a much stronger actress. Her scene with Jemima Kirke in the penultimate episode, “Goodbye Tour,” is striking for just how emotive both are after spending so many seasons playing robotic caricatures. I’m inclined to think that Williams’ performance has stayed the same, but the writers’ sense of irony towards her has heightened (and in “Get Out,” she is entirely manufactured, which of course makes perfect sense). The show has also been characterized by performers that were already great, right from the start: Becky Ann Baker, Andrew Rannells, Adam Driver, Zosia Mamet, and Alex Karpovsky (who in some episodes stole the show from Dunham).  Ryan: Agreed. To wrap things up, here’s the greatest compliment I can pay any show, and I think “Girls” certainly merits it: I know I’ll spend time thinking about what all these men and women are up to, even though I won’t get to check in on their lives and loves and aspirations any time soon. How will they get on? Will they find ways to support each other, even as they stumble over the bigger obstacles and frustrations life is likely to throw at them in the next couple of decades? If there is a reunion movie several years from now, I’d eagerly watch that (and of course it’s no sure thing that this great cast, all of whom deserve to go on to bigger and better things, will not too busy to be reassembled). What’s great is that I honestly can’t fully picture the trajectory of each character, though I like to imagine a future in which Ray is the mayor of New York, or at least the crankiest dad in Brooklyn.  These characters frustrated me, they entertained me, they shook up what was possible on television. They made me re-examine my assumptions and they prompted some of the best conversations I’ve ever had about this medium that we love. Hannah Horvath, you forced me to think harder and to dig deeper, and I don’t know if I fully got what “Girls” was going for all the time, but I’m truly grateful for the provocations and the laughs and the unpredictable ride.  I can easily picture Grover reminiscing about his mom 20 years from now, when he’s sitting on the lawn of some well-regarded liberal arts college.  “She’s a lot,” he’ll probably say, “but it was an adventure every day.”",0

"The U.S. Supreme Court declined without comment Monday to hear the appeal of Brendan Dassey, whose murder conviction was the subject of the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer.""  Interested in Making a Murderer? Add Making a Murderer as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Making a Murderer news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  In 2007, Dassey was convicted as a teenager, along with his uncle Steven Avery, of murdering photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier before burning her body. He was sentenced to life in prison.  “We will continue to fight to free Brendan Dassey. Brendan was a sixteen-year-old with intellectual and social disabilities when he confessed to a crime he did not commit. The video of Brendan’s interrogation shows a confused boy who was manipulated by experienced police officers into accepting their story of how the murder of Teresa Halbach happened,"" Laura Nirider, an attorney for Dassey told ABC News in a statement Monday.  ""These officers repeatedly assured him that everything would be ‘okay’ if he just told them what they wanted to hear and then fed him facts so that Brendan’s ‘confession’ fit their theory of the crime. By the end of the interrogation, Brendan was so confused that he actually thought he was going to return to school after confessing to murder. Nonetheless, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on the basis of this ‘confession.’""  In 2015, Dassey's story rose to the national spotlight when his interrogation was shown as part of the Netflix series, ""Making a Murderer,"" which raised questions about the case.  Dassey's attorneys argued that their client is borderline intellectually disabled and was coerced into a false confession. They wanted his confession thrown out and were requesting a new trial.  “When you use these tactics on someone like Brendan, who is young, inexperienced with the police, naïve, compliant and suggestible, then you run the risk of getting coerced and false confessions,"" his attorney Steve Drizin said in February after asking the Supreme Court to review the case.  There was no physical evidence linking him to the murder, but Dassey was convicted based on statements he gave to Wisconsin investigators.",0
"Melanie “Mel B” Brown and husband Stephen Belafonte seem to have settled some of the issues in their contentious divorce ahead of their trial, set to begin Nov. 13.  The couple, who are ending their marriage after 10 years wed, reached an agreement in the domestic violence portion of their divorce, TMZ reports — with the former Spice Girl agreeing to drop the temporary restraining order she filed in April against Belafonte.  Brown, 42, had accused her ex of physically and emotionally abusing her, alleging in her TRO filing that she was “in fear” for her life and that Belafonte’s alleged abuse ramped up when her career was on an upswing.  Belafonte, 42, and Brown — who wed in Las Vegas in June 2007 — also settled a portion of their property division, TMZ reports.  A rep for Brown did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  Melanie ""Mel B"" Brown and Stephen Belafonte Phillip Faraone/Getty  The former couple’s divorce has been a nasty battle since Brown filed in March and asked for joint legal and physical custody of their 6-year-old daughter, Madison. Brown also requested to terminate the court’s ability to award spousal support in her filing. (PEOPLE confirmed in July Brown was ordered to pay Belafonte $40,000 per month in temporary spousal support and pay for $140,000 in attorney fees and forensic fees on Belafonte’s behalf.)  Amid her restraining order filings in April, Brown claimed that Belafonte hired a German exchange student, Lorraine Gilles, to be their nanny and pitted the two women against each other. Brown claimed the nanny’s relationship with Belafonte became sexual and that he impregnated her before demanding an abortion.  She was granted a restraining order against Gilles in April, but Gilles in turn sued Brown for defamation, claiming her pregnancy was the result of a one-night stand. Their battle remains unresolved.  RELATED VIDEO: Forced Threesomes and Injury Coverups: The Biggest Bombshell Allegations from Mel B’s Restraining Order Against Her Ex  Meanwhile in October, new details of Brown and Belafonte’s marriage emerged in a court proceeding in Los Angeles, with Brown claiming Belafonte drugged her throughout “much to most” of the relationship, according to his lawyer, Philip Cohen, as reported by multiple outlets.  “Miss Brown now takes the position she was drugged by Mr. Belafonte throughout the course of the marriage,” Cohen said in L.A. Superior Court. Belafonte and his legal team responded to Brown’s allegations, claiming they are “nothing more than a smear campaign.”  Also in court in October, Brown’s lawyers said Belafonte had at least 56 videos, a third of which were “of a sexual nature,” according to The Sun. Susan Wiesner, a member of Brown’s legal team, said “90 percent” of the videos were of the former Spice Girl and were made without Brown’s consent. Belafonte’s lawyers dismissed the claim, arguing that the videos were “consensual.”  Hearings between Brown and Belafonte’s legal teams remain ongoing.",1
"Recognizing The Potential And Perils Of A 'Limitless' Mind  Enlarge this image istockphoto istockphoto  Imagine a pill that would give you tremendous intellectual power, triggering an avalanche of neuronal activity, igniting your brain into unparalleled awareness. You take the little thing and, for a few hours, you are a god-like creature. This is the premise of Limitless, the movie directed by Neil Burger, based on the novel by Alan Glynn and starring Bradley Cooper as the loser-writer who is turned into a genius by the powers of a psychotropic drug.  What if we had tremendous amounts of brainpower that remain untapped, powers that the dullness of our everyday routine dims into mere occasional insights, little flashes of awareness of a deeper reality that enfolds all that is? Could we really step into this different realm of being, freeing ourselves from the ""triviality"" that comes from using only a small percentage of our cortical mass?  There is a widespread myth out there, that we use only about 10 percent of our brain. We actually use all of it; every part of the brain has a known function. Otherwise, we would have certainly evolved smaller brains, or brains that are less costly metabolically.  So, the point is not that we need to activate large parts of our dormant brain, but that we need to trigger more efficient neuronal connections between the many parts: the secret is in increasing the pathways, making them resonate together in more creative ways.  Could a pill do such a thing?  We don't know, certainly not now. But look at where we are now: millions of people, including children, are taking Adderall and Vyvanse, psychostimulants composed of different kinds of amphetamine. The drugs increase the amount of dopamine in the brain, raising focus, libido and overall cognitive alertness. They are, in a very real sense, the baby versions of NZT 48, the magic pill in Limitless. No wonder those who take these medications must hide them so that they don't get stolen. (Especially in college dorms.)  The movie echoes precisely this reality, amplifying it with the help of fiction: if there is a magic pill that makes you into a genius, or at least more focused and intellectually productive, everyone, or at least many people, will want it.  It's another version of the Faustian bargain, where now the Devil wears the clothes of a pharmaceutical company salesperson; or a drug dealer.  I won't tell you how the movie ends. But I'd like to point out an interesting parallel with a remarkable sci-fi novel by the British writer Colin Wilson, The Philosopher's Stone, published in 1969.  In the novel, it wasn't a pill that gave the protagonist unprecedented brain power but the targeted electric stimulation of certain areas of the prefrontal cortex, which was described as ""some kind of extra storage area ... the centre of poetry and intelligence."" The premise of the novel is that the brain contains in it all of our past and future, if only we knew how to tap into its amazing reservoirs of timeless power. The ""freed man"" becomes a seer, a prophet, a genius, a god.  There are all sorts of hidden meanings in the universe, but we are blind to most of them. Occasionally, someone of genius, a great poet, a musician, a scientist, peers into the fog, even if only momentarily. What the protagonists of Limitless and The Philosopher's Stone are after is the ability to keep the light shining permanently.  Can we turn all the lights on without burning a central fuse? Is there a real advantage to pursuing a limitless mind? The movie makes it clear that the advantages we already have will remain even after taking the drug, that is, if you are smarter without it you will be smarter after taking it; the differentials between different IQs remain.  Perhaps here we can extract the true lesson of the movie and the novel: hard as it is, we must learn to accept our limitations while trying to constantly transcend them. To me, what makes life interesting is the search for the right balance between these two trends.",0

"California corrections officials on Friday began accepting public comments on the new set of regulations that have overhauled the state parole system, allowing thousands more inmates to be considered for early release.  State regulators gave the guidelines initial approval in April . They have been used to implement Proposition 57, which was approved by 65% of voters in November and is expected to reduce the statewide prison population by 11,500 inmates over the next four years.  The sweeping initiative provided new ways for all inmates to earn time credits toward their sentences for good behavior and for enrolling in certain career, rehabilitation and education programs. It also allows the State Board of Parole Hearings to grant early release to a whole new population of inmates: prisoners whose primary sentences are for crimes not designated as “violent” under California law and have served the full term of their sentences.",0
"Beyond the Wall is the sixth episode of the seventh season of Game of Thrones. It is the sixty-sixth episode of the series overall. It premiered on August 20, 2017. It was written by David Benioff & D.B. Weiss and directed by Alan Taylor.  Contents show]  Plot  Jon and the Brotherhood hunt the dead. Arya confronts Sansa. Tyrion thinks about the future.  Summary  At Winterfell  At Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death.  Arya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay.  Sansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear.  Later, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice.  The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself.  Following the events of the Wight Hunt, Sansa enters Arya's quarters and opens a leather case containing several ""faces"", including the literally late Walder Frey's face. Arya catches her sister pilfering through her personal effects. When Sansa tells Arya that her men are loyal to her, Arya mockingly retorts that they are not here. Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the ""faces"" are.  Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger.  The Wight Hunt  At Dragonstone castle, Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to ""heroes"" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom ""do stupid things, trying to outdo the others"". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her – to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward. The two then turn their attention to the topic of their impending meeting with Queen Cersei in King's Landing. Tyrion admits that Cersei cannot be trusted and could be setting a trap for them, but that Daenerys will have the Unsullied, the Dothraki and her dragons at hand; if anyone tries to harm her, King's Landing will be leveled in response.  Daenerys wonders whether, given that Cersei will almost certainly be attempting to double-cross them, they should be planning something similar. Tyrion is firmly against any deceit, counseling Daenerys that while she needs a healthy degree of fear to instill respect, she cannot rule through fear alone, as leaders who rule through fear alone like Cersei, Tywin, and Joffrey are hated by their people and forever vulnerable to being overthrown. Tyrion reminds Daenerys about her vision of creating a new society by ""breaking the wheel"" rather than merely imitating prior rulers like Aegon Targaryen, and cautions her about her temper and impulsiveness, citing the fiery executions of Lord Randyll Tarly and his son Dickon. Daenerys asserts that such an action was necessary, but Tyrion still believes she should have attempted more merciful means of dealing with the problem the Tarlys posed, or at least left them alive long enough to consider her other options rather than having them summarily executed. As Daenerys becomes increasingly agitated in the face of Tyrion's blunt but reasonable remarks, he reassures Daenerys that he supports her vision and ideals. Tyrion also proposes that Daenerys consider a succession plan in the event of a disaster, given that by her own admission, she believes she is incapable of bearing children. She refuses to consider this plan until she has donned the crown, also coldly blaming Tyrion's policy of caution for causing her the loss of Highgarden, Ellaria Sand, and Yara Greyjoy.  Jon Snow and his ranging party travel through the lands beyond the wall on their mission to capture a wight. Gendry complains about the bitter cold and asks Tormund about life as a Wildling. Tormund later confides with Jon about the foolhardy nature of their mission, while Jon discusses his difficult negotiations with Daenerys. Tormund points out that the pride of the Northmen may cost them too many lives, citing Mance Rayder and the Wildlings as an example. While walking, Gendry also confronts the Brotherhood Without Banners about selling him off as a sacrifice to Melisandre. Sandor Clegane sneers that Gendry should be grateful that he is still alive and points out that Beric Dondarrion has been killed six times (including once by Sandor himself) ""and you don't hear him bitching about it"". Not entirely sure what to think of that particular revelation, Gendry accepts a drink from Thoros's wineskin.  While walking, Jon and Jorah Mormont also chat about their relationships with their fathers Eddard Stark and Jeor Mormont respectively. They say that their fathers were good and honorable men and did not deserve their deaths. Jon tells Jorah about the brutal death of Jeor at the hands of the Mutineers and that Eddard was beheaded. Jon tries to return to Jorah his father's Valyrian sword Longclaw but Jorah tells him that he is not worthy to bear his father's sword, having forfeited any claim to it when he brought shame into his House. His father gave the sword to Jon, and gives his blessing for Jon and his future children to keep it.  Later, Sandor and Tormund trade jabs about sex. Sandor takes offense when Tormund asks about how he burnt his face. Tormund then confides in Sandor about his infatuation for Brienne of Tarth, who is nearly as tall as Sandor. He jokes about having ""monstrous"" babies with her, to Sandor's utter bewilderment. Beric and Jon talk about Eddard Stark and how they have both been resurrected by worshipers of the Lord of Light. Beric tells Jon that he is fighting for life because death is the first and last enemy; it is inevitable, but it is human nature to fight it for as long as you can. He warns Jon that they have to work together to fight death and defend those who cannot defend themselves. Jon reflects on his Night's Watch oath about being the ""shield that guards the realms of men"" and agrees. Sandor sees the mountain from his vision lying ahead and steers the group in that direction.  While trudging through a snowstorm, Jon and his party sight a massive snow bear with blue eyes approaching them. The snow bear turns out to have been resurrected by a White Walker. The monstrous creature mauls and kills three of their company. Beric and Thoros manage to set the snow bear alight with his flaming sword but it continues to attack, forcing Thoros to get in its' way when it attacks Sandor. Thoros is unable to break free of its jaws until Jorah stabs it with a dragonglass dagger. Beric cauterizes Thoros' wounds with his flaming sword.  Jorah asks the wounded Thoros about his experience charging with a flaming sword during the Siege of Pyke, and commends his old comrade for his drunken bravery. While navigating through the mountain, they see a column of Wights marching through the canyon below. The ranging party plants a fire and then ambushes the wights and the White Walker leading the pack. Jon manages to kill the White Walker with Longclaw, causing most of the Wights associated with it to disintegrate, while the rest of the group manages to capture the only unaffected wight. The creature unexpectedly screeches for help; Sandor slaps his gloved hand over its mouth, but it wrenches its face away when its mouth skin tears off into the glove, to Sandor and Jorah's disgust. As Jorah pulls out a bag from his jacket and secures it over its head, Sandor and Tormund bind the creature. In the middle of this, they realize they can hear a massive host of wights heading their way, hastening their work.  As the noise of the horde approaches, Jon sends Gendry back to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to bring news to Daenerys as he's the fastest. Gendry gives his war hammer to Tormund, who hands it to Sandor who has the wight slung over his shoulder. The wights pursue the group over a lake of weak ice, as they flee toward a large stone island jutting out in the middle. One of the party trips and falls behind; a few of the horde tackles him, the combined weight breaks the ice, and they fall through. This causes a chain reaction of breaking ice all around the rock until the horde slows to a stop to avoid the water. Throughout the night, Jon and his comrades wait in the middle of the ice while encircled by the army of the undead. Meanwhile, Gendry reaches Eastwatch's outer gates but collapses from exhaustion. Davos Seaworth and several guards attend to him. When Davos asks what happened, Gendry tells him to prepare a raven; Davos orders to bring the Maester.  In the morning, Jon and his company awake to find that Thoros has died from his wounds. Beric and Sandor pay their last respects, with the former praying for the Lord of Light to guard them. At Jon's insistence, they burn the body with Beric's flaming sword so Thoros can't be reanimated. The wights watch while their captive Wight struggles under its hood and restraints. Jorah proposes killing the wight but Jon counters that they need to keep it as evidence. Beric suggests that Jon kill the Night King, who has just arrived on horseback; given that they've seen killing a Walker destroyed the wights it controlled, killing the Night King might destroy them all. He then adds that the Lord of Light has not resurrected Jon for no reason, but Sandor reminds him that they have just lost their priest, and Beric is now down to his last life.  After receiving Gendry's message from Eastwatch, Tyrion implores Queen Daenerys, who has donned a cold-weather version of her Targaryen garb, not to leave for the North because it is too risky. Daenerys counters that he told her to do nothing before and she lost. Dissatisfied with his advice, Dany leaves with all three dragons to the lands beyond the Wall to aid Jon Snow and his ranging party.  Bored, Sandor hurls two rocks at one of the undead minions, knocking its jaw off. The second however, skids across the ice, and both the party and the undead quickly realize the ice, which has hardened overnight, is strong enough to support their weight, and in ever-increasing numbers, the horde attacks the group's position. Sandor holds them back with Gendry's hammer while Jon and the other members of the ranging party join in, wielding weapons of fire, dragonglass or Valyrian steel. Beric manages to set several of the wights alight with his flaming sword. The ranging party hack and slash at the wights with their blades but are unable to stem the tide. With the group overwhelmed, Jon orders them to fall back to the highest part of the island. Tormund is overwhelmed by several wights and is nearly dragged under the ice, but is saved by Sandor, who drags him back onto the island. The group continues fighting against the wights. One of the Wildlings falls off a ledge and is ripped apart by the creatures, who begin to scramble up the ledge towards the living.  When all seems lost, Queen Daenerys arrives with her dragons, who attack the wights with dragonfire. Hundreds of wights are burned to ashes while others collapse under the ice, which is melted by dragonfire. Jon and his party rush to Daenerys and her dragon Drogon, dragging their captive wight with them, while Viserion and Rhaegal provide covering fire from above. Meanwhile, the Night King obtains an icy javelin from one of his lieutenants and hurls it at Viserion, scoring a direct hit. Viserion is struck in the neck and plunges helplessly into freefall, shrieking in agony as blood and fire pour from the fatal wound. Drogon and Rhaegal cry out for their brother, but are powerless to help him as Daenerys watches in horror and sorrow. Viserion crashes onto the frozen lake, shattering the ice, and slowly sinks beneath it.  As the Night King readies another spear, Jon hollers at Daenerys and company to leave with her remaining dragons before being dragged under the ice by two wights. Daenerys and the survivors of Jon's ranging expedition flee with Drogon and Rhaegal before the Night King can kill them. He hurls the second javelin, but Drogon narrowly dodges it. With the dragons gone, the Night King and his army leave the scene. Later, Jon Snow climbs out of the ice and regains Longclaw. Jon is quickly spotted and pursued by a large horde. Before the wights can finish the King in the North, his long-lost uncle Benjen Stark appears on horseback with his flaming flail. Benjen tells Jon to flee on his horse while he stays behind to buy time for Jon to escape. While riding away on horseback, Jon watches his uncle being overwhelmed by the undead.  At Eastwatch, Sandor carries the struggling Wight into a boat. Tormund and Beric tell him they will meet again but Sandor retorts he hopes not. Daenerys sends Drogon and Rhaegal to scour the surrounding mountains for Jon. Jorah tells Daenerys that it is time to leave but she insists on waiting a bit longer. Before she can leave, they hear a horn blowing signalling a rider approaching. Looking down from the battlements, Dany sees a wounded Jon Snow approaching on horseback. Aboard their ship, Davos and Gendry tend to Jon Snow, who has suffered severe hypothermia and several minor injuries. Daenerys also notes the massive scars on his chest from his previous fatal wounds.  In the Narrow Sea, Jon Snow wakes to find Daenerys watching over him in his chambers. Jon apologizes for the disastrous ranging party and the fact it caused Viserion's death, but Daenerys tells him not to apologize because she now knows that the Army of the Dead is real. Overcome with emotion, she tells Jon that the dragons are the only children she will ever have, and vows that she and Jon will together destroy the Night King. Jon thanks her for her support, addressing her as ""Dany"", and Daenerys realizes that the last person to address her by that name was her older brother Viserys Targaryen, who Daenerys remembers as not being a good person. Jon apologizes and asks if ""My Queen"" would be more appropriate; realizing he is agreeing to bend the knee, Daenerys asks Jon what the Northern lords loyal to him will make of this. Jon assures her they will come to see her for the good person she is, as he already has. Touched by his statement, Daenerys gently takes Jon's hand in her own for a moment. They gaze into each other's eye for a moment – a long moment – but Daenerys suddenly pulls away and tells him to get some rest and leaves him alone.  Later, hundreds of Wights use several large chains to drag Viserion's corpse out of the frozen lake as the Night King and one of his lieutenants watch. When the dragon's corpse is dragged far enough out of the lake, the Night King walks over and places his hand upon Viserion's snout. All is quiet for a moment... and then Viserion's eyes snap open, shining a depthless, icy blue.  Production  Cast  Cast notes  Appearances  First  Deaths  Notes  General  Dragons traveling to the Wall  It is totally impossible that a raven could be sent to Dragonstone, and then Daenerys could ride her dragons back to the Wall, in the only one or two days , at most, that Jon's group was trapped by the White Walkers. The distance from the Wall to Dragonstone is half a continent – Cersei even stated in dialogue that Westeros is ""a continent"" two episodes ago in ""The Spoils of War"". The Title sequence of the TV series itself even visually depicts a map indicating the vast distance between Dragonstone and the Wall. There is no possible in-universe explanation for this. Given that the showrunners have admitted that the Wight Hunt doesn't even happen in future novels, it appears that they wanted to have Daenerys swoop in to save Jon instead of, without a raven, Daenerys changing her mind and deciding to head North to help Jon, in which case she could have spent over a week flying to the Wall catching up with them. Instead, the episode clearly establishes that Gendry had a raven sent from the Wall to Dragonstone, and then Daenerys flew her dragons to the Wall after receiving the letter, in enough time to save Jon's party while they were trapped on the island in the frozen lake. Ignoring, for the sake of argument, that the top flight distance and speed of dragons has never entirely been confirmed, the speed of the messenger-raven network across Westeros has been established. Even giving the over-generous assumption that Jon's group survived at most two days on the island in the ice lake (and it seems more like one, until the ice refroze), and using the assumption that dragons can fly from Dragonstone to the Wall in a single day, this would be claiming that a messenger-raven sent from the Wall could reach Dragonstone in at most a single day. Prior seasons have repeatedly shown that the messenger-raven network isn't nearly the fast, with messages taking days or sometimes weeks to cross large distances – particularly, the distance of half a continent from the Wall to Dragonstone (Dragonstone is roughly about as far from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as King's Landing was from Castle Black in prior seasons). Even this is assuming that it wasn't one raven in a direct flight, but fresh ravens spreading the message to new castles in a chain (i.e. like a human messenger switching to a fresh horse at each new castle he passed so he could ride for two days in a row, instead of staying on the same horse and tiring him to death).  It is totally impossible that a raven could be sent to Dragonstone, and then Daenerys could ride her dragons back to the Wall, in the only , at most, that Jon's group was trapped by the White Walkers.

Earlier in Season 7, writer and staff loremaster Bryan Cogman was repeatedly questioned by fans over Twitter that certain characters are moving around too fast in Season 7, rushing to get them where they need to be for plot points without thought to realism. Cogman countered that these were still plausible movements, given that they avoided saying how much time passes between episodes (i.e. for all we know, it took Grey Worm months to reach Casterly Rock from Dragonstone, and ships travel faster than land armies). The week before this episode aired, however, he quit Twitter and closed his account, so he can't field any new questions about this even greater case of time compression. [2]  Director Alan Taylor responded in an interview with The New York Times , ""I've only looked at one review online, and it was very much concerned with the speed of the ravens. I thought, that's funny — you don't seem troubled by the lizard as big as a 747, but you’re really concerned about the speed of a raven. It is true there are time issues, and I'm not exactly sure how many kilometers there are between Eastwatch and Dragonstone. But it was a bit dreary to hear somebody who said, ""I cannot enjoy this episode because, you know, that speed of that raven...'"" He suggested that more time may have passed on the island than was implied, ""since it's always sort of an eternal twilight north of the Wall."" [3] Taylor went on to insist, ""They seemed to be very concerned about how fast a raven can fly but there’s a thing called plausible impossibilities, which is what you try to achieve, rather than impossible plausibilities. So I think we were straining plausibility a little bit, but I hope the story’s momentum carries over some of that stuff."" He insists that a raven flying from the Wall to Dragonstone in this short of an amount of time, while unlikely, is still within the realm of physical possibility. As for waving aside ""a lizard as big as a 747"" as an example that the storyline is fantastic to begin with, they already established in their fictional world how fast dragons are - and then broke their own rules. This is sometimes called the ""Magic A is Magic A"" principle, that even in Science Fiction & Fantasy worlds in which ""magic"" and magical creatures exist, once a set of rules have been established for them, those rules have to be followed consistently. Otherwise, it undermines the integrity of the story: by the same principle, for example, Highgarden could have sent a raven to Dragonstone when it came under attack earlier in the season, and Daenerys could have flown her dragons to defend it rather than let her Tyrell allies be slaughtered (and Highgarden is a shorter distance from Dragonstone than the Wall).  , ""I've only looked at one review online, and it was very much concerned with the speed of the ravens.

Martin of The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook, commented on this after the episode. She calculated (based on flights from Dragonstone to King's Landing) that it would take a dragon about 28 hours flying continuously at top speed to travel from the King's Landing/Dragonstone region to the Wall - which she regarded as implausible, because a dragon can't fly continuously for that long. This is comparable to saying a horse could plausibly reach a destination if it ran at a full racing-speed gallop for 28 hours straight: mathematically it could, but it can't physically maintain that speed for even remotely that long. [4] She went on to say, however, that the raven network is so much slower than this (as confirmed by better citations), that there is no plausible way one could carry a message from the Wall to Dragonstone in enough time for Daenerys and her dragons to react to it, then fly to save Jon. She concluded, ""This would be the Game of Thrones episode where they broke the plot so badly that suspension of disbelief is well and truly dead.""

The implausibility of the Wall-to-Dragonstone-and-back travel time in this episode was widely criticized by major media reviewers: Lauren Sarner of Inverse said: "" In any fantasy narrative, throwing established rules out the window is dangerous, since it’s a genre that relies upon world building. A world doesn’t make sense — and isn’t compelling — if it has no clear limits, because then there are no stakes. Whether there are ten fans or millions of fans, a fantasy story can’t debunk its own rules and hope that nobody notices."" [6] Karthryn VanArendonk of Vulture/NYMag said: ""Does it matter that the Game of Thrones timeline makes absolutely no sense? We’re long past the point of arguing that time within the world of the show actually works, but if you are a person who cares about this sort of thing — if a disregard for how fast fictional bodies could reasonably move around a fictional map was ever going to disrupt your ability to enjoy dragon battles — then Sunday’s episode is the one that finally tipped you over the edge."" [7] Lili Loofbourow of The Week said: ""'Beyond the Wall' was — for many — a bridge too far. The idea that Daenerys could show up just in the nick of time given the circumstances makes absolutely no sense (here's an in-depth breakdown). Nor was that the biggest stretch of the episode...The explanation for these holes is that there is no explanation; the people making this show literally just don't care about those details anymore...imagine not caring enough to nail down a remotely plausible timeline because you can't be bothered. You'll just hope the spectacle is big enough to make everyone forget the gaps in the plot - it worked so well for the Waif's final fight with Arya, after all!...The chains of causation that made the Red Wedding devastating but understandable are gone."" [8] Sarah Weymes of WinterIsComing.net reacted to Alan Taylor's lack of a coherent response to the travel time issues: ""The fact that Alan Taylor asked us to suspend our disbelief in reference to the unfeasible timeline because 'there are dragons' is a little insulting. As far as I’m aware, the presence of dragons should have no bearing on Gendry’s ability to sprint a great distance like he’s got a rocket shoved up his bottom. Genre should not act as a stand-in for common sense. A lot of the episode didn’t make sense. The least the showrunners can do is own it."" [9] Kyle Neubeck of Collider said: ""The setup that brought us here is extraordinarily, impressively stupid."" [10] Kevin Yeoman of Screencrant said: ""[Does having the Night King get a zombie-dragon] really outweigh Gendry's miraculous spring back to the Wall, or the raven's seemingly faster-than-light travel to Dragonstone requesting Dany's help? All season long Game of Thrones has been playing fast and loose with the rules of geography and time, and for the most part it could be shrugged off so long as you believed the appropriate amount of time had passed. Here, though, the immediacy of the situation takes that option off the table, and the storytelling is weakened as a result."" [11] Adam Chitwood of Collider said: ""I think 'plausible impossibilities' would be a bit easier to swallow if the show hadn’t so firmly established how time passes in Game of Thrones. Jon Snow spent an entire season traveling to and roaming around the area North of the Wall, but in ""Eastwatch"" Tyrion and Davos travel to and from King’s Landing in the span of an entire episode. It’s not that we can’t buy this 'fast travel' bit of storytelling, it's that it feels like cutting corners in contrast to all that came before."" [12] Paste magazine made several articles in reaction. Jim Forel said: ""The show is now hurtling along at such a ridiculous pace that the writers simply can’t keep up and craft simultaneous developments of multiple plotlines that make no sense under the most basic of scrutiny...What we’re criticizing here is poor screenwriting, in the sense that they keep writing characters into situations where the story requires they do things the audience understands are either stupid or impossible."" [13] Shane Ryan said: ""The ridiculous way that characters have seemingly teleported across Westeros this season, appearing thousands of miles away in the blink of an eye, without explanation [is] lazy writing made manifest."" [14] Matt Brennan decried the entire ""Wight Hunt"" invented by the TV writers, and that Daenerys's speedy arrival is only one of several issues with it: ""The problem runs deeper...The episode - stunningly misconceived, bafflingly constructed, shallow, frustrating, long - is its culmination and, one can hope, its nadir. In truth, the plot's temporal and geographical illogic is unsurprising: Game of Thrones has become impatient with the details that sustain one's interest between the stretches of bloodletting"". [15]    On Dragonstone  The TV series has only briefly – and not explicitly – established that Daenerys Targaryen believes she cannot have children again, which was a plot point in the books. In book/Season 1, Mirri Maz Duur performed a blood magic curse which caused Daenerys's baby Rhaego to be stillborn and monstrously deformed. The book version made it more clear that Mirri believed this had done so much damage to Daenerys's womb that she could never have children again; in subsequent books, Daenerys repeatedly reflected in her internal monologue that she considers her three dragons her ""children"" in part because she feels they are the only children she will ever have. In the series, Daenerys mentions her infertility only in ""The Prince of Winterfell"", when stressing to Jorah that she must retrieve her dragons, and in ""The Red Woman"", when Khal Moro says he will lie with her that night and ""if the Great Stallion is kind, you will give me a son."" Daenerys replies: ""I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else. Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east."" Both of these references can be interpreted to mean a choice not to have more children, (if one ignores the non-verbal cues incorporated into Clarke's performance), but this episode makes it explicit that Daenerys has told others she believes she is infertile. The final chapter of the fifth and most current novel hints that Daenerys only believes she can no longer have children, but will recover. In her last chapter, she has been stranded by Drogon back in the Dothraki Sea (corresponding to the Season 5 finale ""Mother's Mercy""), she notes in her inner POV monologue that she has started ""passing blood"" – apparently just thinking she is sick, but there are fan theories that it could actually mean that she has begun Flowering again and her reproductive organs have recovered. It is possible, but totally unconfirmed, that magically resurrected people like Jon Snow or Beric Dondarrion cannot have children – meaning that the bloodline of Daenerys's brother Rhaegar would go extinct as well. In which case, the last blood relative of either of them is actually Gendry – House Baratheon intermarried with the Targaryens, so (in the books) Robert Baratheon's grandmother was a younger Targaryen princess, and thus Robert was actually the second cousin of both Rhaegar and Daenerys. Tyrion even specifically brings up that if Daenerys think she can't have children, she will need to plan for the future of the crown after her eventual death. He brings up that the Night's Watch and the ironborn have their own methods for selecting new rulers without inheritance (elections, a Choosing and a Kingsmoot, respectively). Both are essentially the same, though: they are democratic elections where the citizens vote for their leader (albeit an absolute one), and the majority wins. In the backstory, when there has been no clear successor, a ""Great Council"" is called by all the major lords of the realm to choose the lawful successor. The last major one picked Aegon V Targaryen, as his eldest brother was dead but left behind a mentally handicapped daughter, his second brother was insane and left an infant son behind who many feared inherited his insanity, and his third brother, Aemon, was a maester who had foresworn inheritance. A prior Great Council at the end of the reign of Jaehaerys I Targaryen tried to sort out the succession dispute between the heirs of his first two sons, who had both predeceased him, before settling on Viserys I Targaryen. Prior Great Councils, however, relied on picking between rival heirs, not a situation in which there was no clear lawful blood heir. It is also possible that, once she learns who he is, she might just name Gendry as her heir – reconciling with Robert Baratheon's former supporters. A hint at this might be how the real-life War of the Roses ended, which George R.R. Martin said the War of the Five Kings is loosely inspired by. This was a civil war in Medieval England between the Yorks and Lancasters - i.e. Starks and Lannisters, though the roles are reversed in the fictional story: the Lancasters are considered the “good” faction and the Yorks the ""bad""/cunning faction. The War of the Roses began with the Lancasters being usurpsed by the Yorks (as the Lannisters usurp the Starks & Baratheons), only for the Yorks to ultimately be defeated – Henry Tudor, a bastard descendant of the Lancasters, eventually rallied the kingdom against Yorkist king Richard III and defeated him. Similarly, the Baratheons were seemingly wiped out, but left bastard descendant Gendry behind – perhaps to one day reclaim the throne.  As in the preceding episode, Daenerys and Tyrion heavily reference her intention to ""break the wheel"" of one tyrant replacing another on the Iron Throne, be it Targaryen, Baratheon, or Lannister. This is an invention of the TV series, possibly to present Daenerys as more of an overt hero and/or to appeal to modern audiences who typically view the desirable evolution of any society being toward some form of democracy, and doesn't happen in the novels. In the books, Daenerys sees the Iron Throne as her stolen birthright and wants to reclaim it for House Targaryen and be a good , benevolent monarch, but by the measure of their existing value system, not by radically re-inventing the system.  , benevolent monarch, but by the measure of their existing value system, not by radically re-inventing the system. Tyrion Lannister recalls that, while not a particularly capable or brave physical warrior, he did lead a charge out the Mud Gate – which was during the Battle of the Blackwater.  Winterfell  It is unclear why Arya Stark is behaving the way she does in her scenes with her sister Sansa Stark: she refuses to listen to any of her valid counter-arguments that she wrote the letter to Robb under duress. Arya then outright threatens to kill Sansa and take her face: after launching into a long and uncharacteristically dark threat against Sansa, Arya then simply hands her the Valyrian steel dagger she had been brandishing. If she's worried that Sansa will turn on Jon, threatening her will only exacerbate the problem. Fan speculation is rampant that this is all some elaborate ruse by one or both of the Stark sisters to trick Littlefinger, given that they know he has spies everywhere. Such speculation, however, occurred all too frequently in past seasons to try to explain what turned out to simply be plot holes, inconsistent writing, or simply misinterpretation by fans: i.e. all of the fan theories that Talisa Maegyr's behavior with Robb Stark seemed odd because she was really a Lannister spy. The TV writers later admitted that they rewrote the Robb Stark/Talisa relationship into a romance (which it isn't in the books) primarily for the out-of-universe reason that they wanted to show off Richard Madden (Robb) as an actor. Therefore it is equally possible that Arya is making unusually dark speeches threatening to kill Sansa in this episode, purely because the TV writers wanted to show off Maisie Williams, the actor, chewing the scenery in a dark speech scene.  It might not have been clear why Sansa sent Brienne of Tarth away from Winterfell, right after Littlefinger said she would try to prevent any strife between the Stark sisters. It's possible that Littlefinger wasn't urging that Brienne would prevent Arya from harming Sansa, but that Brienne would protect Arya from Sansa . Thus Sansa sent Brienne away (and burned the letter so no one will know about it) because this is the first step in moving against Arya, before Arya can turn the Northern lords against her. Another possibility is that Sansa was sincere in saying that it was unsafe for Brienne to be in Winterfell with Littlefinger, distrusting Littlefinger when he brought up Brienne and sending her away so that she doesn't serve as another one of his pawns. However, there is a good chance that this was the result Littlefinger hoped for, as it means that the Stark sisters are even more isolated than before. This is consistent with Petyr Baelish's personality. He manuevers people into doing what he wants by relying on lies and half-truths that are combined with vague wording. That allows Petyr to find loopholes if a scheme fails. He claims that the other person misinterpeted his words and phrases. This plan could easily have blown up in his face, however, if Arya had simply and sensibly told her sister what she had seen: that Baelish had asked the Maester to dig up the note. Sansa would surely see his scheming at once. And there is no way Baelish could know Arya well enough to predict she would not simply do that.  from harming Sansa, but that Brienne would protect Arya .

However, there is a good chance that this was the result Littlefinger hoped for, as it means that the Stark sisters are even more isolated than before. Sansa says she fears the Northern lords would think her suspect for marrying into enemy Houses ""twice"" – even though her marriage to Tyrion Lannister in Season 3 was blatantly made under duress while she was literally a prisoner and hostage of the Lannisters in King's Landing. Meanwhile, her marriage to Ramsay Bolton was allegedly part of some bizarre scheme to ""undermine the Boltons from within"" – even though ""Marriage"" doesn't work like that in Westeros, the Lannisters certainly weren't worried about her ""undermining them from within"" when they forced her to marry Tyrion, and even Sansa – when she later confronted Littlefinger in Season 6's ""The Door"" – berated Littlefinger that his plot to marry her to Ramsay didn't really make sense (this doesn't happen in the novels, as the character who marries Ramsey is explicitly stated to be impersonating a Stark to give the Boltons legitimacy). Arya seemingly waves aside Sansa's accurate defense that she wrote the letter to Robb under duress, writing what Cersei told her to write, when she was a frightened 13 year old child told that this was the only way to save her father's life. In Season 1 (""The Pointy End""), Robb and Maester Luwin weren't even angry that Sansa wrote the letter, realizing simply from its contents that while it was in her handwriting she was obviously writing down Cersei's words, and was writing under duress as the Lannisters' prisoner. Many of the Northern lords would probably follow this logic as well. Sansa's concern seems to stem from how quickly the Northern lords rallied to and then abandoned Jon. It seems that she is afraid that tf the letter is made public, then at least some of the lords could accuse Sansa of being House Lannister puppet – not entirely a stretch given how disgruntled some of them are getting, and problematic even if Sansa isn't making a power grab for herself. Sansa's response to Petyr Baelish's analysis of the situation was that she considered his views without becoming emotional.  in Westeros, the Lannisters certainly weren't worried about her ""undermining them from within"" when they forced her to marry Tyrion, and even Sansa – when she later confronted Littlefinger in Season 6's ""The Door"" – berated Littlefinger that his plot to marry her to Ramsay didn't really make sense (this doesn't happen in the novels, as the character who marries Ramsey is explicitly stated to be impersonating a Stark to give the Boltons legitimacy). It is somewhat strange that Arya does not mention how Sansa behaved when she and Joffrey encountered Arya and Mycah (""The Kingsroad""): all Sansa cared about was ""her beloved Joffrey"", as if he was the innocent victim rather than the bully, and did not care at all that he maliciously injured an innocent harmless kid, without provocation, and then nearly killed her sister; moreover, afterwards she lied brazenly about the incident. Arya has a good reason to resent Sansa for her awful behavior, and to bring it up among her other accusations against Sansa.  In the first novel, Sansa performed an act that perhaps could be considered as a betrayal against her house - of her own free will, without any coercion: her father told her he intended to send her and Arya back to Winterfell; Sansa could not bear the thought of being sent away from ""her beloved Joffrey"", so she told that to Cersei. In the second novel, Cersei claimed that Ned's plan was foiled thanks to Sansa's warning. Actually, that act had little to do with Ned's downfall, since he revealed to Cersei that he learned the truth about her children, and then put his trust in Littlefinger; that double stupidity resulted in Ned's imprisonment and subsequent death. Arya had no idea about Sansa's aforementioned act (which was omitted from the show anyway).  Arya reveals to Sansa for the first time that she was actually watching their father's execution, in Season 1's ""Baelor"", as she was hiding in the crowd in front of the Great Sept. It seems bizarre that Arya accuses Sansa of being there willingly given that Sansa broke into screaming when Joffrey declared he would kill Ned, and then outright fainted when he was beheaded. However, Arya – who wasn't even a teenager yet – didn't actually see Sansa faint: Yoren was holding her tight and she had already abandoned the vantage point that let her see above the crowd. When Sansa accused Arya of inaction when their father was condemned to death, Arya doesn't mention how she jumped down from the base of Baelor's statue and fought through the crowd, trying to get to her father, and was only restrained by Yoren who, at Ned Stark's bidding, rushed over to protect her, shield her eyes from his execution, and get her out of King's Landing.  Arya recalls their father Eddard Stark watching from the catwalk while the boys practiced archery in the courtyard, then she practiced when the boys left but had to try many times to hit the target. While this is similar to the Stark family's first scene in the Season 1 premiere ""Winter is Coming"", it must be describing something that happened earlier: in that episode, Arya fired one arrow and hit the target, while her parents and the boys were still there. Arya says that Sansa didn't really watch the archery practice sessions because she was at the sewing circle with Septa Mordane, whom Joffrey executed along with the rest of Ned's household servants in King's Landing at the end of Season 1. In the Season 1 premiere, Arya snuck away from the sewing circle with Sansa and Mordane to watch the archery practice. In the novels, Arya actually isn't skilled at archery; in fact, she has not shot even one arrow in the novels. Fans have pointed out that her scene in Season 1 scoring a bull's eye on her target when Bran failed to contradicted this, as she isn't a preternaturally skilled archer with no training. This episode retroactively explains that she was simply practicing in secret for some time before that.  One of the faces Arya has created as magic Faceless Men shapeshifter masks is clearly the face of Walder Frey. It is unknown who the other faces are from.  The Inside the Episode video points out an additional reason for Sansa's shock when Arya starts speaking behind her, after she discovers her bag of faces: notice the camera clearly showed Sansa closing the only door into the room, but when the camera pulls back to reveal Arya, the door is still shut. Arya entered the room, and then closed the door behind her, so silently that Sansa didn't even notice despite only being a few feet away.  door into the room, but when the camera pulls back to reveal Arya, the door is shut. Arya entered the room, and then closed the door behind her, so silently that Sansa didn't even notice despite only being a few feet away. Arya accuses Sansa that Lyanna Mormont is ""younger than you were"" when Cersei forced her to write the letter begging Robb to surrender, in exchange for their father's life. The passage of time between Seasons 6 and 7 is somewhat unclear, as is Lyanna Mormont's age. She was stated to be 10 years old in Season 5, but then described as 10 years old again in Season 6, even though other story elements seem to indicate that around a year passed between those seasons – it's possible that they were rounding, or that this was simply a dialogue error (repeating the line about her age without the TV writers taking the passage of time into account). Lyanna should have been 11 years old in Season 6, and at most 12 years old in Season 7 (assuming that one year passes each season, a pattern which generally held in prior seasons – but for all we know Season 7 might simply break with this and happen in a shorter timeframe). The matter is moot, however, because Sansa was stated in dialogue to be 13 years old in Season 1 – so whichever scenario, Lyanna is at most 12 years old now, and thus still ""younger"" than Sansa was.  Also regarding the passage of time, Sansa makes the only comment ever to address this in Season 7 itself, but only by vaguely saying that it has been ""weeks"" since Jon left Winterfell for Dragonstone. Given that months are composed of weeks, this could refer to anything from four weeks to four months – the TV writers may have been deliberately ambiguous about this.  Sansa says that they're asking ""20,000 men"" to fight for them. This doesn't seem to match prior numbers and is likely a hyperbolic remark or miscalculation on Sansa's part: earlier this season, Jon said there were fewer than 10,000 soldiers left in the North – though he was possibly referring to just the soldiers raised in the North itself, and not the large army from the Vale that came to Winterfell. Given that the Vale stayed neutral for most of the War of the Five Kings, until heading to Winterfell to help defeat the Boltons, it should have a full strength army in the range of 20-30,000 men (i.e. Robb could raise 20,000 men from the North in Season 1 when their armies were fresh, Tywin could raise even more in the south, etc.).  Arya suggests Sansa to play the game of faces - the game she used to play with the Waif (""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"").  The Wight Hunt - Jon's group heading north, and back  The Wight Hunt – the battle  The initial skirmish with a scouting party explicitly reveals that the White Walkers and their undead horde are a keystone army: if a White Walker dies, any wights that it has personally reanimated will drop dead, the White Walker's magic no longer animating them. Assuming this effect filters throughout all ranks of the army, it would mean that if the Night King were to be killed, all the White Walkers he turned, and all subsequent Wights, would be killed, effectively annihilating the entire horde of the undead with a single blow. This hasn't been revealed yet in the novels – if it is even true in the novels – and may in fact be a massive, TV-first revelation.  The showrunners stated in the Inside the Episode video for the preceding episode that the Wight Hunt is ""an idea we came up with"" – in a context that almost assuredly means it won't actually happen in the next novel, but is an invention of the TV series. Similarly, in the Inside the Episode video for this episode itself, producer D.B. Weiss remarks on how they came up with the idea that Jon's search party gets trapped in the middle of a frozen lake - that they had to come up with this idea, it isn't based on something Martin told them about what happens in the next novel.  had to come up with this idea, it isn't based on something Martin told them about what happens in the next novel. Similarly, the climaxes for Seasons 5 and 6 – ""Hardhome"" and ""Battle of the Bastards"" – are large action sequences heavily featuring Kit Harington, but which probably won't actually happen in the novels. ""Hardhome"" certainly won't happen: Jon doesn't go to Hardhome in the current novels, and while an expedition was sent there, it won't involve him and will apparently happen off-screen. There is no guarantee that Jon will actually fight Ramsay Bolton in a future novel (anymore than it seemed that Robb Stark would face off against Joffrey Baratheon, but then didn't). It is entirely possible that Stannis Baratheon will defeat the Boltons in his upcoming battle against him, and that Theon Greyjoy may execute Ramsay (or they might all die, no one knows for sure). In the Blu-ray commentary and behind the scenes videos for these first two battles, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss frequently remark that after the Battle of Castle Black, they were so impressed that actor Kit Harington can do his own stuntwork with swords that they wanted to show it off again, and remark on how impressed they are with how much emotion Harington can convey with his non-verbal facial reactions. Weiss even boasts in the behind the scenes video for ""Battle of the Bastards"" that ""It's got minimal dialogue in it!"". The battle scene, before Daenerys arrives, even uses a slow-motion shot to focus on Jon Snow, as Kit Harington reacts in wordless horror to the waves of wights overwhelming them. The showrunners have previously said in numerous videos that they avoid using slow motion whenever possible, feeling that it is a cheap trick, and have only sparingly used it a few times to convey extreme emotion during a battle (i.e. Jon focusing on Ygritte dying so much during the Battle of Castle Black that the camera slows down to shift to his perception, a slow-motion shot of Jaime watching men on fire flee Daenerys's dragon, which otherwise would happen too fast for the audience to experience as he does, etc.).  The entire battle scene, from when the wights start crossing the frozen lake to when Jon is saved by Benjen, lasts a full 9 minutes with no significant dialogue (other than shouts of ""Help!"", ""Fall back!"", etc.), instead focusing on the non-verbal reactions of the cast. After the battle begins, but before Daenerys arrives, consist of 5 full minutes of just Jon's party circled up and defending themselves from waves after wave of undead wights, with no dialogue – in contrast with the Massacre at Hardhome or Battle of the Bastards, which had more dialogue interspersed throughout, and incremental phases to each part of their battle sequences (i.e. at Hardhome, Jon tries to run into a building to retrieve dragonglass daggers, fails, then faces a White Walker, then new waves of wights appear).  Benjen Stark dies for the last time, torn apart by wights, holding them off so his nephew Jon could escape on his horse. It is still unclear in the books what happened to Benjen, as he has not returned yet: the TV producers refer to him now as ""Coldhands Benjen"". In the books, ""Coldhands"" is a character who has similarly been reanimated but kept his own mind and free will due to the magic of the Children of the Forest, who helps Samwell Tarly and Bran Stark; he is definitely not a wight, since he can talk and his eyes are not glowing blue. There are three possibilities: either ""Coldhands"" really is Benjen, or perhaps Coldhands is a separate character setting up that Benjen will be reanimated in similar fashion, or this is just a pure invention of the TV series – it is currently unknown. When asked by his editor if Coldhands was Benjen, George R.R. Martin simply answered with a written message: ""NO"".  The wights' apparent aversion to water appears for the second time in this episode, the first being ""Hardhome"", where none of the Wights would chase Jon Snow or the Wildlings into the water. This is repeated again in this episode, when none of the Wights would initially chase the party into the lake after the ice cracks. In the novels, the Wights have no aversion to water: one of Cottor Pyke's letters to Jon Snow from the expedition to Hardhome states that there are "" dead things in the water ."" This episode, however, shows that water doesn't kill wights: when Tormund is swarmed by wights, two wights burst out of the frozen lake and try to drag Tormund under. One possibility that could simply be that wights can in fact operate in water, they simply cannot float or swim in it: when the dragons attack the wights and melt the ice, there is a shot that depicts dozens of wights sinking to the bottom of the lake. Furthermore, given the ending shot depicting the wights dragging Viserion's corpse out of the lake, it can be presumed some wights entered the water in order to attach the chains to the dragon's corpse.  ."" This episode, however, shows that water doesn't kill wights: when Tormund is swarmed by wights, two wights burst of the frozen lake and try to drag Tormund under.

Furthermore, given the ending shot depicting the wights dragging Viserion's corpse out of the lake, it can be presumed wights entered the water in order to attach the chains to the dragon's corpse. This episode of course marks the first time that a dragon has died on-screen, Viserion the white dragon(Viserion isn't white on the show, instead golden in color). Dragons are nearly impervious to conventional weapons – but even in the backstory of the books, they have never been tested against Magic powers and weapons, like those of the White Walkers.  It is unclear why the Night King decided to throw an ice spear at Viserion, as opposed to Drogon, who was far closer and not airborne - and also evacuating the humans whose escape he was trying to prevent. It's possible he considered Viserion the more immediate threat because he was still actively attacking the White Walkers' army. He may also have considered that Drogon would have taken some time to take off anyway, making him still a potential target after killing Viserion, while Viserion and Rhaegal could have immediately left should Drogon had been killed first, being already in flight.  The weapons that the White Walkers wield, such as the ice-spear that the Night King uses to kill Viserion, are White Walker ice blades (they don't have a formal name). The books describe them as razor-thin shards of ice crystals, sharper than any human blade could ever be. George R.R. Martin has stated that they are made of ""ice"" - though only in the same sense that Valyrian steel is technically ""made out of iron"". Both are infused with spells that give them magical powers far beyond that: as Martin said, the White Walkers ""can do things with ice we can't imagine"".  In a subsequent interview, Emilia Clarke herself points out the irony that out of the three dragons, Viserion was the dragon who was killed and turned into a wight - given that he was named after Viserys, Daenerys's cruel brother who was brutally killed in Season 1 by Khal Drogo.  Given that the showrunners admitted that the Wight Hunt is an invention of the TV series, this introduces a massive and unresolved question: would the showrunners totally invent something on the scale of killing one of Daenerys's three dragons? Or, will Viserion be killed by the White Walkers in the novels, but in different circumstances? Or be killed by something else, or not at all? Such answers will, unfortunately, only be provided in the release of the next A Song of Ice and Fire novels.

"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her “longtime” tour promoter told Billboard, “By the time all the tickets are sold next week, I’ll be celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.” But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post’s headline, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,” is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company’s “Verified Fan” program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents’ credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could “improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets.” And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  “I paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,” one fan wrote. “Now for the same seats I have to pay about $500.”  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry’s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.",0

"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Yesterday, multiple outlets reported that Brad Pitt is under investigation for child abuse by both the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services after an incident that occurred on his family’s private plane last Wednesday. More details have emerged about the incident that reportedly caused Angelina Jolie to file for divorce and request full custody of the couple’s six children. Us Weekly is reporting that at least part of the alleged fight was caught on film, and TMZ and People are reporting that the fight involved Pitt and Jolie’s 15-year-old son, Maddox.  According to TMZ, “the details of precisely what happened” are “murky,” but the anonymous person who reported Pitt to the DCFS alleged that Pitt “attacked” Maddox on the family’s flight home from Nice, France. From TMZ:  Here’s what’s alleged – shortly after the plane took off, Brad and Angelina began arguing and Maddox jumped up to verbally defend his mom. We’re told Brad then lunged at the boy and Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband. Brad connected in some fashion with his son.  People, which has presented Pitt’s side of the divorce story throughout the week, reports that Pitt “did not hit” Maddox during the incident. A source close to Pitt provided People with the following account:  Pitt “was drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,” says the source. “There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.”    The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. “He is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was spiraling out of control.”    A source close to Pitt says any accusations beyond that are “a combination of exaggerations and lies. They have taken the overall smallest kernel of truth – that a fight got out of hand and reached a regrettable peak, and that as a result DCFS is looking into it – and they are manipulating it to best suit their attempts to gain custody.”  Lainey Lui of Lainey Gossip points out that, at some point last night, People removed the following sentence from the report: “The Pitt source adds that the star ‘was not black-out drunk’ and that ‘he absolutely remembers that evening and has been interviewed at length to that effect.’”  TMZ notes that Pitt’s sources and Jolie’s sources do not agree on whether or not Pitt was drunk during the incident, so that point remains unclear. TMZ reported yesterday that sometime after the incident, the plane landed in Minnesota to refuel, and “that’s when eyewitnesses say Brad was ‘out of control’ on the tarmac and even tried to leave in a fuel truck.”  Pitt has yet to release an official statement regarding the allegations. Us Weekly reports that, on the video of the incident, Pitt can be seen “looking drunk” and “yelling.” Us Weekly’s source claims, however, that “nothing physical” happens on the tape.  According to TMZ, Pitt still plans to fight for joint custody of his children.  We will update this post as more information becomes available.",1

"[Spoilers: This story contains full spoilers for season two of Netflix's Stranger Things.]  Goonies never say die ... except when they do.  In the penultimate installment of the second season of Stranger Things, the life-threatening stakes facing the denizens of Hawkins, Indiana, finally make their full impact known, by killing off one of the beloved main characters — a newbie, sure, but beloved all the same: Bob Newby (Sean Astin). Newby is, in fact, the goodhearted and ultimately ill-fated boyfriend of Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), and was savagely killed by a pack of demodogs in full view of Joyce, Sheriff Hopper (David Harbour) and even the young party of friends once again caught in the thick of battle against the Upside Down.  ""That was a tough one,"" says Caleb McLaughlin, who plays Lucas Sinclair, on the subject of losing Astin from the show. ""He was so desperate to survive. And when Winona [as Joyce] watches it happen and she's crying? It was a really good scene. I cried.""  ""We all loved him,"" adds Noah Schnapp, who worked closely with Astin, thanks to Bob's role as a hopeful father figure to Will. ""He was like a kid. He was hilarious. I remember we were all with Winona, protesting to keep him on set and not have him get killed off. He was the best! He did get a really good kill scene, so that's pretty good. When I was watching it, I liked those scenes where you don't expect it. When I was watching, as an audience, you really don't expect it. It comes out of nowhere.""  According to creators the Duffer Brothers, it was always part of the plan to kill off Bob, even if some of the circumstances changed along the way — including the fact that Bob wasn't always the most likable character.  ""He wasn't supposed to be that big of a character, and he was supposed to die a lot earlier,"" says Matt Duffer. ""Then we found Sean Astin and met him and fell in love with this guy as a person and as an actor. We really started to fall in love with his character.""  According to executive producer Shawn Levy, there was initially some reluctance in hiring Astin as Bob, since The Goonies was already such an influence on season two: ""When Sean Astin read this role, it was so immediately compelling. He got the part because he's a rad actor, not because he's the guy from Goonies. If anything, that gave us pause because we knew people would assume it was due to that linkage, but it's just because he gave an incredible audition.""  During the course of the season, the Duffers started falling for Astin's performance as the hapless Bob Newby, once the head of the Hawkins Middle School audio/visual club when he was a kid, known by Hopper and others behind his back as ""Bob the Brain."" In his scenes with Joyce, Bob was frequently tickled with surprise over ending up with her all these years later, considering the different lives they led when they were kids. That star-crossed backstory only makes it more upsetting when the Radio Shack employee is ripped into by demodogs, defenseless due to having left one of Hopper's firearms behind elsewhere in Hawkins Lab.  ""Bob wasn't designed to be the likable character who perishes; he was designed to be kind of just an out-of-it dork,"" says Matt Duffer, in terms of how Bob was written. ""Sean Astin really transformed that role, to the point where we kept kicking his death down the road. We kept pushing it and pushing it until we could push it no further — when we got to episode eight and we realized narratively we still had to do it. It was the hardest scene to write all year, just because it was hard to lose that character and lose Sean. We had such a great time working with him.""  Describing Bob's death as season two's ""central heartbreaker,"" Levy thinks the fatal moment serves to fuel the stakes heading into the finale: ""It's an example of really what I hope season two succeeds at — a big emotional idea, told in a really ambitious and cinematic way. That's really what we're going with always for this series. Both seasons have a slower burn from everyday life and a desire for normalcy devolving into crazy-ass stuff, forcing heroism among our characters. That was the arc of season one and that was the arc of season two. Bob's death in the last third of season two was always a big pivot point to be our ramp into the finale action.""  Ironically enough, Bob dies shortly before justice for Barb (Shannon Purser) is finally achieved, thanks to Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton). Can we expect fans to take up arms with ""Justice for Bob,"" heading into season three? The Duffers aren't so sure: ""I don't think you can ever re-create whatever happened with Barb."" Newby nation, I believe that's your cue.  Follow THR.com/StrangerThings for all of our continuing season two coverage.",0
"In an interview with an Australian news outlet on Friday, Lorde made comments some interpreted as suggesting she was on the outs with Taylor Swift. Now, the New Zealand pop star has tweeted a statement clarifying that that’s not the case.  “Taylor is a dear friend,” she wrote. “I love her very much. … Really sh–ty to wake up to headlines about whether or not you’ve jumped ship on someone you deeply respect and ride for. I want to say one more time that Taylor has been there for me in all my dark and light moments these past five years. All of them.”  Lorde did, however, take the opportunity to elaborate on the initial quote she gave in her interview, where she seemed to say that she doesn’t hang out much with the famous friends she’s made in recent years and isn’t “calling [her] idols” for advice.  For one, Lorde noted that while some had thought she was referencing Swift as an “idol,” she was really just referring to David Bowie and Patti Smith, who she’d mentioned earlier in the interview.  She also expounded on the flaws of describing Swift’s group of friends as a “squad.” “I’ve always found people’s perception of this ‘squad’ idea frustrating in the past,” she wrote. “It was never some exclusive club or secret society, but a wide circle of people, some of whom I know, and some who I’ve never met, like most wide groups of friends. Forgive me for the mild eyeroll I popped when it was brought up as if we’re all blood members of a secret cult.”  Of course, Lorde — whose second album, Melodrama, debuted at the top of Billboard’s albums chart last month — brushed the whole thing off. “I f—ed up an interview question,” she concluded. “Now go sip a beverage and head out on a walk.” See her complete note below.",0

"This is a transcript of the interview ABC News’ chief anchor George Stephanopoulos conducted with President Barack Obama on November 12, 2015 at the White House.STEPHANOPOULOS: Okay, Mr. President, thank you for doing this.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Great to be here, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about ISIS to begin with. Did they bring down that Russian plane?OBAMA: Well, we don't know that yet. It is a possibilitySTEPHANOPOULOS: Just a possibility?OBAMA: Well, we don't know. I think we're still looking at all the details. Any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work. It becomes more difficult when we're not actively involved on the ground. We are offering full cooperation with the Egyptians, with the Russians and others. But a lot of this is peace work. But there's a possibility that they may have taken place.STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of the intelligence community seems to think it's more of a probability. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence Committee thinks it is. And he told me last week that this would mean that ISIS has fully eclipsed Al Qaeda as the greatest terror threat in the world. Is that right?OBAMA: Well, number one, I think it's premature, but it is a possibility. Number two, what we've known for a long time, since the duration of my presidency and before that, is that a small network of people if they've got some skills and bomb making capabilities can carry out some big damage.And this is why we have ramped up our aviation security not just here in the United States but overseas. If there's a carrier coming here, then we're working with that airlines and that airport to make sure that they've got certain procedures. Now, we don't fly directly over the Sinai to the United States, and as a consequence we don't have those same arrangements at those airports.But this is something that we have known is a consistent vulnerability in this modern era. And that's part of the reason why we invest so much in not only putting safeguards in place but also learning each time there's an incident like this to see how this might have happened.STEPHANOPOULOS: But if ISIS with affiliates in so many countries right now, even Afghanistan, if they decided now to go to international terror, that's a game changer, isn't it?OBAMA: Well I have to tell you, George AQAP in Yemen Al Qaeda in Yemen we know has had plots consistently over the last several years to try to bring down an airliner. I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel. If there's a crack in the system, then they potentially can exploit it. And they are looking for these cracks to exploit.What makes ISIL the challenge that it is right now is primarily the fact that they're occupying territory in two countries that aren't governed effectively in those spaces. All right, so in Iraq, when you get into the Sunni areas of Iraq there's not strong governance. In Syria, obvious in the midst of civil war, there is a total breakdown of order. And their ability to sustain themselves in those areas are the primary and principle concern we have.STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think it meansOBAMA: with respect to ISIL.STEPHANOPOULOS: that Vladimir Putin will start to take them on?OBAMA: Well Putin, I think, from the start has been sincere in seeing ISIL as a threat. The reason he went into Syria is not primarily because of ISIL, but to prop up Assad. And part of our goal is to underscore for him and for everyone in the region that ISIL is the primary threat and you can't solve the ISIL problem if, in fact, you've got a country that is governed by somebody who's illegitimate and that the majority of Syrians reject.STEPHANOPOULOS: Big meeting this weekend. Can you convince him?OBAMA: What's interesting is we've already seen I think a growing awareness on the part of the Russians after several weeks now of fairly high paced bombing that they're not going to win this militarily. I think they understand that. They may not admit it publicly, but you're already starting to see indications of that.And it is a modestly positive sign that they've engaged with us, the Saudis the Turks and others to try to broker a political transition plan. Now, they have not yet come to the conclusion that Assad can't be part of a new Syria. And I think it's going to take some time for them to get there. But our goal here, and John Kerry, I think's, done outstanding work in starting to create a platform and a set of principles whereby we agree that a political s solution is what's required, that it has to be inclusive, that there's going to be a transition phase.And, by bringing in the Iranians and the Russians, which is tough for us and tough for a number of our coalition allies they're now at the table. We're starting to shape who are the groups that could responsibly govern Syria. And if we can keep pushing on that diplomatic track even as we're squeezing ISIL in places like the Sinjar operation that's currently taking place then what you see over the course of the next year is I think the possibility that our 60-member coalition and the approach that we're taking is one that Russia determines(OVERTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: But the coalition hasn't all stepped up. And some of your critics say, even your friendly critics say, like Fareed Zakaria, that what you have on the ground now is not going to be enough. Every couple of months you're going to be faced with the same choice of back down or double down.OBAMA: I think what is true is that this has always been a multi-year project precisely because the governance structures in the Sunni areas of Iraq are weak, and there are none in Syria. And we don't have ground forces there in in sufficient numbers so simply march into Al-Raqqah in Syria and clean the whole place out. And as a consequence, we've always understood that our goal has to be militarily constraining ISIL's capabilities, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing at the same time as we're putting a political track together in Syria and fortifying the best impulses in Baghdad so that we can, not just win militarily, but also win by improving governance(OVERTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: And that's the strategy you've been following. But ISIS is gaining strength, aren't they?OBAMA: Well, no, I don't think they're gaining strength. What is true is that from the start our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them. They have not gained ground in Iraq. And in Syria it they'll come in, they'll leave. But you don't see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain.What we have not yet been able to do is to completely decapitate their command and control structures. We've made some progress in trying to reduce the flow of foreign fighters. But one of the things that I'll be talking about when I see President Erdogan in Turkey and discuss this with the G20 is that we've still got to do more work in controlling the border so that the influx of foreign fighters is much more reduced.And you know, what we also have to do is frankly work with the Iraqis to strengthen their capabilities. Because one of the big challenges throughout this campaign has been that the Iraqi military has proven itself to be effective in protecting Baghdad. But it's much harder for them, because they're primarily Shia, to move out into Sunni areas. And part of our goal has to be to recruit more effective Sunni partners in Iraq to really go on offense rather than simply engage in defense.STEPHANOPOULOS: So what do you think when you hear someone like Ben Carson get up in a debate and say, ""Hey, this would be easy. We can take ISIL out just by bombing their oil fields in Anbar,"" that's what a general told him.OBAMA: Yeah. What I think is that he doesn't know much about it. And look George, I think it's fair to say that over the last several years I've had access to all the best military minds in the country and all the best foreign policy minds in the country. And I'm not running for office. And so my only interest is in success.And if I'm down in the Situation Room talking with people who have worked in these regions and have run major military operations from the chairman of my joint chiefs of staff Joe Dunford to, you know, individuals like General Allen, who was involved in Iraqi operations back in 2007/2008, and they don't think it's easy, then it's probably not easy.And what we've been able to do is to shape a strategy that first and foremost contained the momentum that ISIL had gained. We are now in a position where slowly, incrementally we're pushing back against areas where we know we've got some solid partners like the Kurds and the Peshmerga. But until we get the Syria political situation resolved and until Assad is no longer a lightning rod for Sunnis in Syria and the that entire region is not longer a proxy war for Shia/Sunni conflict we're going to continue to have problemsSTEPHANOPOULOS: That could take a generation.OBAMA: Well I would distinguish between making sure that the place is perfect. That's not going to happen anytime soon with making sure that ISIL continues to shrink in its scope of operations until it no longer poses the kind of threat that it does, not just primarily to us, but to neighbors in the region like Jordan or Saudi Arabia and that the humanitarian crisis that's taking place with millions of people who are fleeing the country that that can be relieved.STEPHANOPOULOS: You're not running for office. But as you know, the Republican candidates are putting your foreign policy on the ballot. They say the Obama/Clinton legacy is a more dangerous world because you're weak and America has failed to lead. If you were up on that stage, how would you respond?OBAMA: Well, what I would say is that America is not weaker; it's stronger around the world than when I came into office. And that can be measured by the influence that we have on a whole range of transnational issues, the cooperation that we get on not just counterterrorism, but on critical issues like climate change the work that we're doing in Asia that I'll be traveling to talk about in terms of creating the kinds of rule based systems that preserve our freedom of navigation and try to push back against Chinese efforts that may threaten the peace and prosperity of the region.You know, there was a lot of talk among these Republicans about the success of Putin's strategy in the Ukraine. But in fact, because we were able to mobilize the entire international community, we've been able to you know, not only reduce the fighting in Ukraine, but now we're still on track to potentially resolve that peacefully. So you know, one of the things that's striking to me, George, is that pub public opinion around the world about the United States is significantly higher than it was when I came into office.We have not seen the kinds of big threats against the United States that sadly we saw during something like 9/11. We've been able to take more than 180,000 troops or 150, 60, 70,000 troops out of harm's way while still maintaining coalition partnerships. And in everywhere from Latin America to Africa we helped to shape the agenda for a more peaceful, prosperous world. So when you hear rhetoric like this, George, about America's never been in greater danger that's rhetoric. That's campaign talk.STEPHANOPOULOS: But when you think about it, when you reflect on it, where have you fallen short? You didn't expect to have several thousand troops in Afghanistan, more than 3,500 troops in Iraq.OBAMA: Well, I think actually in Afghanistan let's take Afghanistan as an example. I don't think any of us were ever under any illusion that we could withdraw every single troop out of Afghanistan and that country, which is one of the poorest in the world, that has gone through 30 or 40 year so fighting would be completely stable.Our very premise, our strategy was always that we were going to have to provide the kinds of advice the kinds of training, the kinds of military support that would be required so that this nascent democracy began to work. And that's exactly what we're doing. I when I consider where we have fallen short, what is absolutely true is that in the Middle East and in Syria in particular the you know, enormous changes that took place post Arab Spring were ones that don't happen, you know, every ten years. They happen every 50, 60, 70 years. And we have not been able to get the kind of success on the ground with countries that were fragile to begin with that were governed by dictators to create the kind of civil society that would allow for a functioning, if not perfectly democratic, then at least civil society and government.And you know, that's humbling. But it's hard. And when you hear the Republicans talk about well, you know, we'd go in and fix this right away. We're going to win in Middle East. What's clear is that you don't have any sense of how difficult it is. And they don't have a lot of sense of history, including the recent history of our efforts in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.STEPHANOPOULOS: Lot of talk about immigration as well. Donald Trump is speaking about history. He wants to bring back Operation Wetback from President Eisenhower and deportation force. What would that mean?OBAMA: Well, I think the name of the operation tells you something about the dangers of looking backwards. And the notion that we're going to deport 11, 12 million people from this country, first of all I have no idea where Mr. Trump thinks the money's going to come from. It would cost us hundreds of billions of dollars to execute that. Imagine the images on the screen flashed around the world as we were dragging parents away from their children and putting them in what, detention centers and then systematically sending them out. Nobody thinks that that is realistic, but more importantly, that's not who we are as Americans.STEPHANOPOULOS: What do you think when you hear people cheer for that?OBAMA: Well, what I think is that there's always been a strain of anti-immigrant sentiment in America, ironically from folks who themselves two generations back or even one generation back were immigrants themselves. And it's the job of leaders not to play into that sentiment. Now, those sentiments get stronger when people feel insecure.And given what happened in 2007, 2008, given the fact that despite the recovery, I think people still have some post-traumatic stress and are still concerned about prospects for jobs and economic security in the future it's easy to play on those fears. But that's not that's not what you want from your president.And to their credit Republican and as well as Democratic senators and or presidents in the past, including Ronald Reagan, including George H.W. Bush, including George W. Bush have understood that we are a nation of laws, but we're also a nation of immigrants and that proposing radical and necessarily cruel solutions to a problem that can be solved by some good, old-fashioned legislation of the sort that passed on a bipartisan basis in the Senate and I would've been able to sign two years ago if the House Republicans had allowed it to come to the floor 'cause there was a majority on that floor to vote for it we don't want I think, a president or any person in a position of leadership to play on those kinds of fears.STEPHANOPOULOS: You say we're a nation of laws. On the issue of Guantanamo, one of your big promises, closing Guantanamo Speaker Ryan says you can't close it on your own, don't have the authority. He says the law is the law. Do you have the authority to close it on your own?OBAMA: Well, here's what I know is that we need to close it. That's not just my opinion. If you take a survey of retired generals folks who are currently in uniform they will tell you that this is a consistent recruitment tool for jihadists. It is contrary to our values. It costs huge amounts of money. And it's not sustainableOBAMA: so it is my--STEPHANOPOULOS: did on your own.OBAMA: So it is my job to, first and foremost, work with Congress to try to find a solution. And what we've been able to do during the course of this administration is to systematically transfer and draw down the numbers who are there. My hope is that by the end of this year we are seeing close to under 100 prisoners remaining and detainees remaining. And then my intention is to present to Congress a sensible, plausible plan that will meet our national security needs and be consistent with who areSTEPHANOPOULOS: And when they say no?OBAMA: Well they I'm not going to one of the things that I've been consistently trying to do is to give Congress the chance to do the right thing before I then look at my next options. And Congress is going to have an opportunity, I think when they look at the numbers, when they look at how much it costs for us to detain these individuals, when they hear from both current and retired military officers who say this is not what we should be doing they're going to have the ability to make their own assumptions.STEPHANOPOULOS: So you're not ruling out doing it on your own?OBAMA: My job right now is to make sure that Congress has a chance to look at a serious plan and look at all the facts and we'll take it from there.STEPHANOPOULOS: Will you rule out executive action?OBAMA: We'll take it from there.STEPHANOPOULOS: You've called Hillary Clinton a good friend, strong friend, one of America's finest secretaries of state and said she'd make a great president. So is it fair for Democrats to conclude she's your candidate?OBAMA: (LAUGH) George, I'm not going to make endorsements when, you know, I've said in the past it's important for the process to play itself out. I think Dem I think Hillary's doing great. I think, you know, Bernie Sanders is really adding to this debate--STEPHANOPOULOS: Would he make a great president?OBAMA: -- in a very serious way. You know, I think Bernie is capturing a sense among the American people that they want to know the government's on their side, that it's not bought and paid for, that you know, our focus has to be on hard working, middle class Americans not getting' a raw deal. And I think that is in in incredibly important. I think Martin O'Malley has important things to say. So we'll let this process play out. I am confident that we're going to have a good, strong Democratic candidate, and that they'll be able to win in November.STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally-- when you were a student, you spoke out, you protested apartheid in South Africa. If you were on the campus of University of Missouri today, would you be a protestor?OBAMA: (SIGH) Without knowing all the facts I've read enough to know that there is clearly a problem at-- the University of Missouri. And, that's not just coming from students. That's coming from some faculty. And I think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest-- what they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst. I want-- an activist student body just like I want an activist citizenry. And-- the issue is just making sure that-- even as these young people are getting engaged, getting involved, speaking out-- that they're also listening. And, you know I'd rather see them err on the side of activism than being passive. I think that what you saw with the University of Missouri football team, and the coach, you know, standing up for something that they think is right-- harkens back to a powerful tradition that helped to bring about great change in this country. But I also want to make sure that they understand that being a good citizen being an activist involves hearing the other side--STEPHANOPOULOS: See, that's what I wanted to ask you (CROSSTALK)OBAMA: --and making sure that you are engaging in a dialogue, because that's also how change happens. The civil rights movement happened because there was civil disobedience, because people were willing to get to go to jail, because there were events like Bloody Sunday. But it was also because the leadership of the movement consistently stayed open to the possibility of reconciliation and sought to understand the views even views that were appalling to them of the other side.STEPHANOPOULOS: Because there does seem to be a strain on some of these campuses of a kind of militant political correctness where you shut down the other side.OBAMA: And I disagree with that. And, it's interesting. You know, I've now got, you know, daughters who-- one is about to go to college-- the other one's-- you know, going to be on her way in a few years. And then we talk about this at the dinner table.And I say to them, ""Listen, if you hear somebody using a racial epithet, if you hear somebody who's anti-Semitic, if you see an injustice, I want you to speak out. And I want you to be firm and clear and I want you to protect people who may not have voices themselves. I want you to be somebody who's strong and sees themselves as somebody who's looking out for the vulnerable.""But I tell 'em-- ""I want you also to be able to listen. I don't want you to think that a display of your strength is simply shutting other people up. And that part of your ability to bring about change is going to be by engagement and understanding the viewpoints and the arguments of the other side."" And so when I hear, for example, you know, folks on college campuses saying, ""We're not going to allow somebody to speak on our campus because we disagree with their ideas or we feel threatened by their ideas--"" you know, I think that's a recipe for dogmatism. And I think you're not going to be as effective. And so, but I want to be clear here 'cause, and it's a tough issue because, you know, there are two values that I care about.I care about civil rights and I care about kids not being discriminated against or having swastikas painted on their doors or nooses hung-- thinking it's a joke. I think it's entirely appropriate for-- any institution, including universities, to say, ""Don't walk around in black face. It offends people. Don't wear a headdress and beat your chest if Native American students have said, you know, 'This hurts us. This bothers us."" There's nothing wrong with that.But we also have these values of free speech. And it's not free speech in the abstract. The purpose of that kind of free speech is to make sure that we are forced to use argument and reason and words in making our democracy work. And you know, the you don't have to be fearful of somebody spouting bad ideas. Just out-argue 'em, beat 'em.Make the case as to why they're wrong. Win over adherents. That's how-- that's how things work in-- in-- in a democracy. And I do worry if young people start getting trained to think that if somebody says something I don't like if somebody says something that hurts my feelings that my only recourse is to shut them up, avoid them, push them away, call on a higher power to protect me from that. You know, and yes, does that put more of a burden on minority students or gay students or Jewish students or others in a majority that may be blind to history and blind to their hurt? It may put a slightly higher burden on them.But you're not going to make the kinds of deep changes in society-- that those students want, without taking it on, in a full and clear and courageous way. And you know, I tell you I trust Malia in an argument. If a knucklehead on a college campus starts talking about her, I guarantee you she will give as good as she gets.STEPHANOPOULOS: Sounds like you've been having some good dinner table conversations. Mr. President, thank you.OBAMA: Thank you.",0

"From no selfie­s to perfec­ting the curtsy, the new Duches­s will be adjust­ing to a whole new lifest­yle  The Royal wedding created a lot of buzz worldwide and was followed by many chanting how ‘lucky’ Meghan Markle is to marry a prince. However, what most may not know is that it isn’t all fun and games. Becoming a royal comes with a lot of responsibility and rules.  Meghan too, will have to adhere to many of these royal rules to avoid major faux pas and stay in the Queen’s good books. Compiled from E! News, here are 17 rules the recently appointed Duchess of Sussex will have to follow.  1. No selfies  During her first official event with Prince Harry, Meghan revealed that she is no longer able to take selfies with fans. “We’re not allowed to do selfies,” she stated.  The rule was created to encourage people to make eye contact and make conversation with royals, rather than turning their backs to them to take a selfie.  2. No more autographs  The former Suits star most definitely has a pretty big fan following and has probably given out countless autographs in the past. However, under no circumstances is she allowed to sign any more autographs.  Prince Harry, Meghan Markle make first appearance after royal wedding  3. So long social media  Along with all her social media accounts, Meghan also had to give up her lifestyle blog The Tig. All social media for her is now handled by the royal family’s various accounts, but most updates about her and Harry are handled through the Kensington Palace account, as are the updates about Prince William and Kate Middleton.  Meghan’s not allowed to have her own social media page, which is why her own lifestyle blog and Instagram, The Tig, went dark last year.  4. No dark nails  Members of the Royal Family are prohibited from wearing dark and coloured nail polish. Meghan wore Essie’s Ballet Slippers to the Royal Wedding, which happens to be the Queen’s favourite. We are pretty sure that the colour is here to stay.  5. Travelling with mourning clothes  Ever since the then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip had to travel back to England from Africa in regular clothes due to King George’s passing, it is imperative that all royals always travel with a set of funeral clothes in order to be respectful.  6. Perfecting the curtsy  The queen expects female family members, including Kate Middleton and Camilla Parker Bowles, to curtsy when they enter a room in her presence, even when it’s an informal occasion. So, Meghan better get used to the curtsy. If she is at an official event, the Duchess must also curtsy to anyone who outranks her title.  7. Miniskirts – a big no no!    The queen disapproves of hemlines higher than the knee. Regular female visitors such as Kate, Camilla, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are already aware of the fashion stipulation. If Meghan hasn’t already ditched her little black dresses or her minis, it’s time for her to do so.  8. No crossed legs  It’s frowned upon for Royal family members to cross their legs. You’ll never see Kate crossing her legs anywhere other than at her ankles. It’s time for Meghan to let go of any such habit.  9. No Wedges  Apparently, the Queen is repelled by wedged heels. So if Meghan owns any such pairs, she will have to throw them out immediately! Although Kate has been seen wearing the despised shoes, you will never find a photo of the Duchess of Cambridge rockin’ a wedge in front of her royal highness.  10. Dinnertime is 20:30  When dining with her majesty, Meghan will always have to eat at 8:30pm until 10pm. The Queen is known for strictly adhering to her royal schedule.  Urwa Hocane trolled mercilessly over royal wedding comparison  11. No seating choices    At a Royal family gathering, Meghan will always have to be seated next to Prince Harry.  12. Entering rooms in a particular order    There is a strict code of conduct for how to enter a room when you are with the royals. Here’s the royal order: Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William, Kate, Prince Harry and then Meghan.  13. Eating depending on the Queen  Meghan cannot begin eating her meal until the Queen has started hers. The former actor also needs to stop eating as soon as the Queen stops eating, even if there is still food left on the plate.  14. No sleeping until the Queen sleeps  If the newly weds stay at the Queen’s house, they have to stay up until her majesty falls asleep. Apparently it’s considered bad form to call it a night before the monarch.  15. Do not pass go    This may seem like an unusual rule but Monopoly is not allowed. Back in 2008, the Leeds Building Society gave the Duke of York Prince Andrew the board game of Monopoly to which he responded, “We’re not allowed to play Monopoly at home. It gets too vicious.”  16. Pinkies to stay in  Tea time is a very important time for royals. Etiquette expert Myka Meier shared that the correct way to drink tea is to use your thumb and index finger to hold the top of the handle, while the middle finger supports the bottom.  You should also sip from the same spot the entire time so that the rim doesn’t get lipstick stains. If you are a coffee drinker, you should loop your index finger through the handle. But beware—no pinkies out. This is exactly how the royals are expected to drink beverages.  17. No shellfish  It’s an ancient royal tradition to say no to shellfish in order to avoid food poisoning. While the Royal family does not always follow this rule, her royal highness the Queen has apparently never touched shellfish in her entire life.  Have something to add to the story?

"It began, as do most of these family scandals, with an exhibition in The Daily Mail . One of Markle's childhood friends not only shared (and probably sold) a real boat full of private photos, ranging from school games to family vacations or his first wedding, but he gave a revealing interview, and some would say completely disloyal The theme ranged from the relatively innocent, such as how they became inseparable in elementary school and how it was for the private school for girls, to even more damaging revelations like the fact that this friend believes that fame ""changed"" Meghan. Even a headline circulated that the friend ""blamed"" Markle for the destruction of his first marriage.  To add insult to injury, Markle's stepsister, Samantha Markle, has been telling everyone, well, anything and everything they want to know about future royalty. It is widely known that the two women are not close (it is unknown the last time they spoke) and it is worth mentioning that she has plans to launch a book called The diary of the sister of Princess Pushy so that the timing of these interviews is anything but random. Samantha talked about whether Meghan will ask her father to take her down the hall and admitted that the relationship with Harry ""created a gap"" in the family.  The uncle of the future princess has also welcomed the photographers in her house and talked about the upcoming nuptials, although her comments were decidedly more positive and not at all derogatory, it still represents a phenomenon that all those who experience fame Almost instantaneous they have Supported: When someone you've met or spoken of leaves the carpentry shop for their own 15 minutes (or 15 seconds) of fame.",1
"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.",0
"Romance rumors are flying around Stranger Things stars Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer once again. This isn’t the first time the two have made fans wonder about their relationship; the IRL Nancy and Jonathan, who had crushes on each other in the show, have been rumored to be dating since early 2017, but still haven’t confirmed it.  Over the weekend, photographers snapped Charlie and Natalia holding hands on a leisurely stroll together in Paris. They shared a pair of earbuds and were also spotted with Charlie’s arm comfortably around Natalia’s shoulders. A cozy autumn walk around Paris is looking pretty good right now.  Holding hands obviously does not equal relationship, but fans are still thrilled about a possible pairing between the two stars.  Since the Stranger Things cast has faced so much publicity lately, we totally understand why Charlie and Natalia would want to keep a prospective romance quiet, and it’s totally their right to do so. Either way, a vacation in Paris doesn't sound too bad!  Related: “Stranger Things” Actor Charlie Heaton Has a Lookalike In Harry Styles",1
"Millie Bobby Brown is best known for her breakout role as telekinetic child Eleven in Netflix's 'Stranger Things.'  Who Is Millie Bobby Brown?  Born on February 19, 2004, Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress. Her family relocated to Los Angeles, where she began earning parts on shows like Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and NCIS. Her big break came with the Netflix sleeper hit Stranger Things, on which she stars as the gifted Eleven.  Early Life & Career  Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress who was born on February 19, 2004. Her family moved back to the U.K. when Brown was four years old and then moved to Orlando, Florida, four years later to start an entrepreneurial business. It was there that she was spotted by a talent scout who told her parents ""she has instincts you cannot teach.""  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Brown's parents sacrificed everything — moving their family to Los Angeles — to see Brown's acting dreams come true. Within three months of moving, Brown was given the role of Alice in ABC's Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and soon after she appeared as Madison O'Donnell in BBC America's Intruders. While Brown continued finding work in smaller roles on shows like NCIS, Modern Family and Grey’s Anatomy, she kept getting passed up for bigger roles.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  With no major jump in her career, her family had become so financially strained, they moved back to the U.K. to live with an aunt. ""I was devastated. I wasn’t getting work. I thought I was done,"" said Brown in an interview with the Daily Mail.  'Stranger Things'  However, as things were looking bleak, Brown landed an audition for Netflix's Stranger Things. ""I had to cry in the audition. My emotions were so raw, I hit it out of the park,"" she said. Weeks later, Brown was on a plane to begin filming in Atlanta.  Set in a 1980s Indiana town facing a threat from paranormal activity, Stranger Things became a hit upon its release in 2016, earning an array of awards. Meanwhile, Brown was heralded as one of its breakout performers for her role of Eleven, a girl with telekinetic powers.  The show's success was such that its primary actors all scored big raises heading into Season 3, with Brown rumored to be earning as much as its best-known star, Winona Ryder.  In April 2018, the 14-year-old Brown was the youngest person named to Time's 100 most influential list. Writing about her inclusion among the special group, actor Aaron Paul recalled how he was stunned by Brown's wisdom and perspective upon meeting her, feeling like he was talking to a future leader. ""Maybe that's why she's such an extraordinary actor,"" he wrote. ""She somehow understands the human experience as if she has lived it for a thousand years.""

The young couple confirmed their relationship with sweet messages addressed to one another via Instagram on Valentine's Day 2018 but broke up a few months later in July 2018.  Meanwhile, the unfortunate meme #takedownmilliebobbybrown was gaining steam on social media. Beginning with a user who accused Brown of pulling off her hijab and stamping on it, the thread took on a life of its own as people relayed their ""story"" of the actress attacking them while delivering expletive-filled homophobic comments. Brown ultimately deactivated her Twitter account in June 2018.",0
"Princess Kate knew what was coming.  Having battled severe pregnancy sickness, or Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), while expecting her first two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the royal mom would have been told by her medical team that the odds meant she would likely have the debilitating condition again.  Caitlin Dean, who is chairperson of the U.K.’s Pregnancy Sickness Support, is also a mother of three who suffered from HG in each of her pregnancies.  “A lot of people go into the second [pregnancy] hoping that it will not happen again, thinking [HG] will be one pregnancy and that every pregnancy is different,” says Dean. “But once you have it twice, that delusion is pretty much blown out of the water. So you have to prepare and be ready for this.  “For myself, I found it mentally and physically easier [during subsequent pregnancies] because I knew that I was going to have this and I knew what to expect from the treatment and what to expect generally.”  Lia Toby/WENN  On the flip side, she notes, for some women the symptoms “get worse each time.”  Dean says that for women who have previously battled HG, there’s a trepidation mixed in with the joy of anticipating a new baby.  “You know it’s coming, and it’s quite a scary prospect knowing you’re going to put yourself through that again. Certainly for me and my husband that was a huge decision. Not so much, ‘Let’s have a third kid,’ but, ‘Can we go through HG again?’ It’s certainly something that limits a lot of people who cannot go beyond two because of the condition.  “Preparing makes a huge amount of difference,” she adds. “What we suspect from experience is that if you prepare, you can start pre-emptive treatment and can prepare your household and your finances. The average woman doesn’t have the life that Kate has with people to cook meals and people to do their cleaning for them and look  after their children. For regular women that preparation is absolutely key.”  Such advance preparation, she adds, “doesn’t necessarily improve the sickness, although there is evidence that earlier treatment can reduce the overall impact of the symptoms. It isn’t a cure, but it makes it easier to have done that preparation. Then, if you don’t have HG on the third time, you haven’t lost anything. [That scenario] would be brilliant. Very occasionally women don’t get it again, but most of the time they do.”  Preparing also means keeping your younger children informed, says Dean, who wrote How To Be an HG Hero aimed at children of expectant moms.  Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage  “The idea with that is to help children understand why Mummy’s not in the picture and why she’s potentially in and out of hospital and how they can help,” says Dean. “My key thing is honesty. A lot of people try to hide the fact they’re pregnant in the first 12 weeks, because they’re worried about having to explain a miscarriage if it happens. If you are going in and out of hospital and lying in bed day after day and not telling your kids the reason why, they’re just going to worry about it and make up in their own heads why that is. Kids are resilient and they get on with that as long as you tell them the truth.  “It is debilitating and miserable and hopefully [Kate’s] children will not be worrying about it and understand that Mummy’s poorly.”  Samir Hussein/WireImage  Of course, it’s also tough on moms. “You have the fact that your other children are going to lose out on Mummy, and you have that guilt at not being able to spend so much time with them.”  As for treatment, guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists include a first line of medication like Cyclizine, which is an anti-histamine and works to combat vomiting, and Ondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting.  “On top of that, it is IV fluids ­if she’s not keeping food or fluids down,” says Dean, who is not involved in Kate’s treatment. “The main things is to keep her hydrated and able to eat. We know that malnutrition and dehydration can have a negative effect on the fetus. The idea that baby’s fine with a starving mum just isn’t true. It is important to keep mums hydrated so that they can eat as much as they need to or are able to.”",0

"In the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who, regeneration is a biological ability exhibited by the Time Lords, a race of fictional humanoids originating on the planet Gallifrey. This process allows a Time Lord to undergo a transformation into a new physical form and a somewhat different personality after instances which would normally result in death. Regeneration has been used twelve times throughout the history of the franchise as a device for introducing a new actor for the lead role of its main character, the Doctor. Other Time Lords and similar characters have also regenerated, usually for narrative, rather than casting, reasons.  The current incarnation of the Doctor is played by Jodie Whittaker, following the regeneration of the Twelfth Doctor (portrayed by Peter Capaldi) during the 2017 Christmas special ""Twice Upon a Time"".  Conceptual history [ edit ]  Inspiration [ edit ]  The concept of regeneration was created in 1966 by the writers of Doctor Who as a method of replacing the leading actor. The role of the Doctor had been played by William Hartnell since the programme began in 1963 but, by 1966, it was increasingly apparent that Hartnell's health was deteriorating and he was becoming more difficult to work with. Producer John Wiles had, following several clashes with Hartnell, intended to have the actor replaced in The Celestial Toymaker; during two episodes of that serial, the Doctor is invisible (owing to Hartnell being on holiday during the recording). Wiles' plan was for the character to reappear played by a new actor. This proposal was vetoed by Gerald Savory, the BBC's Head of Serials (and Wiles' superior), which led to Wiles leaving before The Celestial Toymaker was produced.[1] However, it was apparent that it would not be possible for Hartnell to continue for much longer.  On 29 July 1966, production concluded on the final episode of The Smugglers, the last serial recorded in the third production block.[citation needed] During production, Hartnell and producer Innes Lloyd had reached an agreement that he should leave the role, having starred in one more serial that would see a handover to a new actor, which would be the first one produced as part of Season 4. Script editor Gerry Davis proposed that, since the Doctor had already been established as an alien, the character could die and return in a new body. Lloyd took this further by suggesting that the Doctor could do this ""renewal"" regularly, transforming from an older man to a younger one; this would allow for the convenient recasting of the role when necessary.[citation needed] The process itself was modelled on LSD trips, with the experience being like the ""hell and dank horror"" of taking the drug.[2]  At the conclusion of The Tenth Planet, the First Doctor collapses from apparent old age and exhaustion, having commented earlier that his body was ""wearing a bit thin"". Then, before the eyes of his companions Ben and Polly, and of the viewing audience, his features shift into that of the Second Doctor, played by Patrick Troughton. In The Power of the Daleks, the Second Doctor's first story, the Doctor draws an analogy between the renewal and a caterpillar turning into a butterfly.[3]  Developing the concept [ edit ]  It was not clear initially whether the renewal was a natural ability of the Doctor's as opposed to a process initiated by technology. In Power of the Daleks, the Second Doctor describes his renewal as a function of his TARDIS time machine, stating that ""without it, [he] couldn't survive.""[3]  When Troughton left the series in 1969, the Doctor was renewed again, but this time the change was forced on him by the Time Lords at the conclusion of The War Games, where it is referred to as a ""change of appearance"". As with the first change, this language suggested only a superficial physical change, not one of personality, although Jon Pertwee's portrayal of the Third Doctor also differed quite substantially from Troughton's. Unlike the previous change, this one is treated as a punishment rather than a natural process: in The War Games the Doctor protests, ""You can't just change what I look like without consulting me!""  As the series continued, more aspects of the regenerative process were introduced, but the basic concepts of regeneration as accepted by fans of the series today were only firmly established in the final scene of Planet of the Spiders (1974), when Pertwee's Third Doctor turns into Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor. In this scene, the change is called ""regeneration"" for the first time, and is explained as a biological process that occurs when a Time Lord's body is dying. It is also stated that following the regeneration the Doctor's brain cells would be shaken up and his behaviour would be ""erratic"" for a time, something that would be evident for most subsequent regenerations.  In the About Time reference series Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood note that the officially licensed magazine, Doctor Who Monthly, stated in a ""Matrix Data-Bank"" column in 1982 that its readers should not confuse the ""regenerations"" of later incarnations with the ""rejuvenation"" of Hartnell into Troughton.[4] However, dialogue within the series itself explicitly includes the First-to-Second ""rejuvenation"" when enumerating the Doctor's regenerations (for example in Mawdryn Undead (1983)).  Transitions [ edit ]  Logopolis, 1981, and Castrovalva, 1982) The Fourth Doctor regenerates into the Fifth Doctor (from, 1981, and, 1982)  The regeneration ""effect"" was accomplished during the series' original run from 1963–1989 primarily through the use of video mixing. Originally, the plan was to have Hartnell collapse at the end of The Tenth Planet with his cloak over his face, which would then be pulled back to reveal Troughton in the next serial. However, vision mixer Shirley Coward discovered and took advantage of a malfunction in the mixing desk which allowed Hartnell's image to be overexposed to the point of almost whiting out the screen, then fading back in to reveal Troughton's face. This also meant that the regeneration scene could take place with both actors at the conclusion of The Tenth Planet, and Troughton was accordingly signed up to participate.[citation needed]  Subsequent regenerations retained essentially the same method, with or without additional video or make-up effects. The transition from the Fourth to the Fifth Doctor used an additional make-up effect representing a transitional form known as the Watcher, but aside from this, other regenerations in the original series run simply mixed the image of the incoming actor on top of the outgoing one. The transition from the Seventh to the Eighth Doctor in the 1996 television movie took advantage of the higher budget and modern computer animation technology to ""morph"" the features of Sylvester McCoy into those of Paul McGann.  With the exception of the transitions from the Second to Third, each regeneration was shown on-screen, with the previous incumbent in the role symbolically ""handing off"" the character to the next. The Second Doctor was never seen to actually change into the Third, simply fading off into darkness at the end of The War Games and then stumbling out of the TARDIS, already regenerated, at the start of Spearhead from Space (1970).  The regeneration of the Sixth Doctor into the Seventh is the only time that a single actor took on the roles of two incarnations of the Doctor. Colin Baker declined the invitation to film the regeneration sequence at the start of Time and the Rani (1987) due to the circumstances in which the BBC dismissed him from the role.[citation needed] As a result, Sylvester McCoy had to don his predecessor's costume and a blond curly wig, lying face down, with the mixing effect to the Doctor's ""new"" features occurring as he was turned over.  The 2005 series, which revived the programme after its cancellation 16 years earlier, began with the Ninth Doctor already regenerated and no explanation given as to the circumstances behind the change (although a scene in the debut episode ""Rose"" when the Doctor commented on his appearance in a mirror indicated that the change had recently occurred). In the documentary series Doctor Who Confidential, producer Russell T Davies explained his reasoning that, after such a long hiatus, a regeneration in the first episode would be not only confusing for new viewers but also lacking in dramatic impact, as there would have been no emotional investment in the character being replaced.[5] The regeneration into the Ninth Doctor was later seen and explained in ""The Day of the Doctor"" (2013). In this episode, the War Doctor automatically begins a regeneration due to old age at the end of the Last Great Time War. However, the full transition is not seen with only the start of the regeneration being shown.  The regeneration of the Ninth Doctor into the Tenth at the end of ""The Parting of the Ways"" (2005) used computer effects to morph Christopher Eccleston into David Tennant. In the episode of Doctor Who Confidential accompanying the episode ""Utopia"" (2007), where the same effect is used for the Master's regeneration, it is stated that the production team decided that this would be a common effect for all future Time Lord regenerations, rather than each regeneration being designed uniquely at the whim of the individual director. This style of transition is seen again in ""The Stolen Earth""/""Journey's End"" (2008) both when the Doctor undergoes an aborted regeneration, and when his hand spawns a clone in the second part; in The End of Time (2010) during which Matt Smith took over the role as the Eleventh Doctor; in ""The Impossible Astronaut"" when the Doctor is shot twice and seemingly killed; in ""Day of the Moon"" when a young girl regenerates; and in ""Let's Kill Hitler"" when Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) is shot and regenerates into River Song (Alex Kingston). ""The Night of the Doctor"" and ""The Day of the Doctor"" subsequently use the effect to show the Eighth Doctor and War Doctor's regenerations respectively. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor uses steady beams of light as opposed to the flame effect used for other revived series regenerations. In the Series 10 episode ""The Lie of the Land"", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration as part of a plan to test if Bill still has free will. The effect used is consistent with the one used in the modern series, with the Doctor's hands glowing and emitting regeneration energy before he enters full regeneration. However, as the regeneration was not real, it did not use up a regeneration and the Doctor did not change bodies.  The regeneration from the Eleventh to the Twelfth Doctor slightly differs from other regenerations from the revived series. During ""The Time of the Doctor"", the Eleventh Doctor reveals that he has used all his regenerations and is in fact in his thirteen and final body, leading to his aged appearance during the events of the episode. At the conclusion, the Time Lords grant him a new regeneration cycle, and he begins his thirteenth regeneration in the explosive manner that has become tradition (so explosive that it destroys invading Dalek forces including a ship and the village of Christmas in the process). However, as this regeneration is the first in a new cycle, it initially only ""resets"" his current body back to its youthful appearance (the Doctor referring to this as the cycle ""breaking in""), and the eventual transition to the Twelfth Doctor happens with a flash and the actor suddenly lurching back, standing back up to reveal the new Doctor.  In the 2017 Christmas special Twice Upon a Time, the Twelfth Doctor completes his regeneration into the Thirteenth Doctor (played by incumbent actress Jodie Whittaker). The effect used was more akin to the Tenth Doctor's regeneration to the Eleventh, with an explosive energy discharge being released from the Doctor, and steady streams of regeneration energy being emitted from his hands and head before his features were morphed into Whittaker's.  Characteristics within the series [ edit ]  Relationship with the TARDIS [ edit ]  It is mentioned that the TARDIS assists the Doctor during the regenerative process, as suggested by the Second Doctor's statement to this effect shortly after regenerating from the First. This is reiterated by Jack Harkness' insistence that the Doctor be taken into the TARDIS having been shot by a Dalek in ""The Stolen Earth"". Of the six occasions on which the Doctor has regenerated outside the TARDIS: one is forced on him by the Time Lords (Second to Third Doctor, The War Games); one requires a Time Lord to give the Doctor's cells a ""little push"" to start the process (Third to Fourth, Planet of the Spiders); one results in his being dependent on the TARDIS's ""Zero Room"", a chamber sealed from all outside forces, to help him recover (Fourth to Fifth, Castrovalva); one occurs a few hours after he has actually ""died"" (Seventh to Eighth, the 1996 television film; the delay at is, however, shown to have been caused by anaesthetic, rather than the Doctor's distance from the TARDIS); one is induced by the Sisterhood of Karn after reviving the Doctor from actual death (Eighth Doctor, ""The Night of the Doctor""). The Seventh to Eighth regeneration remains the only one that takes place significantly far away from the TARDIS, without any obvious interaction from other Time Lords and results in the Doctor suffering near-complete amnesia for nearly a day until an event inside the TARDIS triggers his memories to return. The future Eleventh Doctor is killed in mid-regeneration, showing he is vulnerable to death while regenerating and as such his need for the TARDIS may be for safety rather than aid. However it is later revealed that this regeneration was indeed a simulation since the Doctor who was shot was actually a Teselecta robot. The Eleventh Doctor starts his regeneration outside the TARDIS though he does end it inside it. In the case of the Twelfth Doctor, he briefly begins his regeneration after being electrocuted by a Mondasian Cyberman away from the TARDIS, but holds it off. When his actual regeneration starts, he emerges from the TARDIS as he struggles to hold it back. When the Twelfth Doctor finally does regenerate, it is within the TARDIS. As the Doctor contemplates his regeneration, the TARDIS appears to make its opinion on the matter known by flashing its lights at the Doctor, eliciting a response from him.  Energy release and increased strength [ edit ]  The exact mechanism that makes regeneration possible is not stated in the television series, but it is generally assumed in the spin-off media that the ability to regenerate may be linked to what is known as the ""Rassilon Imprimatur"", the symbiotic nuclei of a Time Lord that bonds him or her to a TARDIS, and allows his or her body to withstand the molecular stresses of time travel (The Two Doctors, 1985).[note 1]  In ""The Christmas Invasion"" (2005) it is stated that the regenerative cycle generates a large amount of energy that suffuses the Time Lord's body, and also shown that residual effects from a regeneration allow him to grow back a hand within the first 15 hours after the initial start of the regeneration. Accordingly, in ""Let's Kill Hitler"", River Song is able to repel bullets after regenerating. She is later able to send off an energy wave soon after her regeneration, though this particular feat may be one of the abilities gained during this time.  In the series four finale of the revived series, ""Journey's End"", an injured Tenth Doctor manages to avert a full regeneration by channelling ""excess regenerative energy"" into his severed hand, allowing him to heal without changing form. The limb ends up developing into a half-human clone when Donna Noble touches it; the event, a ""two-way"" ""Human-Time Lord Meta-Crisis"", also gives Donna a Time Lord's mind.  Increased strength is sometimes a temporary by-product of regeneration. Shortly after his third regeneration, the Fourth Doctor karate-chopped a brick in half in episode one of Robot, but was unable to repeat the action later in the same serial. In the moments following his regeneration into his eighth incarnation, the Doctor possessed enough physical strength to batter a steel door completely off its hinges. In ""Twice Upon a Time"", the First Doctor's dying of old age had earlier rendered him ""weak as a kitten"", but his oncoming regeneration temporarily provides him with renewed strength and vitality (as explained to him by the Twelfth Doctor).  In The End of Time when the Tenth Doctor regenerates into the Eleventh Doctor, the release of energy damages the TARDIS to the extent that components fall, the door's windows smash and the TARDIS then flies uncontrollably over Earth before crash-landing in Amy Pond's garden. Later, when the Eleventh Doctor begins his regeneration into the Twelfth Doctor in ""The Time of the Doctor"", he is able to control his regeneration energy and sends out energy blasts that obliterate nearby Daleks and an entire Dalek saucer. The release of energy also causes a shockwave that severely damages the town where the regeneration took place.  The Twelfth Doctor's regeneration into the Thirteenth is also quite explosive; while the streams of regeneration energy being emitted from the Doctor cause some minor damage to the console room, the full extent is revealed when it begins to explode immediately after the Doctor attempts to operate it, and she ends up falling from the TARDIS.  Personality change [ edit ]  With regeneration also comes a change of personality. The viewing audience sees this most often and most dramatically in the differing quirks and personality traits of the Doctor's various incarnations. The Doctor's core personality traits of heroism and intolerance of injustice are still retained, but in The End of Time the Tenth Doctor laments that demise of his current incarnation, with its own personality and attributes, makes for something much akin to an actual death. His last words before regenerating are ""I don't want to go.""  Shortly after the regeneration process, the Doctor sometimes goes through a period of physical and psychological instability. The Fourth Doctor described it as ""a new body is like a new house - takes a little bit of time to settle in"". The Second Doctor experiences crippling pain after his first regeneration (in The Power of the Daleks), while the Third Doctor collapses outside the TARDIS following his regeneration (in Spearhead from Space). The Fourth Doctor started rambling random phrases and possessed a higher than usual strength; he could cut a brick in half merely with his hand (in Robot). The Fifth Doctor (in Castrovalva) begins reverting to his previous personalities, and the Sixth Doctor experiences extreme paranoia, flying into a murderous rage and nearly killing his companion (The Twin Dilemma, 1984). The Eighth Doctor experienced amnesia as a result of post-regeneration trauma (the 1996 television film); uniquely, the Doctor was ""not alive"" at the time of this regeneration. The regeneration from the Ninth to the Tenth Doctor sees the Doctor experiencing sudden spasms and great pain (""Children in Need special""), and later being unconscious for most of the next fifteen hours (""The Christmas Invasion""). The regeneration from the Tenth to the Eleventh Doctor caused the Doctor to experience strange food cravings, only to be disgusted by them upon actually trying them (""The Eleventh Hour""). The Twelfth Doctor forgot how to fly the TARDIS (as well as the name of the TARDIS) right after the regeneration process in The Time of the Doctor. The Brain of Morbius implies that Time Lords other than the Doctor may experience difficult regenerations, since the Sisterhood of Karn had been supplying them with an ""elixir of life"" that could assist the process. In ""The Night of the Doctor"", the Sisterhood tell the Eighth Doctor they can provide elixirs to give rise to non-random regenerations, allowing the Doctor to specify either a physical type or personality.  The Master showed a dramatic personality change upon regenerating into the Mistress/Missy. In that form, she wants nothing more than to renew her bond with the Doctor, even calling him her ""boyfriend"" at one point. (""Deep Breath, Death in Heaven"") When she met him again, Missy pretended to be an android and kissed him passionately. (""Dark Water"") Despite still being manic and a psychopath, she later showed a willingness to reform, spending centuries in the Doctor's custody as a show of her commitment. Later, she felt torn between the Doctor, who represented her repentance, and her past incarnation, who represented a return to her old ways; she ultimately chose the Doctor, for which her past incarnation killed her in disgust. In turn, though Missy expressed a love for who she was in her past incarnation, she forced his own regeneration into her to ensure she would become the person she now was (""The Doctor Falls"").  Extent of physical change [ edit ]  The Doctor has always regenerated into a humanoid form. However, when explaining the process of regeneration to Rose at the end of ""The Parting of the Ways"", the Ninth Doctor suggests that his new form could have ""two heads"", or even ""no head"", and in the 2005 Children in Need special, which takes place immediately after that episode, the newly regenerated Tenth Doctor, while examining his new body, makes a point of checking that he has two arms, two legs and two hands, implying that regenerations can sometimes result in physically deformed or non-humanoid forms; it is not clear whether or not these two moments are intended as jokes. The beginning of Destiny of the Daleks (1979) featured Romana trying out a number of potential forms, two of which included a blue-skinned pygmy and a giantess.  Whether Time Lords could change gender in regeneration was never addressed onscreen during the classic series and not explicitly focused on for much of the revival. In The Hand of Fear (1976), the Kastrian Eldrad compared his transformation from female to male to Time Lord regeneration, possibly suggesting the process could produce a sex change. The concept of Time Lords changing gender upon regeneration was seeded throughout Moffat's tenure as showrunner. In the second part of The End of Time (2010), the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) briefly checks for an Adam's apple upon regeneration to confirm if he is still a man. In the 2011 episode ""The Doctor's Wife"", the Doctor recalls a Time Lord acquaintance known as the Corsair, who had at least two female incarnations.[6] In the 2013 short ""Night of the Doctor"", the Sisterhood of Karn offer a dying Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) control over his inevitable regeneration, with ""man or woman"" being touted as possibilities.[7] The first on-screen cross-gender regeneration was shown in the 2015 episode ""Hell Bent"", in which a white male Gallifreyan general (Ken Bones) regenerates into a black woman (T'Nia Miller), who states that her previous incarnation was the only time she had been a man.[8]  The most notable Time Lord to have appeared in both male and female forms prior to Whittaker's casting is the Doctor's nemesis, The Master, portrayed from 2014 to 2017 by Scottish actress Michelle Gomez. This character was known as Missy, short for ""Mistress"".[9] In ""World Enough and Time"" (2017), the Doctor tells his companion Bill Potts, in reference to Missy, that Time Lords are mostly beyond gender norms and stereotypes; however, Bill points out that the males and females of the species collectively refer to themselves by a male title. From ""Twice Upon a Time"" onward, Jodie Whittaker portrays the Thirteenth Doctor, the Doctor's first female incarnation.  Female Doctors were previously explored in spin-off productions; Joanna Lumley appeared as a satirical version of the Thirteenth Doctor in the 1999 Comic Relief special The Curse of Fatal Death. Arabella Weir also played an alternate Third Doctor in the Doctor Who Unbound Big Finish episode Exile. Neither portrayal is typically considered to be within the show's main continuity.[10] Spin-off media have also depicted more drastic regenerations than the TV series. For example, in the Big Finish Productions audio Circular Time, a Time Lord known as Cardinal Zero regenerates into an avian life-form after being poisoned.[11]  Control over regeneration [ edit ]  The Doctor's regenerations are always involuntary, and he has no control over his final appearance. In ""The Parting of the Ways"" (2005), the Ninth Doctor describes the process as ""a bit dodgy""—i.e., somewhat dangerous or uncertain—and the Tenth Doctor refers to regeneration as ""a lottery"" (""The Day of the Doctor"", 2013). For example, despite an apparent wish for this to occur, neither the Tenth nor the Eleventh Doctors regenerated into redheads. The sole known exception to this is the Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor (""The Night of the Doctor"", 2013), as the Doctor was able to consume a potion made by the Sisterhood of Karn which ensured his next body was a warrior able to fight in the last Great Time War, though he didn't appear to make any specifications about the actual physical appearance. The Doctor was also once given the chance to choose his appearance upon his forced regeneration by the Time Lords in The War Games (1969) but rejected all of the options presented to him. The Time Lords grew tired of his stalling and thus sent him away to regenerate into the Third Doctor, an apparently random result. Alternatively, the Tenth Doctor was shown twice to exert control over regenerating, attributed by the Eleventh Doctor to ""having vanity issues at the time."" In ""Journey's End"" (2008), after being shot by a Dalek triggered a regeneration, the Tenth Doctor used the regeneration energy to heal his wounds, then channeled the remaining energy into his severed hand and purposely kept his current appearance. When he finally did regenerate into the Eleventh Doctor, he still consciously prevented himself from regenerating to prolong his time as his current incarnation for several hours. Doing this caused a more explosive regeneration that nearly destroyed the TARDIS.  In contrast, the first episode of Destiny of the Daleks (1979) depicts Romana undergoing a voluntary regeneration, in which she tries out several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of Princess Astra, a person she encountered in a previous adventure (The Armageddon Factor). Many writers of spin-off media have attempted to rationalise the difference between the Doctor's and Romana's regenerations. Doctor Who television writer and script editor Eric Saward suggests in his 1985 novelisation of The Twin Dilemma (1984) that Time Lords can control the appearance of their next body if they trigger the regeneration voluntarily, but not if the regeneration is caused by death or injury. The Doctor Who Role Playing Game by FASA suggests that some Time Lords have a special ability to control their regenerations. The fan reference book The Discontinuity Guide suggests that Romana's various ""try-ons"" were projections of potential future incarnations like the K'anpo Rinpoche/Cho Je situation in Planet of the Spiders.[12] Miles and Wood's About Time also mentions this while theorising that the Time Lords had improved the technology of regeneration since the Doctor's time; Romana, being of a later generation than the Doctor, would therefore have finer control over the regenerative process in its early stages.[13]  Other moments in the series suggest that other Time Lords have more control over their regeneration than that usually displayed by the Doctor. Prior to regenerating in the episode ""Utopia"" (2007), the Master expresses a desire to be ""young and strong"" like the Doctor and transforms accordingly. Subsequently, in ""Last of the Time Lords"", the Master is shot by Lucy Saxon and is able to prevent regeneration at will, despite the Doctor's pleas. In ""The Stolen Earth"" (2008), the Doctor begins to regenerate in a cliffhanger moment, but at the start of ""Journey's End"" (the following episode), he interrupts the process after healing his bodily injuries, redirecting the remaining regeneration energy into his preserved hand. In ""Let's Kill Hitler"", when Mels begins to regenerate into River Song, she says she is trying to concentrate so she can come out a particular dress size. In ""Nightmare in Silver"" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor suggests that he can trigger regeneration voluntarily, using the suggestion to threaten the Cyber-Planner invading his body and mind, saying ""I could regenerate now. Big blast of regeneration energy, burn out any little Cyber widgets in my brain, along with everything you're connected to. Don't want to. Use this me up, who knows what we'll get next? But I can."" (Even though by The Time Of The Doctor this was revealed to be a bluff due to the fact that the Eleventh Doctor was actually the final incarnation of his first regeneration cycle.) In ""The Girl Who Died"" (2015), the Twelfth Doctor speculates that he deliberately, if not subconsciously, chose the form of Caecilius (from ""The Fires of Pompeii"") to remind himself that he is a man who always saves people, even if it is just one. In ""The Doctor Falls"" (2017), the Doctor is wounded by Cybermen and starts to regenerate, but is able to hold back his regeneration, refusing to change again.  In ""Twice Upon a Time"" (2017), the Twelfth Doctor reveals that there is a period of time, what he calls ""a state of grace,"" when a regenerating Time Lord's current incarnation is restored to full health for a time if the incarnation resists regeneration. During this time, the incarnation must choose whether or not to regenerate. Once the period is over, if the Time Lord chooses not to regenerate, they will permanently die. Furthermore, as time passes during this ""state of grace,"" the Time Lord grows weaker as the period nears its end. The First, Tenth and Twelfth Doctors all used this period of time, though in the case of the Tenth Doctor it was to visit all of his former companions a final time before regenerating rather than out of some form of uncertainty. While in his ""state of grace,"" the First Doctor's face got ""mixed up"" due to his resisting regeneration, an effect not seen with his subsequent incarnations who used the period.  Recognition of the regenerated [ edit ]  The television series is inconsistent on the question of whether Time Lords can recognise each other across regenerations. For example, in The Deadly Assassin an old classmate of the Doctor's, Runcible, is slow to recognise the Doctor in his fourth incarnation, and once he has, it then takes him a while to realise that his appearance has changed. However, in The Armageddon Factor (1978), Drax, another old classmate, recognises the Fourth Doctor immediately although they had not seen each other since the Academy (the Doctor takes a while to remember Drax, though).  There is also inconsistency as to whether the Doctor can recognise his own future incarnations. In the original series, the Doctors usually have no difficulty recognising one another (in The Three Doctors, the First, Second, and Third Doctors all know one another on sight. However, in The Five Doctors, the First Doctor does not recognise the Fifth Doctor as himself and needs to be introduced by the Fifth as his fourth regeneration. In Time Crash, after the TARDIS is at different points in its own timeline merge due to downed shields, the Fifth Doctor spends much of the mini-episode believing that the Tenth was merely a fan who had somehow gotten into his TARDIS, having somehow altered the 'desktop theme'; the Tenth Doctor constantly tries to convince his younger self that he is his future self, only doing so by using a predestination paradox to cancel out a universe-destroying black hole with a supernova by blowing up the TARDIS. When the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctor meet each other in The Day of the Doctor, the Tenth Doctor appears to sceptically recognise his successor, yet he appears to be fully convinced only after both compare their respective sonic screwdrivers. The War Doctor on the other hand is initially completely oblivious to meet two of his future regenerations (initially mistaking them for future companions), again being convinced by their sonic screwdrivers. When the First Doctor meets the Twelfth Doctor, the First Doctor sees his future self as another Time Lord come to take back his TARDIS and requires convincing as to otherwise.  The Daleks' ability to recognise the Doctor also varies: they recognise him outright in The Power of the Daleks but need confirmation from other sources in Revelation of the Daleks, ""Doomsday"" and ""The Pilot"". In ""Asylum of the Daleks"", the Daleks' knowledge of the Doctor is tied to a psychic link among them called the path-web, which is hacked to make them forget him. The Cybermen have their own method of recognising the Doctor, usually through his past incarnations, as seen in Earthshock and ""The Next Doctor"".  In ""Utopia"", while the Master was under the chameleon arch, the Doctor could not sense that he was a Time Lord. After the Master's personality reasserted itself, the Doctor instantly sensed him and could tell which Time Lord it was without being told. In ""The Sound of Drums"", the Doctor stated that he would be able to recognize the regenerated Master on sight despite having never seen his new incarnation, claiming that Time Lords could always recognize each other. Due to the Master's Archangel Network, the Doctor's ability to sense another Time Lord had been blocked up to that point. During ""The End of Time"", the Master and the Doctor could sense each other's presence when in proximity, with both appearing to sniff each other out. However, this ability has a limited range as stated by the Doctor to Wilfred Mott. While he could sense that the Master was still on Earth, he could not tell where he was as the Master was too far away to track precisely. In ""Dark Water"", The Doctor failed to recognize that Missy was a regeneration of The Master, and may not have been able to tell that she was a Time Lord at all until she revealed her identity to him. In ""World Enough and Time"", the disguised Master figured out that Missy was his own future self, but this was due to deduction from her mannerisms rather than any sort of special ability. In turn, Missy did not realize that the disguised Master was another Time Lord, let alone her own past self until he revealed himself.  Maximum number of regenerations in a cycle [ edit ]  In The Deadly Assassin (1976), it is established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This statement is later repeated in Mawdryn Undead (1983), the 1996 TV film and ""The Time of the Doctor"" (2013). This aspect became embedded in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time.[14][15] The BBC's Series 4 FAQ[16] suggested that since the Time Lords were believed to be dead and their rules destroyed, the Doctor may be able to regenerate indefinitely: ""Now that his people are gone, who knows? Time Lords used to have thirteen lives."" In Death of the Doctor (a 2010 The Sarah Jane Adventures serial), the Eleventh Doctor says he can regenerate 507 times (early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he would say there is no limit to the number of regenerations).[17] However, writer Russell T Davies explained in an interview with SFX that this line was not intended to be taken seriously and insisted that the ""thirteen lives"" rule was too deeply entrenched in the viewer consciousness for his throwaway line to affect it.[18]  However, the series has depicted exceptions to this rule in the career of the renegade Time Lord the Master. When the Master finds himself at the end of his regenerative cycle in The Keeper of Traken (1981), he takes possession of the body of another person to continue living, although he was using the Source of Traken to bind his mind to the body. In The Five Doctors (1983), the Master is offered a new cycle of regenerations by the High Council of the Time Lords in exchange for his help. In the 1996 television movie, the Master temporarily inhabits the body of a human, and attempts to take the Doctor's remaining regenerations. In ""The Sound of Drums"" (2007), the Master is revealed to have been granted a new body by the Time Lords during the Time War. In this new body, the Master appears to have a new regeneration cycle. The Master regenerates in ""Utopia"" (2007) and ""The Doctor Falls"" (2017) with dialogue in the latter episode suggesting he has at least one more regeneration.  The number of previous incarnations of the Doctor was at first unclear within the series. In the Fourth Doctor story The Brain of Morbius (1976), the Doctor participates in a mental ‘duel’ with another Time Lord and the machine to which their minds are connected begins to project the faces of the ""losing"" contestant’s regenerations in chronologically descending order. As the Doctor is overpowered by Morbius, the images change successively to those of the third, second and first Doctors, then eight further faces appear. It was the intention of producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes that images were even earlier incarnations of the Doctor.[citation needed][19] However, the narrative does not explicitly confirm that the faces do represent incarnations of the Doctor, even though, as the faces are shown, Morbius cries ""How far Doctor? How long have you lived?"", indicating that they are not incarnations of Morbius, but rather that it is the Doctor's past being shown.[20]  In other episodes, it was firmly established that the William Hartnell incarnation of the Doctor was the very first. In The Three Doctors, the Time Lord President describes the Hartnell incarnation as ""the earliest Doctor"". This is cemented in The Five Doctors when Peter Davison's Fifth Doctor (introducing himself to the First Doctor) says that he is the fourth regeneration, meaning that there have been five of him. The First Doctor also refers to himself as ""the original"". Episodes of the revival series showing the lives of the Doctor -- ""The Next Doctor"", ""The Eleventh Hour"", ""The Day of the Doctor"" and ""The Husbands of River Song""—all begin with the William Hartnell incarnation. In ""Twice Upon a Time"", the William Hartnell incarnation is depicted as indeed being the very first incarnation with the First Doctor expressing fear about undergoing his very first regeneration throughout the story.  In ""The Lodger"", after the Eleventh Doctor shows Craig who he is, he points to his face and says, ""Eleventh"". However, in ""The Name of the Doctor"", when the Doctor rescues Clara from inside his own time stream, they both see another figure that Clara doesn't recognise. The Doctor then reveals that this is a past incarnation that he deemed unworthy of the name ""Doctor"" due to the atrocities he committed during the Time War, and only accepted him after learning the truth of how the war ended (""The Day of the Doctor"").[21] Ultimately, in ""The Time of the Doctor"" the Eleventh Doctor reveals that, counting the War Doctor and the Tenth's aborted regeneration, he is actually in his final incarnation, reaching a point where he is dying of old age after centuries of conflict with the Daleks and others on the planet Trenzalore. However, at the behest of Clara, the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle, allowing a thirteenth regeneration into an incarnation known as the Twelfth Doctor. The Twelfth Doctor is later able to regenerate into a female incarnation known as the Thirteenth Doctor after suffering fatal injuries during a battle.  In ""The Time of the Doctor"", the Eleventh Doctor describes his new regeneration ability as the start of a new 'cycle', implying that he's been restored to the customary twelve regenerations. However, in ""Kill the Moon"", the Twelfth Doctor says he's ""not entirely sure [he] won't keep regenerating forever,"" once again raising the question regarding any limits to this ability. In ""Hell Bent"", Rassilon asks the Doctor ""How many regenerations did we grant you?"", and during ""The Doctor Falls"", two incarnations of the Master express uncertainty about how long it would take them to kill the Doctor, further implying that the Doctor has a finite number of regenerations even as the exact amount remains undetermined.  Temporary potential future incarnations [ edit ]  In some cases, future potential incarnations can achieve independent, though temporary, existence. In Planet of the Spiders, a Time Lord, K'anpo Rinpoche, creates a corporeal projection of a future incarnation which has such an existence under the name Cho Je until he regenerates into that incarnation. The Valeyard, an ""amalgamation of the darker sides of [the Doctor's] nature, somewhere between [his] twelfth and final incarnation"", appears in The Trial of a Time Lord (1986) opposite the Sixth Doctor; the Valeyard is promised the remainder of the Doctor's regenerations. Another example is ""The Watcher"", who repeatedly appears to the Fourth Doctor in Logopolis (1981), and ultimately merges with him as part of his regeneration into his fifth incarnation.  The Time Lords' ability to change species during regeneration is referred to in the television movie by the Eighth Doctor in relation to the Master. Mavic Chen states that the First Doctor's resemblance to an Earth creature is ""only a disguise"" in The Daleks' Master Plan (1965). In Destiny of the Daleks (1979), the Fourth Doctor's Time Lady companion Romana demonstrates an apparent ability to ""try on"" different bodies from a number of different species during her regeneration, before settling on a final, humanoid form which physically resembles Princess Astra of Atrios.  Steven Moffat has said that reference will be made to Peter Capaldi's previous appearances in the Whoniverse during his tenure as the Twelfth Doctor: ""The face is not set from birth. It’s not like he was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that’s the case because in The War Games he has a choice of faces. So we know it’s not set, so where does he get those faces from? They can’t just be randomly generated because they've got lines. They've aged. When he turns into Peter he’ll actually have lines on his face. So where did that face come from?”[citation needed] In ""Deep Breath"" (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In ""The Girl Who Died"" (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision to save the life of Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in ""The Fires of Pompeii"" (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so.  Regeneration of non-Gallifreyans [ edit ]  The fact that the Master is inhabiting a non-Gallifreyan body when he is offered a new cycle of regenerations (see above) implies that it is possible to grant them to a non-Gallifreyan, albeit one inhabited by a Time Lord mind. In addition, River Song is shown to have the ability to regenerate due to altered DNA that has similarities to Time Lord DNA, a side effect of having been conceived on board the TARDIS as it travelled through the spacetime vortex. Non-Gallifreyans are also seen to regenerate in Underworld (1978) and Mawdryn Undead (1983), but with adverse side effects. In Mawdryn Undead, these appear to be the result of mishandling stolen technology, but in Underworld they are implied to be the inevitable result of limited technology that reinvigorates, rather than transforms, the subject's appearance (in this case, the Minyans, with whom the Time Lords shared much of their technology), thereby regenerating 'the body, not the soul'.  Failed/fake regeneration [ edit ]  It has been suggested in the series many times that regeneration is not guaranteed and can fail. After his cellular structure is decimated by the Metabelis crystals in Planet of the Spiders, the Third Doctor's regeneration requires ""a little push"" from fellow Time Lord K'anpo Rimpoche before it can proceed. As he succumbs to spectrox toxaemia in The Caves of Androzani, the Fifth Doctor says, ""I might regenerate... I don't know... It feels different this time... is this death?"" He then hallucinates, seeing his former companions encouraging him to survive, before the Master overwhelms them all, telling him he must die. The 1996 TV movie showed the Doctor's regeneration delayed for more than three hours, with the Eighth Doctor later remarking that the fact his Seventh incarnation was under anaesthesia at the time of his ""death"" could have ""destroyed the regenerative process"", and that he was ""dead too long this time"" prior to his regeneration. In many episodes, the Doctor doubts his own survival, though it is not always clear whether such statements refer to the death of only that particular incarnation. (The only time he makes a completely unambiguous distinction between these two scenarios – in The End of Time – he makes it clear that he regards regeneration as nearly as bad as death, because as he sees it, he dies and ""a new man"" walks away). In The Mind of Evil the Master points a conventional firearm at the Doctor and threatens to ""put a bullet through both [his] hearts,"" while in ""Forest of the Dead"", Professor Song warns that electrocution would stop both the Time Lord's hearts, killing him. In ""Turn Left"", in which the Tenth Doctor dies in a parallel world, a UNIT member speculates that what happened to the Doctor ""must have happened too fast for him to regenerate"" (It is suggested that he drowned without his future companion Donna Noble there to inspire him to leave). In The End of Time, the Doctor explains to Wilfred Mott that if he is killed before the regeneration can start, then it will fail.  In the Series 6 premiere, ""The Impossible Astronaut"", a future version of the Eleventh Doctor is shot twice by the titular astronaut and begins to regenerate. However he is then shot again and dies, showing that not only can he be killed before regeneration, but also during the process (However, the later revelation, in ""The Wedding of River Song"" that what was shot was in fact a mechanical avatar of the Doctor and not the real person calls this into question). In the episode ""Let's Kill Hitler"", the Doctor is poisoned by River Song which disables the ability to regenerate and he seemingly dies, although he is later revived when River gives up her remaining regenerations to save him. ""The Time of the Doctor"" later shows that the Doctor did not have any remaining regenerations at this time anyway.  In the mini-episode ""The Night of the Doctor"", the Eighth Doctor is killed when the ship he is on crashes onto the planet Karn, reinforcing the idea that a sudden, traumatic death may prevent regeneration. The Sisterhood of Karn explain that he was, in fact, dead, but they were able to use their Time Lord-based technology to revive him and force a regeneration anyway.  In ""Heaven Sent"", the Twelfth Doctor is badly burned by the Veil, preventing him from regenerating properly. However, as his island prison resets itself after leaving a room, he used what was left of his life to download a past version of himself out of the teleporter's hard drive, which also reset. This cycle of bringing himself back to life by burning his current body as energy for the process continued for approximately 4.5 billion years, according to the episode ""Hell Bent.""  In ""The Lie of the Land"", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration after his companion Bill Potts shoots him after he pretends to be siding with the Monks. The bullets that are fired are revealed to have been blanks, and the whole thing was a test by the Doctor to see if Bill was under the Monks' influence.  Transference of regenerative energy [ edit ]  In Mawdryn Undead, it is first stated that a Time Lord can transfer his regenerative life essence to another being. In that story, the Fifth Doctor is coerced by Mawdryn to give up his future regenerations in order to cure Nyssa and Tegan Jovanka from Mawdryn's disease. Although the transfer does not occur (due to the timely interference of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart), the Doctor states that the consequence of the transference would be that he would sacrifice his eight remaining lives and cease to be a Time Lord. It is not until ""Let's Kill Hitler"" that a similar transference is shown; in that instance, River Song sacrifices her own regenerative power in order to revive the dead Eleventh Doctor. The favour is returned in ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" in which River's wrist is repaired by the Doctor, who subsequently gives up a portion of his regenerative energy despite it later being revealed that the Doctor is out of regenerations at that point.  A major plot point of the 1996 TV movie involves the Master scheming to steal the Doctor's remaining regenerations for himself.  The Tenth Doctor also consciously aborts a regeneration in ""Journey's End"" and instead transfers the energy to his previously severed hand (from ""The Christmas Invasion""), which had been saved in a container by Captain Jack Harkness; when Donna Noble touches it, it creates an entirely new person - a ""meta-crisis"" half-human Doctor. The Eleventh Doctor confirms, before himself regenerating during the events of ""The Time of the Doctor"", that this action used up a full regeneration.  In ""The Witch's Familiar"", the Twelfth Doctor offers a small amount of regenerative energy to Dalek creator Davros to sustain him in his dying minutes a bit longer. The Doctor says that doing so ""may cost [him] an arm or a leg down the road"". Davros, however, siphons off much more regeneration energy from the Doctor to revitalize himself and transform the Daleks on Skaro into superior hybrid creatures. His plan backfires when decaying Daleks—incapable of dying, and kept in an underground 'sewer' system when their effective 'lives' have expired—are also reenergized and attack the Daleks on the surface. The Doctor reveals that he expected such a plot and knew it would backfire.  Regenerations depicted in the series [ edit ]  The Doctor's regenerations [ edit ]  The Tenth Doctor's fiery regeneration into the Eleventh Doctor.  Romana's regenerations [ edit ]  Romana's tongue-in-cheek regeneration scene in Destiny of the Daleks (1979) contrasts markedly with the Doctor's transformations. In the first episode of the serial, Romana undergoes regeneration, in the process trying out several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of Princess Astra, a character she encountered in a previous adventure (The Armageddon Factor).  Multiple attempts have been made in the spin-off media to explain the necessity for Romana's regeneration.  The Master's regenerations [ edit ]  The Master has only been shown to regenerate once onscreen. However, the Master does change appearance several times, often circumventing the limitations ordinarily placed upon Time Lords. Originally played by Roger Delgado, his decrepit later appearance (following Delgado's death) in The Deadly Assassin (1976) is explained as owing to the fact that he is in his final regeneration. He is driven to acquire a new regeneration cycle, but is ultimately able to circumvent the end of his life by possessing the body of Tremas (Antony Ainley) in The Keeper of Traken (1981). Ainley portrays the Master until the conclusion of the classic series, although still plots at several times to obtain a new regeneration cycle. In the 1996 TV movie, the Master is executed but cheats death by possessing a parasitic creature, which in turn possesses a human named Bruce (Eric Roberts), giving the Master another new form.  When the Master is reintroduced in 2007, exposition explains he was resurrected by the Time Lords to fight in the Time War, apparently with a new regeneration cycle. In ""Utopia"" (2007), he is fatally shot by his assistant and changes from a form known as Professor Yana, played by Derek Jacobi, into a new incarnation, played by John Simm. Before regenerating, the Master expresses desire to become ""young and strong"" like the Tenth Doctor. A character named Missy first appears in ""Deep Breath"" (2014) before being revealed as the Master in ""Dark Water"" (2014), having regenerated off-screen during the character's absence. For most of Missy's appearances, it is unknown how the Master regenerated into her. It is later revealed in ""The Doctor Falls"" that it was Missy herself who forced the regeneration. In an effort to ensure that she would come into existence and stand with the Doctor, Missy stabbed the Master in the back to trigger his regeneration, but made the wound ""precise"" so that he would have time to reach his TARDIS before the regeneration began. In return, the Master killed Missy with his laser screwdriver and stated that he'd disabled her regeneration so that she would die permanently of the shot. Though the Master's regeneration into Missy was left inevitable, it was not shown on-screen.  In several of the short stories published in the Doctor Who universe, some regenerations for the Master are seen including two separate reasons for the Roger Delgado incarnation's regeneration. In the short story Pandoric's Box, the Master is depicted as regenerating into Missy due to his battle with Rassilon who also regenerated as predicted by the Moment. However, this is contradicted by ""World Enough and Time"" and ""The Doctor Falls"".  River Song's regenerations [ edit ]  River Song, also known as Melody Pond has regenerated twice throughout the course of the sixth series. Although she is human and the daughter of Amy Pond (hence her surname) and Rory Williams, she was conceived on their wedding night aboard the TARDIS and therefore was born with genetic traits similar to the Doctor's own race, the Time Lords.  In ""Day of the Moon"" (2011), Melody Pond as a child (Sydney Wade) walks through a New York City alley at the end of the episode in early 1970, suffering from an unknown illness. When a vagrant asks of her condition, she explains that all is well, that she is dying, but she can fix it. She subsequently begins to regenerate in the style of the revived series as the vagrant flees in terror.  In ""Let's Kill Hitler"", it is revealed that she regenerated into a toddler (Maya Glace-Green). This form later matured into Amy Pond's best friend, Mels (Nina Toussaint-White), who regenerated into her more widely known River Song (Alex Kingston) identity after being shot. In the aforementioned episode, post-regeneration, Melody is immune to a barrage of gunfire due to her surplus regenerative energy. In that same episode, River Song used all her remaining regeneration energy to revive the Doctor; as Amy put it ""You're safe now. Apparently you used all your remaining regenerations in one go. You shouldn't have done that."" She was hospitalised as a result and now no-longer possesses the ability to regenerate. In ""The Husbands of River Song"", its revealed that River possesses an augmented lifespan in her final incarnation, but its never made clear if this is a side-effect of her part-Time Lord physiology or something she obtained from other means.  Other regenerations [ edit ]  In ""Hell Bent"" (2015), while threatened with a gun, the General states to the Doctor that he is currently in his tenth regeneration. The Doctor then shoots him, causing him to regenerate from an old white man into a younger black woman. The General later states that her previous incarnation was her only one as a male.  In ""The Doctor's Daughter"" (2008), the Doctor's DNA is used to create the titular ""daughter"" Jenny (Georgia Moffett), who displays many but not all Time Lord traits. In the episode's close, she is shot in the chest and appears to die. However, long after the Doctor and his companions have departed, she miraculously resurrects and expels energy from her mouth which, ambiguously enough, both resembles regenerative energy and the energy emitted by a planet-restoring plot device in the same episode. The question as to whether this is a true regeneration is left unanswered, since Jenny does not change her appearance.  In The End of Time (2009/2010), the Master attacks the Lord President Rassilon with energy bolts, bringing Rassilon to his knees. By the time of his next appearance in ""Hell Bent"", Rassilon has regenerated into a much older incarnation. In the short story Pandoric's Box, its confirmed that the Master's attack prompted this regeneration as predicted by the Moment.  In the premiere of the 2009 spin-off series K-9, the original K-9 Mark I (Leeson) is reintroduced and destroyed, but subsequently revealed to have been installed with a ""regeneration circuit"". At this point, the traditional K-9 model ""regenerates"" into a more sophisticated-looking CGI model.  Visual effects [ edit ]  Each new regeneration was also radically different from the previous one, even in terms of the visual effects used to represent the moment of regeneration. The very first regeneration was devised and executed by vision mixer Shirley Coward, who had rather unexpectedly come up with a method of achieving the effect electronically. The original plan of the production team was simply that William Hartnell would fall to the floor at the end of The Tenth Planet and pull his cape over his face. Troughton would then appear at the top of The Power of the Daleks, retracting the cloak. Coward's then-innovative vision mix necessitated that Troughton be hastily contracted for The Tenth Planet, part four. The series' first regeneration sequence was then duly recorded on 8 October 1966, with the cliffhanger resolution filmed two weeks later on 22 October. (REF: The Second Doctor Handbook) Older portrayals of regenerations were either a simple fade between two incarnations, a glowing effect that revealed the next incarnation, or one incarnation morphing into the next.  Each subsequent regeneration was then filmed in a variety of different ways, as dictated by the director on that particular episode. Indeed, no two regenerations were particularly similar until the Russell T Davies era. Only BBC Wales Doctor Who attempted to standardise the way regeneration looked. Ever since ""The Parting of the Ways"" (2005), every regeneration has been portrayed as a ""golden glow explosion"" (although the colour of the explosion is fiery orange in ""The Parting of the Ways"" and is milky white in ""Utopia""). Rose was the first to describe this type of regenerations, saying ""I saw him sort of explode, and then you replaced him"" to the Tenth Doctor immediately after the Ninth Doctor regenerated. Also, these regenerations are portrayed as violent discharges that could harm anyone nearby, to the point where the most powerful occurrences, seen in The End of Time and ""The Time of the Doctor"", were able to destroy the Tardis interior and send out a shockwave that destroyed a Dalek ship along with several troops respectively. Each time there was a regeneration with people nearby, either the Doctor or his companions had everyone present get away from the person who was regenerating to avoid them being harmed. In smaller discharges, regeneration was far less harmful and could be emitted from the hand in wisps of golden regeneration energy, which was capable of healing the injuries of others. The subsequent Children in Need Special established that there was residual ""regeneration energy"" in a gaseous state after a transformation which had to be expelled through the mouth. This was seen again in ""The Christmas Invasion"", ""The Eleventh Hour"" and ""The Doctor's Daughter"" — though the latter narrative never made quite clear that Jenny actually regenerated. The Tenth Doctor was seen breathing out gaseous regeneration energy shortly after his transformation, as was the Eleventh Doctor. Consciously holding back the regeneration caused a buildup of energy that resulted in a powerful and violent explosive discharge of regeneration energy. Also, gaining a new cycle of regenerations and Time Lords lives being reset resulted in a shockwave and explosion of regeneration energy with the range of a thermonuclear explosion. Directed regeneration energy discharges could destroy anything in its path, even a Dalek Saucer, while the shock wave destroyed any Dalek troops in the vicinity. The actual regeneration of the Eleventh Doctor, following the wild outburst of regeneration energy that only reset his body, is the first time that the revived series differed from the established process of regeneration. When regenerating into the Twelfth Doctor, the process only includes a brief, mostly off-screen (due to the Doctor leaning back out of the camera) blast of energy.  This visual standardisation has allowed narratives to play around with regeneration. The mere presence of ""regeneration energy"" can now be used to heighten dramatic tension. This visual short cut, unavailable to production teams in the classic era, has been a particular favourite of Steven Moffat, who used the ""golden glow"" liberally throughout the 2011 series; in fact, unlike in the Russell T Davies era, in which nearly every regeneration had subtle differences, every Moffat era regeneration until ""The Time of the Doctor"" is nearly identical. Several of the 2011 episodes used that VFX in a way that wordlessly suggested regeneration.  See also [ edit ]  Notes [ edit ]  References [ edit ]",0

Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.NBC News (@NBCNews) WATCH: White nationalists and counter-protesters clash at Charlottesville rally https://t.co/4qH1yJjrGyThe car attack came about two hours after state police in riot gear had cleared Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue. The city’s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the “alt-right” and the Ku Klux Klan.Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the “Unite the Right” event.One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP“Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,” said Spencer. “We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.”He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: “Jew! Jew! Jew!”Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: “If you take my picture, I’ll cut you. I’m not even kidding.”Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said: “We’re here to counteract white supremacy, and to let people know that it is a system of evil and a system of sin.”Steve Thomas, from Lynchburg, Virginia, who also protested against the far-right groups, said: “I think that what we are witnessing here has always been simmering beneath the surface, and now has been emboldened and enabled by the Trump administration’s politics and rhetoric.”Statue controversyIn February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the Robert Lee statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant.It was part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.In response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by about 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan’s departure, and made 23 arrests.Ben Jacobs and the Associated Press contributed to this report",0

Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents.

To read his full statement, click below!  “My family and I are overwhelmed with this tragedy, but we are sticking together and we’ll get through it,” Chris Soules, 35, told In Touch. “Thank you for reaching out.”  As it’s previously been reported, Bachelor star Chris Soules was driving a 2008 Chevrolet truck when he crashed into a John Deere tractor driven by fellow Iowan farmer Kenneth Mosher. Chris allegedly checked the 66-year-old man’s pulse and called 911 after the disastrous impact, but he later fled the scene by foot and was arrested at his home just five hours later.  Chris was charged with leaving the scene of an accident with a death (a class D felony), but he was released after posting $10,000 bond. Police also reportedly found alcohol in his truck after the crash.  Chris, who was set to appear on the upcoming season of Bachelor In Paradise, is scheduled to appear in court on May 2. He was also ordered to wear an ankle bracelet and hand over his passport.  Before Chris broke his silence, his rep released the following statement, “Chris Soules was involved in an accident Monday evening (April 24) in a rural part of Iowa near his home.

"Over his nearly two-decade career, Nick Cannon has accomplished more than most celebrities—let alone former child stars—do in a lifetime.  Cannon is a rapper, an actor, a comedian, a director, a screenwriter, and a radio and television personality. Whether it’s in the classic Drumline or the less classic Drumline: A New Beat, Cannon is always working.  And while he’s always been a multitasker, the 36-year-old has recently upped the ante when it comes to creative productivity. The star’s recent decision to part ways with America’s Got Talent has left Cannon with even more time to devote to his passion projects, like helming the Wild ’N Out reboot at MTV and working on new music.  One of Cannon’s many passions recently led him to Kingston, Jamaica, where he was inspired by the local dancehall scene. Believing that this story had yet to reach a mainstream audience, Cannon wrote, directed, executive produced, and starred in a musical drama called King of the Dancehall, premiering on YouTube Red on Aug. 2.  Naturally, when Nick Cannon single-handedly wills a dancehall drama into being, that film also happens to star Whoopi Goldberg, Busta Rhymes, Louis Gossett Jr., and Kreesha Turner (and it shoots on location in Jamaica).  Arguably, it was Cannon’s insistence on juggling multiple careers and personas that landed him in hot water earlier this year.  While taping for his Showtime stand-up special, Cannon joked that he was losing his “black card” because of America’s Got Talent. The implication was that Cannon felt somehow controlled or censored by the expectations of the network hosting gig.  NBC allegedly believed that the joke “disparaged their brand,” and may have even gone so far as to threaten Cannon with termination. So the host of the wildly popular summer talent competition quit instead.  “There is no amount of money worth my dignity or my integrity,” Cannon wrote in a subsequent Facebook post. “Not to get too detailed but this isn’t the first time executives have attempted to ‘put me in my place’ for so called unruly actions… I will not stand for it. My moral principles will easily walk away from the millions of dollars they hang over my head.”  In many ways, it’s this insistence on creative autonomy at any cost that truly sets Nick Cannon apart.  During a recent phone call with The Daily Beast, Cannon further articulated his “boss” mentality. We discussed King of the Dancehall, co-parenting with Mariah Carey, and his passion for show-stopping turbans.  So let’s talk about King of the Dancehall, which you wrote, directed, executive produced, and starred in—can you speak on your vision for this project?  More than anything it was just trying to shed light on the subculture of dancehall and Jamaica. I took a trip to Kingston and was inspired by the community so much, and I felt like there was never a story told on a mainstream platform about this world. So I figured they had all the Step Ups and the Dirty Dancings and all that, so why not have something specifically about dancehall? So I wrote it! And put it all together.  Dancehall is definitely having a mainstream moment right now with artists like Drake and Rihanna.  Yeah well that was the thing! I felt like people have been brought on to the culture for quite some time, but were never really paying homage or telling the true story of where everything comes from, the raw ideas or this actually being a lifestyle. So I wanted to do that in a big way so even more people have a chance to—with Drake and Rihanna and the Justin Bieber song—to actually know where that stuff came from.  And how was shooting on location in Jamaica?  It was intense at times because it was just so raw. But we made it happen, it was an incredible experience.  So how does it feel to be doing Wild ’N Out again at MTV?  It’s exciting! More than anything it’s exciting. Again, it’s something I created from nothing, with just an idea. So to see it be so successful and continue to be so successful almost 15 years later and hundreds of episodes later—this generation and the previous generation. And we’re expanding in so many different ways, different verticals, brick and mortar, sports bars, Wild ’N Out comedy clubs. And bringing out all the new talent that you see as well, just giving other people even more opportunities through the Wild ’N Out brand.  In the past you’ve compared Wild ’N Out to Def Comedy Jam and In Living Color, and you’ve certainly helped launch the careers of a bunch of comedians, and black comedians specifically.  Definitely—this was the first place a lot of people were introduced to Katt Williams and Kevin Hart. Even people on SNL like Taran Killam and Pete Davidson, these are people who started their career on Wild ’N Out. It’s been a great platform for young comedians and hip-hop culture. So I take pride in that, to be able to build up young talent and give them a platform.  Wild ’N Out is really unique in that you have these huge celebrities on, and they’re actually willing to be honest and candid. I saw that episode you just did with Blac Chyna, and you guys really went there.  (Laughs.) Yeah, I mean you just got to create an environment of fun. And an environment where no one’s taking themselves too seriously. And so we offer them that. Cause everybody’s handling everything with gravity, and we’re like no, this is an environment where you can address things and address them in a way that says it’s not as serious as everyone makes it. So you can have that fun—and obviously usually I’m the first to take it, I bear the brunt of everyone’s jokes, and so everyone sees it like, “Hey, Nick’s not tripping, so why should anyone else.”  So if a celebrity came with a list of off-limits topics, would you not be about that?  Nah, that happens all the time! Sometimes people will come on and say please don’t say anything about this and this, and we’re sensitive to that. We’re nice and professional people! So if you ask us not to talk about something, we’ll follow the rules. We can be professional!  When all of the stuff was going down with America’s Got Talent, you wrote a statement that touched on the lack of minority executives in the entertainment industry, which is a huge issue, and the challenges of being a black artist in general—do you feel like you’ve seen any sort of progress on that front over the course of your career?  Definitely… We’ve come a long way but we’ve got a long way to go. A lot of times for me it’s more about the mentality. When it comes to talent specifically, they have to “know their place” or “be grateful to have the opportunity,” and that’s not for me at all. I’m more about creating my own, and developing and owning and having equity, not only with studios and brands but with content, and owning IP, not just because that’s where the money is, but that’s where the power is as well. So I just don’t like that employee mentality. I feel like I can’t be an employee anymore, I aim to be a boss and an owner in everything that I do. So when someone puts me in a position where they want to treat me a certain way, and question me, then I have to step up.  At what point did you get so comfortable calling people out and asserting yourself like that?  (Laughs.) You know what, I feel like I’ve always been doing that? I just don’t really care about the consequences, I care about staying true to myself. So it wasn’t like, “Oh I’ve reached a certain point and now I can do it.” I’ve always done it. And luckily I am in a position where even when there are consequences… like I’m no longer working on America’s Got Talent, but there are other jobs, so it doesn’t really phase me.  You mean you don’t need the money.  Right. Pretty much!  OK, shifting from a serious issue to sort of a silly one: The internet went sort of wild when you were spotted at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show wearing a turban—were you surprised that everyone was tweeting about it and all that? Because you’ve been wearing turbans for a while now, right?  Yeah, it’s been a minute. I mean I guess I’m a stylish person, but I never really set out to make a statement and style with it. It’s more of a cultural thing, but I guess it’s part of my style too. I never really give that stuff too much attention—when it comes to being flamboyant, it’s like, why not? Why not rock a pink turban?  Does it upset you when people judge you on the internet, or have you been famous for so long that you actually don’t read the comments?  I definitely read the comments! I read it, laugh at it, and put it on Wild ’N Out, most of the time! That’s great banter. And none of that stuff really phases me because it’s not real life. It’s stuff that you can always laugh at. I always say I’m not worried about other people’s opinions, I just laugh and keep it moving and then do it all over again.  There is constant speculation about how you and your ex-wife (Mariah Carey) have managed to remain such close friends and co-parents even after your split—from the outside, it just looks like a really healthy relationship. How have you managed to stay so close with your ex? What’s the secret?  It’s really just about unconditional love, taking your ego out of the situation and understanding that that’s how it goes. You’ve moved on, but at the end of the day you’ve got to raise children. It’s pretty simple when you think about it.  It doesn’t seem so simple though!  You’re right—you can make it hard or you can just deal with it and embrace it, and I think everybody’s coming from a positive place.  Are you sick of having to constantly address rumors that you’re getting back together?  Yeah, I mean there’s a rumor about that every week, there’s a rumor about who I’m dating. There are so many rumors that I don’t even pay attention to it anymore.  Unless they’re really funny.  Exactly. I try to find the humor in it.  So what other projects are you working on right now?  I’m focusing on music. I have so much free time after America’s Got Talent, that used to take up my entire summer, and so now I’ve just been focusing—I’ve got a hot record out right now with Quavo called “Dream Girl” that’s been shooting up the charts. Aside from that I’ve been DJ’ing and building up the Wild ’N Out brand like I told you, getting all that together and getting ready for the next season, so I’ve been busier than ever. Obviously the film is coming out and then I’m working on another film, doing the same thing, writing, financing, shooting everything but this one takes place in Inglewood, California, and it’s a basketball film about female street ball called She-ball. So that’s kind of cool.  Where do you think your sound is at right now? Because you’ve obviously been making music for a while.  I’m always going to be influenced by gospel music because that’s my favorite type of music. The older stuff I’m always going to be influenced by. But the stuff I’m vibing with, that I’m loving out there right now, is everything from Kehlani, who’s actually one of my artists that I discovered, to everything that’s going on in the hip-hop scene, from Kendrick to Chance to Migos. Those are the guys I’m paying close attention to because that’s who I’m chasing right now.  And are you still enrolled at Howard University?  I am! I’m still trying to figure that out, school starts on the 22nd of August I think, so got to get all of that stuff together.  What are you studying?  I’m majoring in strategic, legal and management communication in the school of communications.  So that’s a lot you have going on!  Always.",0

"Kelly Clarkson & P!nk To Team Up For Exciting Performance for 2017 AMAs Opener  The pair will also perform solo on the show.  Kelly Clarkson and Pink have now added to the already stellar lineup of performances scheduled for the 2017 AMAs. For the first time ever, the two stars will take the stage together to open the awards show. Both women will also have their own solo spotlight performances during the event, with Pink playing the title track from her Beautiful Trauma album and Clarkson taking on a song from her Meaning of Life release and a surprise fan favorite.  Earlier this month, Clarkson expressed wanting to collaborate with Pink at some point in a conversation with EW editor-in-chief Henry Goldblatt at one of the magazine's A-List events. ""I’m a huge fan of Pink,"" Clarkson said, ""I haven’t had the chance yet to work with her. I think if you project it enough, it might happen, right?” Looks like she was right.  Clarkson went on to gush over Pink's latest album Beautiful Trauma, ""I love her because she has done the whole singer-songwriter record she recently did, she does pop, she loves rock."" Clarkson also added that she loves Pink's unapologetic nature, that, “She is who she is, and that’s cool if you like her, and it’s cool if you don’t. I relate to that, so I think that’s why I like her a lot.”  It had been previously announced that both performers would appear on the AMAs as performers, but until now it was not known that the two would collaborate for the first time.

"David Robert Joseph Beckham OBE[4] (; born 2 May 1975) is an English retired professional footballer. He played for Manchester United, Preston North End, Real Madrid, Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain and the England national team, for which he held the appearance record for an outfield player until 2016. He is the first English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States and France. He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies.[5][6]  Known for his range of passing, crossing ability and bending free-kicks as a right winger, Beckham was runner up in the Ballon d'Or, twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year and in 2004 was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[7][8][9] He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2008. A global ambassador for the sport, Beckham is regarded as a British cultural icon.[10][11]  Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 aged 17.[12] With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA Champions League in 1999.[12] He then played four seasons with Real Madrid,[13] winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club.[14] In July 2007 Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy.[15] While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with Milan in 2009 and 2010. He was the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games.[12]  In international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure.[16][17] He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and two UEFA European Championship tournaments, in 2000 and 2004.  Beckham has consistently ranked among the highest earners in football, and in 2013 was listed as the highest-paid player in the world, having earned over $50 million in the previous 12 months.[18] He has been married to Victoria Beckham since 1999 and they have four children.[19] He has been a UNICEF UK ambassador since 2005, and in 2015 he launched 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund.[20] In 2014, MLS announced that Beckham and a group of investors would own an expansion team in Miami, which will begin in 2020.[21]  Early life  Beckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England.[22] He is the son of Sandra Georgina (née West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan ""Ted"" Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, July–September 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married at the London Borough of Hackney in 1969.[23] He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He regularly played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary School and Chingford County High School.[24] In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, ""At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do.""[25] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish,[26] and Beckham has referred to himself as ""half Jewish""[27] and wrote in his autobiography ""I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion"".[28] In his book Both Feet on the Ground, he stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.[29]  His parents were fanatical Manchester United supporters who frequently travelled to Old Trafford from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of Bobby Charlton's football schools in Manchester and won the chance to take part in a training session with Barcelona, as part of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers , which was coached by his father, Stuart Underwood, and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against West Ham United in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club Leyton Orient, Norwich City and attended Tottenham Hotspur's school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for Brimsdown Rovers' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.[30] He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a Youth Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991.[31]  Club career  Manchester United  Youth and early career  Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,[32] Beckham was part of a group of young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.[32]  Manchester United again reached the final of the FA Youth Cup, where they faced Leeds United. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2–0 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4–1 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.[33]  Preston North End (loan)  Beckham then went to Preston North End on loan for part of the 1994–95 season to get some first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, notably scoring directly from a corner kick.[34]  Return to Manchester United  Beckham returned to Manchester and made his Premier League debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995, in a goalless draw against Leeds United. He played four times for United in the league that season, as they finished second behind Blackburn Rovers, missing out on a third successive Premier League title by a single point. He was not in the squad for the FA Cup final with Everton on 20 May, which United lost 1–0, leaving the club without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.[35]  United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as ""Fergie's Fledglings""), which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. When experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis left the club after the end of the 1994–95 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including Darren Anderton, Marc Overmars and Roberto Baggio, but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3–1 defeat at Aston Villa,[36] with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game. However, United recovered from this early season defeat and the young players performed well.[37]  Beckham swiftly established himself as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier League title and FA Cup double that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against Chelsea and also providing the corner from which Eric Cantona scored in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points adrift of leaders Newcastle United at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his teammates had overhauled the Tynesiders at the top of the league by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. Despite playing regularly and to a consistently high standard for Manchester United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before Euro 1996.[38]  ""It changed my life. The ball seemed to be in the air for hours and it all went quiet. Then the ball went in and it just erupted. I was on cloud nine. I just wanted to shake everybody's hand and be out on the pitch for an hour."" —Beckham on the goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon in August 1996 that made him a household name.[39]  At the beginning of the 1996–97 season, Beckham was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the Premier League season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against Wimbledon. With United leading 2–0, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.[40]  When Beckham scored his famous goal, he was wearing Adidas Predator boots customised for Charlie Miller (""Charlie"" was embroidered on the boots) which had been given to Beckham by mistake.[41] In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002, the British public voted the goal No.18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[42] During the 1996–97 season, Beckham became an automatic first-choice player at Manchester United, helping them to retain the Premier League championship, and was voted PFA Young Player of the Year by his peers.[43] Manchester United started the 1997–98 season well but erratic performances in the second half of the season saw United finish second behind Arsenal.[44]  In the 1998–99 season, he was part of the United team that won the treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League, a unique feat in English football.[45] There had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but Beckham decided to stay at Manchester United.[46]  To ensure they would win the Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham. There were reports suggesting that the opposition would allow themselves to be beaten to prevent their local rivals Arsenal from retaining the title, but Tottenham took an early lead in the match.[45] Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 25 yards out into the top left corner of the goal and United went on to win the match and the league.[45]  Beckham played in central midfield in United's win over Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, since United's first string centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane were suspended for the match.[45] United were losing the match 1–0 at the end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham.[45] Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to him finishing runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[47]  Despite Beckham's achievements in the 1998–99 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against Necaxa. It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him,[48] but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in 1999–2000 by an 18-point margin, after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.[49]  By the early 2000s, the relationship between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had gastroenteritis, but Ferguson was furious when Victoria Beckham was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages – then £50,000) and dropping him for a crucial match against United's rivals Leeds United. He later criticised Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been ""fair to his teammates""[50] Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin.  ""He was never a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment, his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part.""' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.[51]  He was a key player in United's third successive league title in 2000–01, only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. He scored nine goals that season, all in the Premier League.  On 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against Deportivo de La Coruña, breaking the second metatarsal bone in his left foot. There was speculation in the British media that the injury might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was Argentine Aldo Duscher, and England and Argentina were due to meet in that year's World Cup.[52] The injury prevented Beckham from playing for United for the rest of the season and they missed out on the Premier League title to Arsenal (also being knocked out of the Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen on away goals in the semi-finals), but he signed a three-year contract in May, following months of negotiations with the club, mostly concerning extra payments for his image rights. The income from his new contract, and his many endorsement deals, made him the highest-paid player in the world at the time.[53] Despite the injury, 2001–02 was arguably Beckham's best season as a United player; he scored 11 goals in 28 league games, and a total of 16 goals in 42 games in all competitions, the best of his career.  Following an injury early in the 2002–03 season, Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw[54][55][56][57][58] [59] or kicked a boot that struck Beckham over the eye, causing a cut that required stitches. The incident led to a great deal of transfer speculation involving Beckham, with bookmakers offering odds on whether he or Ferguson would be first to leave the club.[60] Although the team had started the season badly, their results improved greatly from December onwards and they won the league, with Beckham managing a total of 11 goals in 52 games in all competitions. He was still a first-choice player for England, however, and was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to football on 13 June 2003.[61]  Beckham had made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals. He also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one European Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years. By this stage, he was their joint second longest serving player behind Ryan Giggs (having joined them at the same time as Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes).  Real Madrid  ""He is a great player who is going to become part of the club's great history. He is a man of our times and a symbol of modern-day stardom and what is certain is Real Madrid have signed Beckham because he's a great footballer and a very dedicated professional. His team spirit is unsurpassed and he is one of the best English players of all-time and if only because of that he is with us."" —Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez during Beckham's unveiling.[62]  As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona[63] and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer,[64] but instead he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for €37 million on a four-year contract.[65] Beckham was the latest signing in the Galácticos era of global stars signed by club president Florentino Pérez every summer.[66] The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham.[67] Though announced in mid-June, the transfer was completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club, after Laurie Cunningham and Steve McManaman. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt by club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano.[68] Although Beckham had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and England, he was unable to wear it at Madrid as it was assigned to club captain Raúl. He decided to wear number 23 instead, citing his admiration of basketball player Michael Jordan, who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason behind his decision.[69]  Beckham (top) and Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid in August 2003  In the week before Beckham's presentation, Real named Carlos Queiroz as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham was reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid, since Queiroz had spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons. The presence of a global marketing icon such as Beckham, however, made this particular tour a financial smash for los Merengues.[70]  Shortly after his transfer to Real, Beckham also ended his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of SFX Europe, who had guided him through his career until that point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with Simon Fuller and his company 19 Entertainment, which already managed the career of Victoria.[71] Beckham also appointed close friend Terry Byrne to be his personal manager.[72][73]  In late August 2003, Real Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup over two legs versus RCD Mallorca, with Beckham scoring the final goal in a 3–0 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing in a star-laden team which included three former FIFA World Player of the Year recipients, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Luís Figo, in addition to Roberto Carlos, Raúl and Iker Casillas, Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5–3–2 formation, with two fullbacks Míchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos, often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man midfield, alongside Zidane and Figo.[74]  Real Madrid were runners-up in the Copa del Rey, were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning the team, whose president Pérez expected them to win either the Spanish league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of petrol. Victoria and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended the man before he reached the house.[75]  The league season began with new head coach José Antonio Camacho at the helm, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant Mariano García Remón took over on temporary basis as Real's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling Ben Thatcher in an England match against Wales to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next caution, and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. The Football Association asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had ""made a mistake"" and apologised.[76] He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against Valencia. Having received a yellow card, he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal.  By Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second position in the league, García Remón was dismissed, and Vanderlei Luxemburgo became the new head coach. However, the well-travelled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in second position. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against Getafe CF. A day later Luxemburgo was sacked and was replaced by Juan Ramón López Caro. By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga in number of assists.  Beckham warming up with Real Madrid in August 2006  During the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards.[77] Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005–06 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and only reached the last 16 in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal. The season also marked the end of an era for the club as Pérez resigned his post as president in January 2006, with Vicente Boluda named as replacement on an interim basis until the end of the season.  The summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as the club's presidential elections were held. Ramón Calderón became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials who served under the previous president was kept, including head coach López Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello, Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier José Antonio Reyes was normally preferred on the right wing. Of the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contractual negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatović announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.[78]  On 11 January 2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for the LA Galaxy beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he continued to train with the team.[79] A few days later, while speaking to the students at Villanueva University Center in Madrid, Calderón said that Beckham is ""going to Hollywood to be half a film star"", adding ""our technical staff were right not to extend his contract, which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except Los Angeles"".[80]  About a month later, however, Capello backtracked on his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match against Real Sociedad on 10 February 2007. The player immediately repaid his head coach's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free kick, as Real Madrid eventually recorded a 2–1 victory.[81] In his final UEFA Champions League appearance for the club, Real Madrid were knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the round-of-16 stage (on the away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. Beckham played a pivotal role in all three Madrid goals in the home game, with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn describing his performance as ""world class"".[82]  Beckham during his last season with Real Madrid  On 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, a 3–1 win over Mallorca which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. With Real down 0–1, Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by José Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals, leading the team to that season's La Liga title, their first since Beckham had signed with them and 30th overall in the club's history. Although Real and Barçelona both finished level on points, Madrid took the title because of their superior head-to-head record, capping a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham.[83] With his wife and children, along with celebrity friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, watching from a luxury box at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, it was only Beckham's second piece of silverware since he joined the famous club.[83]  Towards the end of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after successfully fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful.[84] Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival in the United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.[85]  A month after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, Forbes magazine reported that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600 million during Beckham's four years at the club.[86]  LA Galaxy  I'm coming there not to be a superstar. I'm coming there to be part of the team, to work hard and to hopefully win things. With me, it's about football. I'm coming there to make a difference. I'm coming there to play football ... I'm not saying me coming over to the States is going to make soccer the biggest sport in America. That would be difficult to achieve. Baseball, basketball, American football, they've been around. But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think I could make a difference.[87] Beckham on going to America    Beckham's involvement with Major League Soccer (MLS) began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side LA Galaxy. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the 2007 MLS SuperDraft.[88]  Beckham scores his first goal for LA Galaxy with a trademark free-kick.  The announcement made top news all across the globe. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250 million,[89] the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment).[90] To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5 million in total or $6.5 million per year.[72][91]  The high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with Herbalife nutrition company worth US$20 million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home ground, the Home Depot Center).[92] Even the LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) saw an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as China, where the company had been working aggressively in Shanghai and Beijing for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO Tim Leiweke put it as follows: ""Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed"".[93]  In the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an MLS expansion franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25 million whenever he stopped playing in the league[94] – an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.[92] In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2 million home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills.[95]  Beckham (with a blue captain's armband) became LA Galaxy captain immediately upon joining the team  Beckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the famous Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.[96] Beckham chose to wear number 23. It was announced that Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over 250,000 prior to this formal introduction.[97]  In parallel, Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in America. He made the cover of Sports Illustrated, a few weeks earlier Adidas launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign ""Fútbol meets Football"" starring Beckham and NFL running back Reggie Bush, and W magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by Steven Klein. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air David Beckham: New Beginnings documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus Chelsea, which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by Simon Fuller, who in turn has a business relationship with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400 million headquarters in Century City with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.[98] That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special Victoria Beckham: Coming to America aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.[99]  Beckham during a LA Galaxy game in November 2007  On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0–1 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer.[100] With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.[95] As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.[95]  The day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's Museum of Contemporary Art, formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood A-listers, the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.[101]  Beckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le Méridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.[102]  Beckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008  Two weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute.[103] Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pavón failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Landon Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip was at New England Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium's artificial surface.  Beckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the SuperLiga semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.[104] He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2–0 victory, and a place in the North American SuperLiga final versus Pachuca on 29 August.  During the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an MRI scan revealing that he had sprained his medial collateral ligament and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1–0 loss to the Chicago Fire. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league). Beckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.[105] Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the San Jose Earthquakes in the ninth minute.[106] On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the Kansas City Wizards 3–1, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70 yards out. The goal marked the second time in Beckham's career that he had scored from his own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.[107] Overall, however, the Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.  Milan (loan)  In 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under Fabio Capello led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the World Cup qualifying matches in 2009. On 30 October 2008, Milan announced that Beckham was to join them on loan from 7 January 2009.[108] Despite this and other speculation, Beckham made it clear that the move in no way signalled his intent to leave MLS and announced his intent to return to the Galaxy in time for the start of the 2009 season in March.[109] Many at Milan both within and outside of the club expressed serious reservations about the transfer, with it considered by some players no more than a marketing move.[110]  Beckham was unveiled at Milan's training facility by the club's chief executive Adriano Galliani on 20 December 2008. The player chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by Christian Vieri, as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by Alexandre Pato and club vice captain Massimo Ambrosini, respectively. After his physical, Beckham was reportedly told by a club doctor that he believed he could continue playing football for another five years, up to the age of 38.[111] The day after his unveiling, Beckham was brought to San Siro where he got introduced to home fans by walking out on the pitch before the league match versus Udinese and proclaiming ""Forza Milan"" over the public address system.[112] Afterwards, he and wife Victoria watched from a luxury box as Milan won 5–1.[113]  ""On the pitch, Beckham sees everything before everyone else. His vision of play is better now than during his time in Manchester. He is slower but much stronger tactically and technically. He is very intelligent and works a lot."" —A.C. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti on Beckham's condition at 33 years old.[114]  Playing on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar Kaká in addition to several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers – 28-year-old Ronaldinho, and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo – as well as club veterans Paolo Maldini, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli, Gianluca Zambrotta, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive debut for the rossoneri in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 2009, playing 89 minutes of the 2–2 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio Olimpico.[115] Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play him from the start.[116] Going into Beckham's home debut versus Fiorentina a week later, all the talk was around Kaká being the target of a reported £100 million transfer bid by Manchester City.[117] Beckham turned in another understated performance on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1–0 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kaká, imploring him to stay.[118]  A noticeably older team, Ancelotti-coached Milan was proving a good fit for the 33-year-old Englishman. He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4–1 victory over Bologna on 25 January, his third appearance for the club.[119] Though Beckham was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar fee for him. The rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when Beckham stated that he was seeking a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his England career through the 2010 World Cup. Milan, however, failed to match Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10–15 million range.[120]  Still, negotiations continued during a month of speculation.[121] On 2 March, the Los Angeles Times reported that Beckham's loan had been extended through mid-July.[122] This was later confirmed by Beckham, revealing what was described as a unique ""timeshare"" deal, in which Beckham would play with L.A. from mid-July till the end of the 2009 MLS season.[123]  Return to Galaxy  After his return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying ""Go home fraud"", and ""Part-time player"".[124] The Galaxy, however, had a much more successful season than in previous years, rising from third to first in the Western Conference during Beckham's time with them. He remained a key part of the squad which saw Galaxy win the 2009 Western Conference final after a 2–0 overtime victory over the Houston Dynamo.[125] In the final on 22 November 2009, the Galaxy lost to Real Salt Lake by 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. Beckham also scored in the shootout.[126]  Return to Milan (loan)  In November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning in January 2010.[127] On 6 January 2010, Beckham made a winning return in a Milan shirt, playing 75 minutes of a 5–2 victory over Genoa.[128] On 16 February 2010, Beckham played against Manchester United for the first time since he left the club in 2003. He played 76 minutes of the match at the San Siro – which ended 3–2 to Manchester United – before being substituted for Clarence Seedorf.[129]  Beckham returned to Old Trafford for the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2.[130] Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.[131]  In Milan's next game, against Chievo, Beckham suffered a torn left Achilles tendon,[132] causing him to miss the World Cup as well as the MLS season due to the injury, which took him out of action for the next five months. Doctor Sakari Orava performed surgery on Beckham's tendon in Turku, Finland, on 15 March 2010.[133] After the operation, Orava affirmed that, ""it went quite fine. The prognosis is he needs a rehabilitation for the next few months, and the plaster cast is the next six to eight weeks. I would say that [it will be] maybe four months before he's running, but six months before he's jumping and kicking.""[134]  Second return to Galaxy  Beckham in 2010  On 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the Galaxy's 3–1 win over Columbus Crew.[135] On 4 October, Beckham scored a trademark free kick in a 2–1 win over Chivas USA to mark his first goal in 2010.[136] On 24 October, Beckham scored his second goal of the season in the Galaxy's 2–1 win over FC Dallas which secured them their second successive Western Conference title and first MLS Supporters' Shield since 2002.[137]  During January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, Beckham trained with Tottenham Hotspur. Rumours in the media claimed that the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, according to Spurs manager Harry Redknapp, the move was blocked by Galaxy, who wanted a full final season from their number 23.[138] As a result, he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three years earlier. With Beckham playing in the centre of midfield, the Galaxy won the 2011 MLS cup.[139]  MLS Cup champion  Beckham with LA Galaxy in 2012  On 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4–1 victory over Sporting Kansas City.[140] On 9 July, Beckham scored directly from a corner in a 2–1 win over Chicago Fire, repeating a feat he also achieved while playing for Preston North End.[141]  After having his best season with the Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite group of players to have won league titles in three countries, when Los Angeles won their third MLS Cup against the Houston Dynamo, winning 1–0 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and fellow designated player Robbie Keane.[139][142]  Following the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive Supporters' Shield, having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011. Despite being 36, he stated that he did not intend to retire. Beckham was heavily linked with Paris Saint-Germain, but on 18 January 2012, Galaxy announced Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles.[143][144][145][146] In May 2012, Beckham and his victorious teammates were received by President of the United States Barack Obama at the White House.[147]  Beckham helped the Galaxy to a fourth-place finish in the MLS Western Conference 2012 regular season with Beckham scoring seven goals and adding nine assists. The Galaxy defeated Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders FC and then 3–1 over the Houston Dynamo to retain the MLS Cup.[148] He was subbed off in the 89th minute for Marcelo Sarvas and was given a standing ovation at their home venue.[149] Beckham had earlier announced that the 2012 MLS Cup Final would be his final game with the Galaxy despite having another year remaining on his contract.[150][151]  Paris Saint-Germain and retirement  On 31 January 2013, ahead of the transfer deadline it was announced that Beckham would be undergoing a medical with Paris Saint-Germain ahead of a potential move to the Ligue 1 side.[152] Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club later that afternoon and confirmed that his entire salary during his time in Paris would be donated to a local children's charity.[153] His PSG debut came on 24 February 2013, when he came off the bench in the 76th minute in a Ligue 1 home match against Marseille. This made him the 400th player in the history of the club.[154] On 12 May 2013, Beckham won a fourth different top flight winners' medal after PSG beat Lyon 1–0 to claim the Ligue 1 title.[155]  On 16 May 2013, Beckham announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of that year's French football season.[156][157] Following his decision to retire at the end of the 2012–13 season, Beckham was given specially designed boots in the colours of the Union Jack to wear in his final game. These boots had the names of his wife and children stitched on to them. On 18 May 2013, Beckham was made captain in his final home game against Brest.[158] In this game, Beckham assisted a goal by Matuidi from a corner. Beckham was subbed after 80 minutes, receiving hugs from his fellow players and manager, as well as a standing ovation from fans.[158] PSG went on to win the game 3–1.[158]  International career  Beckham as England captain  Beckham made his first appearance for the England national team on 1 September 1996, in a World Cup qualifying match against Moldova.[159]  Beckham had played in all of England's qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup and was part of the England squad at the World Cup finals in France,[160] but the team's manager Glenn Hoddle publicly accused him of not concentrating on the tournament,[161] and he did not start in either of England's first two games. He was picked for the third game against Colombia and scored with a bending 30-yard free kick in a 2–0 victory, which was his first goal for England.[162]  In the second round (last 16) of that competition, he received a red card in England's match against Argentina.[163] Beckham, after having been fouled by Diego Simeone, kicked Simeone while lying on the floor, striking him on the calf muscle.[163] Sports Illustrated was critical of the Argentinians' theatrics in that incident, stating that Simeone first delivered a ""heavy-handed challenge"" on Beckham and then ""fell like a ton of bricks"" when Beckham retaliated.[164] Simeone later admitted to trying to get Beckham sent off by over-reacting to the kick and then, along with other members of his team, urging the referee to send Beckham off.[165] The match finished in a draw and England were eliminated in a penalty shootout. Many supporters and journalists blamed him for England's elimination and he became the target of criticism and abuse, including the hanging of an effigy outside a London pub, and the Daily Mirror printing a dartboard with a picture of him centred on the bullseye. Beckham also received death threats after the World Cup.[166]  The abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters peaked during England's 3–2 defeat by Portugal in Euro 2000, a match where Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him throughout the match.[167] Beckham responded by raising his middle finger and, while the gesture attracted some criticism, many of the newspapers that had previously encouraged his vilification asked their readers to stop abusing him.[168]  On 15 November 2000, following Kevin Keegan's resignation as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by the caretaker manager Peter Taylor, and then kept the role under new manager Sven-Göran Eriksson.[169]  ""We've played two and a half minutes of stoppage time. England trail by 2 goals to 1. Beckham could raise the roof here with a goal ... I don't believe it! David Beckham scores the goal to take England all the way to the World Cup Finals! ... Give that man a Knighthood!"" —Television commentary on Beckham's stoppage time 30-yard curling free-kick against Greece in the 2002 World Cup qualifying game in October 2001.[170]  Beckham played a major role in helping England qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in an impressive 5–1 victory over Germany in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to national hero happened in England's final qualifying game against Greece on 6 October 2001.[171] England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2–1 with little time remaining. When Teddy Sheringham was fouled eight yards outside the Greek penalty area, England were awarded a free-kick and Beckham ensured England's qualification with a curling strike of the kind that had become his trademark.[171] Beckham was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2001, and finished runner-up, to Luís Figo of Portugal, for the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[172]  Beckham was partially fit by the time of the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea, and played in the first match against Sweden. After the events of four years earlier, Beckham achieved a degree of revenge over Argentina by scoring the winning goal with a penalty, causing Argentina to fail to qualify for the knockout stage.[173] England defeated Denmark in the second round with Beckham providing an assist in a 3–0 win. England were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Brazil after Ronaldinho scored the winner.[174]  The following month, at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Beckham escorted Kirsty Howard as she presented the Jubilee Baton to the Queen. Beckham played in all of England's matches at Euro 2004. He had a penalty saved in England's 2–1 defeat to France and missed another in a penalty shootout in the quarter-final match against Portugal.[175] England lost the shootout thus going out of the competition.[175]  Beckham became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in January 2005 and was involved in promoting London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games.[176] In October 2005, Beckham's sending off against Austria made him the first England captain to be sent off and the first player to be sent off twice while playing for England. He captained England for the 50th time in a friendly international against Argentina the following month.[169]  In England's opening game at the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an own-goal by Carlos Gamarra as England won 1–0. In England's next match, played against Trinidad and Tobago on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute led to a Peter Crouch goal, which put England into the lead 1–0. Beckham gave another assist to Steven Gerrard. In the end they won 2–0. He was named Man of the Match by tournament sponsor Budweiser.  During England's second round match against Ecuador, Beckham scored from a free kick in the 59th minute, becoming the first English player to score in three separate World Cups,[177] and giving England a 1–0 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England.[177] In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3–1), the score having been 0–0 after extra time.[178] After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not being able to play, being in tears at one point.[179]  A day after England were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement in a news conference that he had stepped down as England captain,[169] stating, ""It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, having been captain for 58 of my 95[180] games, I feel the time is right to pass on the armband as we enter a new era under Steve McClaren."" (Beckham had won 94 caps up to that point.) He was succeeded by Chelsea captain John Terry.[181]  Having stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach Steve McClaren on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was ""looking to go in a different direction"" with the team, and that Beckham ""wasn't included within that.""[182] McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future. Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kieran Richardson, and the World Cup alternative to Beckham, Aaron Lennon, were all included, although McClaren eventually opted to employ Steven Gerrard in that role.  On 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against Brazil in England's first match at the new Wembley Stadium and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain John Terry. It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer Diego equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia, Beckham sent two trademark assists for Michael Owen and Peter Crouch, helping England to prevail 3–0. Beckham had assisted in three of England's four total goals in those two games,[183] and he stated his desire to continue to play for England after his move to Major League Soccer.  On 22 August 2007, Beckham played in a friendly for England against Germany, becoming the first to play for England while with a non-European club team.[184] On 21 November 2007, Beckham earned his 99th cap against Croatia, setting up a goal for Peter Crouch to tie the game at 2–2. Following the 2–3 loss, England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 Finals. Despite this, Beckham said that he has no plans to retire from international football and wanted to continue playing for the national team.[185] After being passed over by new England coach and Beckham's former manager at Real Madrid, Fabio Capello, for a friendly against Switzerland which would have given him his hundredth cap; Beckham admitted that he was not in shape at the time, as he had not played a competitive match in three months.[186]  On 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the England squad by Capello for the friendly against France in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long-term future in his side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup.[187] On 11 May 2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31-man England squad to face the United States at Wembley Stadium on 28 May before the away fixture with Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June. Beckham was honoured before the match by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from Bobby Charlton, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at half-time for David Bentley, the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision.[188] In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match was the first time since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham. In two years, he had gone from being dropped completely from the England squad to being reinstated (though temporarily) as England captain.[189]  During the 2010 World Cup Qualifier against Belarus in which England won 3–1 in Minsk, Beckham came off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's third-most-capped player in history, overtaking Bobby Charlton in the process. On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with Bobby Moore's record of 108 caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for Stewart Downing in a friendly match against Spain.[190] On 28 March 2009, Beckham surpassed Moore to hold the record outright when he came on as a substitute in a friendly against Slovakia, providing the assist for a goal from Wayne Rooney in the process.[191] In all, Beckham had made 16 appearances out of a possible 20 for England under Capello until his ruptured Achilles tendon of March 2010 ruled him out of selection for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[192] His last game for England before injury had been on 14 October 2009 as a substitute in England's last World Cup qualifying game, which ended England 3 – 0 Belarus.[192]  After a poor performance from England at the World Cup, Capello remained as manager but was under pressure to revamp the England squad for the imminent UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign. He unveiled a new team at the next England match, a home friendly game against Hungary on 11 August 2010, with Beckham still unavailable for selection but aiming for a return to playing in MLS by the following month.[192] In the post-match interview, Capello said of the prospect of the now 35-year-old Beckham playing any future competitive matches for England, that ""I need to change it. David is a fantastic player but I think we need new players for the future"", referring to the new players that play in Beckham's right midfield position, including Theo Walcott and Adam Johnson, adding ""This is the future of the team under Fabio Capello or another manager.""[192] He said that Beckham may be selected for one last friendly game, stating, ""If he is fit, I hope we will play one more game here at Wembley so the fans can say goodbye."" In response to the comments, Beckham's agent released a statement reiterating Beckham's position that he had no desire to retire from international football, and would always make himself available for selection for England if fit and if needed.[192] He remains 10 caps short of the record number of 125 caps by goalkeeper Peter Shilton, for a player of any position.[192]  Beckham was named in the provisional squad to represent the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Olympics.[193] He was not included in the final selection by manager Stuart Pearce.[194]  Approach to training and discipline  Training and praise from managers  ""David Beckham is Britain's finest striker of a football not because of God-given talent but because he practises with a relentless application that the vast majority of less gifted players wouldn't contemplate."" —Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.[195]  Beckham was a product of Sir Alex Ferguson's hard-working approach at Manchester United, and was renowned for his long-range passing, crossing ability, and bending free-kicks as a right winger. Ferguson noted that Beckham ""practised with a discipline to achieve an accuracy that other players wouldn't care about.""[196][197][198] Beckham reportedly spent hours practising his free kicks after training sessions had ended.[195]  Beckham maintained his training routine at Real Madrid and even when his relationship with management was strained in early 2007, Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón and manager Fabio Capello praised Beckham for maintaining his professionalism and commitment to the club.[199][200] Beckham's Real Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos regarded Beckham to be the best free-kick exponent he had ever seen.[201] Two of the best free kick exponents of their generation, Roberto Carlos commented on the dilemma the team faced when they won a free kick on the edge of the penalty area: ""I would stand on one side and Beckham on the other but I wanted to see Beckham take the free-kick because it's beautiful how he hits the ball.""[201]  In May 2013, asked about how he wanted to be remembered in his retirement, Beckham said, ""I just want people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate about the game, someone that – every time I stepped on the pitch – I've given everything that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how I look back on it and hope people will see me.""[195]  Discipline  Beckham was the first England player ever to collect two red cards, and the first England captain to be sent off.[202] Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 World Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying face down on the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.[163]  He amassed 41 yellow cards and four red cards in his time at Real Madrid; all four reds came in La Liga.[203] He received one red card while at Paris Saint-Germain, picked up in injury time in a match against Evian on 28 April 2013.[204] Between 2000 and 2013, Beckham played 420 competitive games for England, Milan, LA Galaxy, Manchester United, Real Madrid and PSG, and received seven red cards, one every 60 matches on average.[203]  David Beckham Academy  Beckham Academy in London  In 2005, Beckham founded the David Beckham Academy football school, operating from two sites, in London and Los Angeles. It was announced in late 2009 that both would close.[205] A mobile academy is being developed by Beckham, to travel around the UK and further afield.[206]  Major League Soccer team in Miami  On 5 February 2014, MLS announced that Beckham had exercised his option to buy a MLS expansion team for $25 million, which he had received as part of the contract he signed with the LA Galaxy in 2007.[94] The ownership group, led by Beckham, originally hoped the Miami-based team would begin play in 2016 or 2017.[21] After delays getting a stadium deal completed, MLS announced in January 2018 that the team had been approved and would likely begin play in 2020.[207]  Personal life  Beckham and his wife Victoria at the 2007 British Grand Prix at Silverstone  In 1997, Beckham started dating Victoria Adams, after she attended a Manchester United match. She was famously known as ""Posh Spice"" of the pop music group Spice Girls, one of the world's top pop groups at the time, and his team was also enjoying a great run of success. Therefore, their relationship instantly attracted a great deal of media attention. The couple were dubbed ""Posh and Becks"" by the media. He proposed to her on 24 January 1998 in a restaurant in Cheshunt, England.  On 4 July 1999, they married at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland. Beckham's teammate Gary Neville was the best man, and the couple's infant son, Brooklyn, was the ring bearer. The media were kept away from the ceremony, as the Beckhams had an exclusive deal with OK! Magazine, but newspapers were still able to obtain photographs showing them sitting on golden thrones.[208] 437 staff were employed for the wedding reception, which was estimated to have cost £500,000.[209]  David and Victoria Beckham have four children: sons Brooklyn Joseph (born 4 March 1999 at Portland Hospital, London),[210] Romeo James (born 1 September 2002 at Portland Hospital, London),[211] Cruz David (born 20 February 2005 at Ruber International Hospital, Madrid),[212] and daughter Harper Seven (born 10 July 2011 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles).[213] Elton John is godfather to Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham; their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley.[214] Beckham's three sons have all played football in the Arsenal Academy.[215] Like their father, Brooklyn and Romeo have both done modelling work and been named among GQ's best dressed British men.[216] Brooklyn previously played football for Arsenal U16,[215] but was released at the end of the 2014–15 season.[217]  In his early Manchester United career, Beckham lived in a four-bedroom house in Worsley that he bought directly from the property developer as a 20-year-old in 1995.[218] In 1999, shortly after his wedding he and Victoria bought a country house set in 24 acres in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, which the media nicknamed ""Beckingham Palace"".[219]  Beckham suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which he says makes him ""have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs."" Victoria Beckham claims, ""If you open our fridge, it's all co-ordinated down either side. We've got three fridges – food in one, salad in another and drinks in the third. In the drinks one, everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans, he'll throw one away because it has to be an even number.""[220]  In April 2004, the British tabloid News of the World carried claims by Beckham's former personal assistant Rebecca Loos that he and Loos had an extramarital affair.[221][222] A week later, the Malaysian-born Australian model Sarah Marbeck claimed that she had slept with Beckham on two occasions. Beckham dismissed both accusations as ""ludicrous"".[223]  In September 2010, Beckham announced that he was making a court application against prostitute Irma Nici and several others over claims in the magazine In Touch that he had sex with her.[224] Although the magazine later accepted that the allegations against Beckham were untrue, his court application was dismissed under US freedom of speech laws.[225][226]  Beckham's fame extends beyond the pitch; in much of the world his name is ""as instantly recognisable as that of multinational companies like Coca-Cola and IBM.""[227] Beckham's relationship and marriage to Victoria, who has been famous in her own right as part of the Spice Girls, contributed to his celebrity beyond football.  Beckham became known as a fashion icon, and together with Victoria, the couple became lucrative spokespeople sought after by clothing designers, health and fitness specialists, fashion magazines, perfume and cosmetics manufacturers, hair stylists, exercise promoters, and spa and recreation companies. One example is a line of aftershave and fragrances called David Beckham Instinct.[228] In 2002, Beckham was hailed as the ultimate ""metrosexual"" by the man who invented the term[229] and has been described as such by numerous other articles since.[230]  The Beckhams were paid $13.7 million in 2007 to launch his fragrance line in the United States[231] In the world of fashion, David has already appeared on the covers of many magazines. United States covers have included the men's magazine Details, and with his wife for the August 2007 issue of W.[232] According to Google, ""David Beckham"" was searched for more than any other sports topic on their site in 2003 and 2004.[233][234] According to Ask Jeeves, Beckham ranked third, after Britney Spears and Osama bin Laden, among subjects most searched for by British users of that site in the first decade of the 2000s.[235]  Upon their arrival in Los Angeles on 12 July 2007, the night before Beckham's formal introduction, Los Angeles International Airport was filled with paparazzi and news reporters.[236] On the next night, Victoria appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno to talk about their move to LA, and presented Leno with a number 23 Galaxy jersey with his own name on the back. Victoria also talked about her NBC TV show Victoria Beckham: Coming to America.[237] On 22 July, a private welcoming party was held for the couple at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. A-list celebrities attending included Steven Spielberg, Jim Carrey, George Clooney, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Oprah Winfrey.[238]  Beckham's many endorsement deals make him one of the most recognisable athletes throughout the world. Having worn Adidas football boots from the start of his career (notably Adidas Predator), in 2003 he signed a $160 million lifetime contract with Adidas, earning nearly half the money upfront, and will continue to earn percentages of profits on all of his branded Adidas products.[239] He had a 10-year collaboration with Pepsi Co. that expired in 2009.[240] He has also promoted The Walt Disney Company theme parks.[241]  Beckham with United States First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House, March 2012  Beckham has several eponymous video games, including Go! Go! Beckham! Adventure on Soccer Island, a platform game for the Game Boy Advance, and David Beckham Soccer, a football game for a number of platforms,[242][243] and he was brand ambassador for exercise video game EA Sports Active 2.[244] Beckham featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was on the cover for the International edition of FIFA 98.[245]  During his playing career (which ended in May 2013), Beckham generated an estimated £1 billion in shirt and boot sales.[246] In 2006, Lloyd's of London insured his legs for £100m, at the time he was playing for Real Madrid.[247][248] In March 2015 Beckham had the third highest social media rank in the world among sportspeople, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, with over 52 million Facebook fans.[249]  At the closing ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Beckham, Jimmy Page and Leona Lewis represented Britain during the handover segment for the 2012 Games to be held in London. Beckham rode a London double-decker bus into the stadium and Page and Lewis performed ""Whole Lotta Love"".[250] Beckham visited Afghanistan in May 2010 for a morale-boosting visit to British troops fighting the Taliban insurgency.[251][252] The appearance of Beckham as well as British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Defence Secretary Liam Fox was believed to have prompted a Taliban attack on Kandahar airfield.[253][254]  Chinese authorities appointed Beckham as global ambassador for Chinese football in March 2013. After numerous officials had been banned for match-fixing, and the Chinese Super League had failed to retain the services of well-known international names, Beckham's role was to help improve the image of the game and raise its profile both in China and abroad.[255]  From 14 July 2013, Beckham started appearing in adverts for BSkyB advertising their Sky Sports coverage via the Sky Go app.[256] In January 2014, Beckham appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on NBC in the U.S, and in March he made a guest appearance in the BBC's Sport Relief special of Only Fools and Horses.[257] He was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed British men in 2015.[216]  Beckham was announced as the new Ambassadorial president of the British Fashion Council on 11 May 2018.[258] Prior to the June 2018 vote by FIFA member nations for selecting the hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Beckham endorsed the North American bid (Canada, Mexico and the United States).[259]  Charitable work  Beckham has supported UNICEF since his days at Manchester United and in January 2005, the English national team captain became a Goodwill Ambassador with a special focus on UNICEF's Sports for Development program.[20] In 2012, he met with UK Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street to call for more action to help children affected by malnutrition around the world.[260] In 2015, his tenth year as a UNICEF Ambassador, Beckham launched 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund to help protect children in danger.[20] In June 2015 he visited Siem Reap in Cambodia, where he met with child victims of violence.[20] Beckham has pledged his support for the Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS campaign. He is a former patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[261] In 2013, he also donated all his £3.4 million salary taken from Paris Saint-Germain to two children's charities in France.[262] Beckham has been supporting the charity named Help For Heroes for many years whose aim is to help soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghan wars.[263]  On 17 January 2007, Rebecca Johnstone, a 19-year-old cancer patient from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, received a surprise phone call from Beckham. After the conversation, he sent her a Real Madrid jersey with his signature on it. Rebecca died on 29 January 2007.[264] On 1 July 2007, Beckham appeared as a speaker at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death.[265] Proceeds from the concert went to Diana's charities as well as to charities of which her sons Princes William and Harry are patrons.[266][267]  Beckham is a founding member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with Andy Murray at Wembley Stadium. Beckham also appeared in a 2007 public service announcement for Malaria No More U.S, advertising the need for inexpensive bed nets. The TV spot aired in the United States on Fox Networks, including Fox Soccer Channel, and can also be seen on YouTube.[268]  Since joining Major League Soccer, Beckham has been a very public advocate in the United States for related charities such as ""MLS W.O.R.K.S."" On 17 August 2007, he conducted a youth clinic in Harlem, along with other current and former MLS players. This was in advance of his first New York City area match the following day against the New York Red Bulls. That team's Jozy Altidore and Juan Pablo Ángel were also with Beckham, teaching skills to disadvantaged youth to benefit FC Harlem Lions.[269]  Appearances in films  Beckham never personally appeared in the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham, except in archive footage. He and his wife wanted to make cameo appearances, but scheduling proved difficult, so the director used lookalike Andy Harmer instead.[270]  Beckham makes a cameo appearance with Zinedine Zidane and Raúl, in the 2005 film Goal!. Harmer also doubled for him in the party scene.[271] Beckham himself appears in the sequel Goal II: Living the Dream[272] in a larger role, when the film's lead character gets transferred to Real Madrid. This time, the story centres on the Real Madrid team, and besides Beckham, other real life Real Madrid players also appear on and off the pitch, alongside the fictional characters. Though the use of stock footage from the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Beckham appeared in Goal III: Taking on the World, which was released straight to DVD on 15 June 2009.[273] Beckham has expressed no personal interest in pursuit of acting roles, saying he is too ""stiff"".[274]  However, due to his friendship with Guy Ritchie, he has made two cameo appearances in Ritchie's films: as a projectionist in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (based on the 1964 MGM television series of the same name),[275] and as Trigger in King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.[276]  Beckham has played along to jokes about his voice. In a 2018 promo for Deadpool 2, Beckham is seen watching the first instalment of the film franchise in which Ryan Reynolds' character compares Beckham's voice to inhaling helium.[277] Beckham is seen rolling his eyes at the voice jibe before receiving an apology text from Deadpool. Beckham answers his door to the antihero who presents him with milk and cookies, before Deadpool knocks again and has a bunch of helium-filled red balloons.[277]  Records  Beckham captained England 59 times,[278] the fourth highest after Bobby Moore and Billy Wright both with 90, and Bryan Robson with 65. With his free kick goal against Ecuador in the second round of the 2006 World Cup, Beckham gained membership into two of football's exclusive clubs: he became the only English player – and the 21st player in the world – to score in three World Cups; Real Madrid teammate Raúl also achieved this feat a few days earlier.[279] It also made him only the fifth player in World Cup history to score twice from a direct free kick; the other four were Pelé, Roberto Rivelino, Teófilo Cubillas, and Bernard Genghini (Beckham had previously scored this way against Colombia in the first round of the 1998 World Cup). All three goals were against South American teams (Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador) and from set pieces (the two aforementioned free kicks and a penalty against Argentina).[162][177]  Tattoos  As of 2016, Beckham had more than 40 tattoos.[280] There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn, and of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed on his left forearm, is in Sanskrit script because Beckham thought it would be ""tacky"" to have it in English. Unfortunately, this was misspelt as the equivalent of ""Vihctoria"".[281] In his autobiography David Beckham: My Side, he said that the idea of having tattoos came to him in 1999 after his son Brooklyn was born, following a conversation on the subject of tattoos with Mel B and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar. Beckham said: ""I ended up going to this Dutch guy who'd done all of Jimmy's. I'd finally realised what I wanted a tattoo to represent. Mine are all about the people in my life, my wife and sons, who I want with me always. When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me.""[282]  Awards  Career statistics  Club  [285][286]  International  [287][288][289]  England national team Year Apps Goals 1996 3 0 1997 9 0 1998 8 1 1999 7 0 2000 10 0 2001 10 5 2002 9 3 2003 9 4 2004 12 2 2005 9 1 2006 8 1 2007 5 0 2008 8 0 2009 8 0 Total 115 17  International goals  Scores and results list England's goal tally first.[290][291]  Honours  Club  Manchester United Youth  Manchester United[246]  Real Madrid[246]  LA Galaxy[246]  Paris Saint-Germain[246]  Individual  Orders and special awards  Records  See also  References  Books  Beckham, David (2002).

"There is growing speculation that Oprah Winfrey may challenge the president in 2020 after her rousing speech at Sunday's Golden Globes. Winfrey's best friend and ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King said on Tuesday ""I do think she's intrigued by the idea.""  Winfrey's partner, Stedman Graham, started much of the talk when he told the Los Anegels Times on Sunday that she would ""absolutely"" run, but ultimately it was ""up to the people.""  Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision for Lindt Chocolate/AP Images  King addressed Graham's comments and said that he had misinterpreted the reporter's question.  ""Stedman says that he thought the reporter said to him 'Would she make a good president?' And he said 'Absolutely she would.' That's how he interpreted the question, because this is the thing – Stedman would never so cavalierly say absolutely she would do it. It's up to the people. He would never do that,"" King said.  While King insisted that Winfrey is not ""actively considering"" a run for president, she also said, ""She loves this country and would like to be of service in some way.""  According to King, Winfrey was originally asked by producers to keep her speech at Sunday's Golden Globes to three minutes long. She insisted on keeping it at six minutes and when it was all said and done, it lasted for about nine.  ""I think the producers thought that was worth going late for,"" King said. ""She wanted that moment to be more than women wearing black dresses of solidarity. She really did want to speak to young girls around the country. She really did want to say 'enough already' and I think she delivered on all that in a very eloquent way. Will she run for president? I think it's a very very intriguing idea myself.""  Read King's full comments below.  NORAH O'DONNELL: ""So what about what Stedman said?""  GAYLE KING: ""I do think that's interesting because Stedman says that he thought the reporter said to him would she make a good president and he said absolutely she would. That's how he interpreted the question, because this is the thing. Stedman would never so cavalierly say absolutely she would do it. It's up to the people. He would never do that.  KING: ""I got emails from people yesterday that said is Stedman being strategic or is he being supportive? He is nothing but supportive. He would never just throw it out there like that.""  O'DONNELL: ""I'm going to ask you the same tough question that I ask guests on this show. In fact, Stedman did say she would absolutely do it. It's up to the people.""  KING: ""He did say it is up to the people but I'm telling you his interpretation of the question was would she – he thought the reporter was saying would she be a good president.""  O'DONNELL: ""Is she considering it?""  KING: ""No, I absolutely don't think that her position has changed. I don't. You know, I was up talking to her very late last night. I do think this though, guys. I do think she's intrigued by the idea. I do think that. I also know after years of watching the Oprah show, you always have a right to change your mind. I don't think at this point she is actually considering it. But listen, there are people who have said they want to be her campaign manager, who want to quit their jobs and campaign for her. She loves this country and would like to be of service in some way, but I don't think that she's actively considering it.""  JEFF GLOR: ""For the record that is a significant change – that is a change from what we heard in October.""  KING: ""It's not a change from her, Jeff. That's a change from me. It's not a change from her.""  O'DONNELL: ""So let me ask you, who wrote the speech?""  KING: ""Listen, Oprah crafted that speech. She knew how she wanted to start. This was the thing for her: she knew exactly what she wanted to say and she knew how she wanted to say it. She crafted the speech, she talked to an editor at the magazine and the two of them came up with it, but Oprah put down exactly what she wanted to say. Those were all her words. You know, listen, she writes her 'What I Know For Sure' column every week – every month in the magazine. She's a very good writer. We all know she's a very good talker and so I think that it was a home run on many levels. Being in that room I will say this: Being in that room was electrifying. It was the right person giving the right speech at the right time. She wanted that moment to be more than women wearing black dresses of solidarity. She really did want to speak to young girls around the country. She really did want to say enough already and I think she delivered on all that in a very eloquent way. Will she run for president? I think it's a very very intriguing idea myself.""  GLOR: ""If someone were to potentially run for president, what do you think their timeline might be?""  KING (looking at newspaper headline): ""I don't know, Jeff. I'm just looking at, this 'Yes She Can.' 'Noprah' if you took out the 'p' it would say Norah. I don't think there is such a thing as a timeline. I'm not trying to be cute here or be mysterious but I do think it's a very intriguing thing that she had never considered. People said 'oh yeah, she wrote that speech as a launching pad for what she wants to do.' That's absolutely not true. She worked on it, she rehearsed it, she practiced it. I was a practice audience member and I have to say I knew the speech was going to be powerful just when she was reading it to time. And you'll like this: before when she was at rehearsal they told her she had to cut three minutes out of it because it was six minutes long. They said you have to cut it to three minutes and Oprah said if it was any other night than this one I could do that but I don't plan on cutting it. As it turned out with all the applause it went nine minutes and I think they were very pleased – I think the producers thought that was worth going late for.""  O'DONNELL: ""Wow, well, I'm glad to have you back.""  KING: ""Norah, I am glad to be back. No matter what happens, I will be at 'CBS This Morning.' """,0
